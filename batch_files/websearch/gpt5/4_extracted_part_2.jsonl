The committee met, pursuant to call, at 10:10 a.m. in room 210, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. John R. Kasich (chairman of the committee) presiding. Members present: Representatives Kasich, Chambliss, Herger, Franks, Smith, Hilleary, Sununu, Collins, Wamp, Green, Fletcher, Miller, Ryan, Toomey, Spratt, Rivers, Minge, Price, Hoeffel, and Moran. Chairman Kasich. The committee will come to order. We will get started, Mr. Nader, and get you up there. I want to thank everybody who is going to be testifying today, and I think everybody has heard of Ralph Nader, especially if you ever drove a Corvair. Of course, Ralph, most of the people in this room don't even know what a Corvair is. That shows that you and I both are getting older, doesn't it? We are also going to have a panel of Members, former members, and experts who are going to examine corporate subsidies and the way in which they might be curtailed. We had a State representative from Pennsylvania who couldn't make it; and T.G. Rodgers, the president of Cypress Semiconductor, wanted to be here, but he had problems with a conflict. There are a number of people who are going to submit written testimony which I think we will find interesting, and we are here today really to examine the proper role of the Federal Government in regards to our free market and our free enterprise system. Ralph, I think as you know, and John, as you know, I have been subject to some criticism by people in the business community because I have decided that it was necessary to try to clean up this subject area that I call corporate welfare. I believe very strongly in free enterprise and believe very strongly in free markets. I believe that free enterprise and free markets can only occur when there are limits on government, and I am a passionate supporter and believer in this capitalist system because what it allows us to do is to take ideas way from the back of our heads and be able to translate those ideas into products that, in fact, can make improvements for every individual on the face of the earth, and I think during the course of my lifetime there was a long argument about which economic system is the most humane, and we tried all kinds of systems around the world. Most of them top down, capitalist system being one that stresses the individual, and I fundamentally believe is a bottom up system, and I think what we know as the greatest threat to our free enterprise system is growing government, government that gets in the middle by excessive regulation or, for that matter, that creates a program of subsidies that tries to pick winners and losers. So if, in fact, you are a strong supporter of free enterprise and of free markets and if you believe in capitalism, then you ought to be working aggressively on Capitol Hill to end these special subsidies that businesses get that distort the marketplace and result in the government of the United States picking winners and losers. And it is interesting that those persons who tend to be the strongest supporters of free enterprise and free market often tend to believe these subsidies are appropriate; I have got to call attention to the fact that there is a great, great inconsistency. I am particularly against the government subsidies that accrue to some but not to all companies in the United States, and I am against the special deals that are provided to many businesses from government. The problem is many times the special deals, ladies and gentlemen, go to the largest companies in America. A small businessman living on main Street can't get the same kind of benefits that some of the very largest multinational corporations can get inside of this country. Steve Moore, who, Ralph, would be a strange ally of yours, is going to testify here today, and he has noted in the past, quote, there are hundreds of thousands, millions of small businesses that pay taxes that do not participate in these special programs. And so to me, it really is matter of fairness, and it really is a matter of the proper role of a limited government. I argued back in 1995 that if we were going to reform welfare for poor people in America, which we have done, then we need to reform welfare for rich people in America because America is about a sense of fairness. What is good for the goose is good for the gander, and we have been vigilant in trying to maintain this welfare reform that we put in place and have made some slight progress in the area of tailoring subsidies to business. And I have got to go all the way back to 1995 and a number of the provisions that were reformed, Mr. Nader, in this Congress that for example closed the loophole on the largest pharmaceutical firms in Puerto Rico that had a special advantage. Most of my lifetime I heard people yell and scream and shout, many liberals, against and rail against these particular subsidies, but yet never saw anything done; and I want to pay particular tribute to Bill Archer and many members of the republican party who actually stood up and closed some of these loopholes. Now, I know that your view would be it is just the tip of the iceberg, but you have got to get started when you are in an effort to try to reign in this area of corporate welfare. I think there is a whole collection of programs that we can talk about today, programs that I believe should be eliminated because of unnecessary subsidies, and we will have a list displayed sometime of the top 10 items that many of these other groups and panels think should be high on our list. There are programs like the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which provides subsidized loans and insurance for companies to invest in some of the world's riskiest overseas markets. It is interesting to note that these programs are used by some of our largest corporations, including, for example, McDonalds, which gets advantages on insurance programs and loan programs to operate in various parts of the world; and I want to them operate in various parts of the world, but I don't understand why the government ought to be providing them some kind of an insurance program that the lady out in my own hometown who makes cookies can't get for her operation. If you want to go overseas, God bless you, go. There is plenty of money to be made, but don't ask the taxpayers to try to foot the bill to give you certain advantages to go overseas, particularly when you are large and you have had a great history of success. Then there is the sugar program. Now, I don't know where you are on sugar, Ralph. I think you are probably off the mark on this one, I am not sure; but, you know, we limit the importation of sugar in the United States which drives up the cost of sugar for every American family to twice the price of what it should be, and at the same time I think, as we all know, there has been significant environmental damage as a result of sugar production in this country. And the fact is, it makes no sense in America today to not permit an open and free market in regard to a commodity like sugar. Then there is the advanced technology program whereby we give grants to some of the largest and most profitable companies. We have an $8 trillion economy. We also have an R&D tax credit, a research and development tax credit, that I happen to support. I know there will be a witness here today that hates the research and development tax credit, but I think it is a program that encourages the kind of research that we need to develop the products that we need but to have on top of it a grant program in this $8 trillion economy that passes out grants. In fact GAO interviewed grant winners. They concluded that half of the recipients would have conducted the research even without government funding and that government funding goes to some of the largest corporations in the United States. They don't need that kind of money. It is picking winners and losers, something that I know many in my party rail about all the time. Then we have got the power marketing administration which is located within the Department of Energy, which provides subsidized electricity to many parts of the country paid for by the people who sit in this room; and the fact is we have entered an era of electric deregulation where we are trying to take utilities and we are trying to put them more in tune with the market that we think will provide huge advantages to consumers, and yet here we still maintain the power of marketing administrations. Secretary Robert Mosbacher, the former Secretary of Commerce, said the Department of Commerce is nothing more than a hall closet where you throw in everything that you don't know what to do with. That is the department that contains the advanced technology program. I found it a little bit different than that. I think it is a place where you put your kid when he worked on a presidential campaign and he couldn't get a job in the White House so you stick him in the Commerce Department. By the way, it was the commerce department that participated in the granting of licenses to companies that have sold sensitive technologies to other countries, particularly the Chinese. So I have got to tell you that when you look at the department of energy or you look at the Department of Commerce, as you know, I have been in favor of eliminating both of them. I not only think we would have saved money; but, frankly, I think our nation would have been more secure had we been able to consolidate many of the programs, rid ourselves of many of the unnecessary programs, professionalize the remaining functions so we not only were to save money, eliminated some corporate welfare; but at the same time I believe made ourselves more secure. When you take a look at the Department of Energy and the fact that we have not been able to professionalize or consolidate any of those laboratories, when bureaucracy gets too big, it is unresponsive and even today that we make directives to the Department of Energy, and it appears the people in there just ignore the directives. I think this is going to be a long process. Somebody asked me have you given up on this battle of corporate welfare, and I said I have not because it is a matter of fairness; but Mr. Nader, I have to tell you that it has been very difficult here to even get groups who are interested in doing away with unnecessary subsidies to be able to come together, sit at a table together and come up with a simple list of 10 items that they can all agree upon ought to go. This is going to be, I think, a 10-year battle to start to do away with some of these subsidies, but we started this battle a couple of years ago. We have had some significant, yet still small, victories, including the area of timber. We have made some progress but it is going to be a long, long process to try to eliminate these special benefits that people get in this country that don't accrue to most folks on Main Street. I know you have been working on this since about 1975, I think, is when you wrote your first piece, and what I am pleased about is both the liberals and conservatives--you hate to use those terms today--but liberals and conservatives, people on all sides of the political spectrum, see the need to eliminate these subsidies, to restore a sense of limited government, to restore a sense of fairness in terms of the role of the Federal Government. And so, Mr. Nader, I am prepared to march on and keep the battle going and hopefully be joined by some business interests. There are some that share our concern about these unnecessary subsidies. Go out to the Silicon Valley and you talk to them about the advanced technology program, they laugh at you. Bill Gates, along with his cohorts, didn't need an advanced technology program to develop this magical invention called the computer. In fact, had we had a lot of government programs, he probably would have never developed it. As I like to say, people didn't know--people in Washington didn't know anybody who lived in San Jose and then when they found they lived out there, they didn't know what they did, and to prove that to you, we thought Y2K could be fixed with one little switch, only to find out that it is far more complicated than that. I appreciate your being here today, Mr. Nader, but I also want to pay tribute to Bob Shamansky, former Member of Congress who is a friend of mine. He is a very passionate man who also has some areas that he is going to discuss with us today. He is here in attendance and will appear later, plus a whole panel of people. This will take about all day to get through all of this testimony, but I just think it is important we shed light on this matter and I think in the process rally the support of the American people out of a sense of fairness that we can restore the proper role of government as it relates to this free enterprise, free market system. Mr. Spratt is recognized. Mr. Spratt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think this is what this committee ought to be doing. We have a certain detachment and disinterest that other committees don't have. Appropriations, for example, spends money; Ways and Means looks for different ways to use the tax code creatively. We have a special detachment and disinterest that allows us to give an unflinching examination to targeted tax breaks, special interest spending, subsidies, things that have been in the budget for a long time and served a purpose at one time but may not serve a purpose anymore. We need to scrub it, scrub the whole budget periodically. I am glad we are doing it. As I look through the materials before us, though, I see a lot of old targets that have been resurrected that have been taken on before and they survived. A lot of these have survived not because they serve some special interest that happens to make big PAC contributions or have friends in the right places. They survived because when they were challenged in committee and on the House floor, Members of the House have trooped to the floor, scores of Members, who testified to their utility. A good example is the Economic Development Administration. The reason it has survived is not because it has been overlooked. Goodness sake, it has been a frequent target; but time and again, when it is targeted, Members on both sides of the aisle stand up and say, I have seen what EDA did in my district. It was the grantor of last resort when we needed money for a sewer line or a water line and this was the linchpin in bringing in new industry to an underdeveloped area and to a high unemployment area. EDA was there when nobody else was there. It served a useful purpose. I dare say the same is true of the Commerce Department. You can abolish the Commerce Department, but you have got all the component parts of it. All you would do is chop off the head of it. If you kill the secretariat, somebody, I hope, will still watch the weather; somebody, I hope, will still take the census and all of its functions, most of its functions. The vast majority of these will be accomplished somewhere else. So I think we need to bear that in mind, and as we go through this day-long hearing, try to develop some sort of rubric, some sort of logic for what we are doing. We are looking at special interests, deciding whether or not these interests ought to be served. We are looking at government subsidies, deciding whether or not they still serve a worthy purpose. In some cases I think they may. We are looking for programs that have been lost in the thicket of the tax code. It ought to be pulled back up, the thicket of government spending, a trillion seven, to see if they can still pass muster. It is a good thing for us to be doing and I appreciate it; but as we do it, let us bear in mind that sometimes sweeping claims that have been made in the past about certain of these programs, EDA is an example, haven't stood scrutiny and won't stand scrutiny today. Good example. I am getting ready to go over to the Armed Services Committee, and I will be back shortly, Mr. Chairman, but I want to go hear about what the B-2 did in the recent war in the Balkans. There have been members--I won't mention names--who have challenged the B-2 before, on the grounds that it was excessively expensive, that the technology really wasn't worth what we were paying for it. It looks like the B-2 came through in this latest war, and so all of the old shibboleths need to be reconsidered from time to time. That is one of them. There will be many more that will be brought up today, and I think we ought to approach all of it with a fresh mind and an unbiased attitude. Thanks for calling the hearing, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Kasich. Boy, I would love to start another B-2 debate right here, Ralph, right now. Let us go at it. OK. I want to tell you that I want to thank Mr. Nader. He has been on this issue and on me personally to make sure that we would go forward with the hearing, and I want to thank him for his commitment to this, and Ralph, the floor is yours STATEMENT OF RALPH NADER, CONSUMER ADVOCATE Mr. Nader. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the House Budget Committee. Thanks for the opportunity to testify on the very vast subject of corporate welfare. Today's hearing is long overdue. There has never been a congressional hearing, to our knowledge, on the subject of corporate welfare, and so in a sense this is a historic occasion, and I hope it will stimulate further inquiry by the House Budget Committee and by other budget committees as well, because you have to stay the course in this area in order to get anything done. Mr. Chairman, you deserve major credit for issuing a clarion call for congressional attention to corporate welfare. At a time when profiles of courage are very rare indeed, it is quite clear that as you are running for President and having to raise funds under our present political system, you are also holding these very important hearings that might tweak the beak of some of these varied business interests, which is why I want to especially commend you. We need more of that kind of activity here on Capitol Hill. We have been working on corporate welfare issues for many years. One of my articles focused on a huge subsidy to the railroads which didn't do the railroads any good in 1972. In 1983 we put out a report called Aid for Dependent Corporations, AFDC, a study of the fiscal 1984 corporate welfare budget, and in 1985 a similar one and together with my entire testimony and these attachments and a few others which I will cite, I ask your permission to put them in the printed hearing record.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7748.147 Chairman Kasich. Without objection. Mr. Nader. The subject of corporate welfare is one that raises many, many questions of market distortions, of elementary fairness, of misallocation of public budgets, of environmental damage, and of the suppression of the rights of small business compared to large corporations that are more adept at feeding at the trough here in Washington. The looting of Uncle Sam, namely, the taxpayers, Mr. Chairman, is an ever-growing big business. And it is a big business that is largely secret, without procedural due process, without the usual safeguards that any ordinary business would establish for itself. If we are to take a working definition of corporate welfare, the concept of programs involving the government giving more to private companies than it gets back, that is, where it is engaging in a transaction that cannot be justified as a fair market value exchange, then the goal is not necessarily to eliminate all corporate welfare programs, although many certainly need elimination, but to subject them to procedural, substantive, and regular review safeguards. What are we talking about here in terms of corporate welfare? Well, I have here in my testimony a number of categories which will illustrate part but not the entire field because it is so vast. Even 20 years ago, Mr. Chairman, there was a report from the Congress that indicated over 120 Federal subsidy programs alone, and since then there has been a burgeoning both in degree and kind of these corporate welfare projects and programs. The first category deals with giveaways, and these are, of course, completely antithetical to the way any prudent operation would use its assets. No business gives away its assets. No trade union gives away its assets. No agricultural cooperative gives away its assets. But the U.S. Government is in the practice of giving away taxpayer assets, natural resource assets, research and development assets and many other assets such as the public airways without getting anything in return, without requiring any conditions for the transfer of these valuable assets. I might add that the estimates of corporate welfare at the local, State and Federal Government arenas is hundreds of billions of dollars year--that is with a B--hundreds of billions of dollars a year. The government retains its property in such things as oil and mineral riches, forests, thousands of buildings and plants, public works, the public airways over which television and radio stations transmit their programs. The government retains its property as the sheer commonwealth of the people of the United States, and when a reasoned decision is made to distribute some of this wealth to private companies, the government should explore whether it can distribute these public assets in a nonexclusive public-purpose way or in a way that promotes competition. When public assets are going to be distributed to private interests, there should be a strong presumption that the government should receive a market rate purchase or lease price. Now, let us look at an example. There is a recent digital spectrum giveaway. The Federal Communications Commission estimates its value is up to $70 billion, a figure that Bob Dole has used when he criticized this giveaway. The National Association of Broadcasters has trumped its critics, including its competitors, in getting this to its members free of charge. The broadcasters pay nothing to the public for the right to air programming over the public airways. The public is the landlord and the broadcasters are the tenant, and the tenant pays no rent and keeps the public off its own property for 24 hours a day in radio and television stations all over the country. There is no audience network. There are no cable channels for civic activity or for labor or students or anything like that. At the same time the broadcasters use the influence they gain over political representatives from their use of these public resources to extort still greater subsidies. And all the while, they don't allow this subject to be covered on their news programs. Has anybody seen the evening news of the networks talk about the great digital spectrum giveaway? No way. The opportunity reemerges in an effort to define the broadcasters' public interest obligation, and that is what we have to consider. Should the public airways be leased for a fair market exchange or should they be given away? And should the owners of the public airways have some of the time for their own broadcasting rights? As the Supreme Court put it in the Red Lion case, the first amendment rights of the audience of radio and TV stations are superior to the first amendment rights of the broadcasters, something we often are allowed to forget. Another giveaway is the 1872 Mining Act. This is a notoriously obsolete law that allows any company, domestic or foreign, to go on public lands should they discover hard rock minerals, like gold or molybdenum. They can go to the Department of Interior and for $5 an acre or less buy the land above the mine, mine the mine to exhaustion, keep all the revenues, with no royalties back to the U.S. Government, and little care for the environment. As a matter of fact, we checked some Third World countries, Mr. Chairman. They drive a harder bargain for their raw materials with U.S. corporations than our own government does. An example of this is that a Canadian gold mining company discovered $9 billion of gold in Nevada on Federal lands a few years ago, marked it out, went to the Department of Interior and bought the entire area covering that mine for $30,000. $30,000 investment, $9 billion in gold, no royalties back to the government. There is no business in its right mind that would operate in that fashion. There are also the Internet giveaways which are increasingly visible today. A giveaway of public assets involves the management of the U.S. Government's Internet assets. The current contract goes to Network Solutions. NSI turned a tiny initial investment into a firm with a market capitalization of $2.5 billion thanks to the control of the power to sell the public the right to use their own domain names. It is just a clerical situation. It is as if the U.S. Trademark office was transferred to a private company to operate for private purposes. A domain name now costs $18 for 2 years. We have been advised by other companies they could do it for 50 cents and still make a significant profit. Government research and development is a little more complex issue, Mr. Chairman. It is clear that without government research and development, the telecommunications industry today, the aerospace industry, the agribusiness industry, the computer industry, the biotech industry, the pesticide industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the atomic power industry, the satellite industry and some of the construction housing industry would not be the same as they are today. Indeed, many of these government research and development dollars were invested in activities that the companies themselves did not choose to risk their capital in investing. Instead, they launched a variety of programs from the Pentagon, from NASA, from the National Institutes of Health, et cetera, and it is important when these companies tout their enterprise initiative that we also say that a good deal of their success is due to taxpayers' initiatives or taxpayers' enterprise under these government R&D programs. But since the early 1980's especially, the government has routinely given away the fruits of the research it sponsors, granting private corporations exclusive royalty-free rights to commercialize government-financed inventions, while failing to include or enforce any reasonable pricing requirements and the like. Now, when it comes to an anticancer drug like Taxol, Mr. Chairman, the National Cancer Institute said a few years ago that $31 million of taxpayer money went into the synthesis of the yew tree out of Oregon and Washington State all the way through the human clinical trials to develop this important drug. Under government policy, the government, in effect, gave monopoly marketing power to Bristol-Myers Squibb to sell this drug. Selling an anticancer drug does not require great marketing genius, by the way. Bristol-Myers Squibb is earning revenues from Taxol of $1 billion a year. There are no royalties back to NIH to recycle into more research and development in the health sciences, and there is no reasonable pricing. A few months ago, a woman with ovarian cancer wrote us. She had to leave her $19,000-a-year job. She went to the doctor. He said this was a very serious case. All he could recommend was Taxol, and it was $2,000 a shot from Bristol-Myers, basically close to $14,000 for the series of treatments that she needed out of a drug that the taxpayer developed right through the human clinical trial. I don't think that is fair. I don't think that is right for the patient, for the taxpayer. If she has to go on Medicaid to pay for this drug, the taxpayer pays from the other end as well. In a little known activity in the Department of Defense over at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, there is what the generals and the admirals call the government's little drug company. The government's little drug company has been engaging in first-class science with incredible efficiencies in developing antimalarial drugs and other drugs that the pharmaceutical industry doesn't want to put any money into because they don't see much profits in it. Malaria kills 2.5 million people a year, including 1 million children in Africa; and there is very little private medical research investment. Walter Reed has a policy, after they develop the drugs-- which by the way cost about $5 million a year a drug, not counting salaries--they give it away to a company. Recently, the government scientists developed a hepatitis drug, and in a ceremony, the happy company that received the exclusive rights gave the military officials there a plaque in appreciation. A plaque! So whether it is only 1 percent royalties or a plaque, that is about all the return the taxpayer gets, not to mention the gouging prices for consumers. The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles needs to be given some attention. This is Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton's initiative started in August 1993. They joined with GM, Ford, and Chrysler to produce what is allegedly going to be a clean- engine car. Six years later, there is almost nothing to show for this. Why is the U.S. Government using a billion dollars of tax money to subsidize three companies that have been reporting record profits year after year and should be investing in this technology on their own? And it isn't just the waste of taxpayer money, Mr. Chairman. It is a de facto exemption from the antitrust laws that seems especially unwise given the history of the auto companies colluding, to restrain the development and marketing of pollution control systems. A Justice Department case on this matter resulted in a consent decree under the Nixon administration, and I wish to introduce the material in the record to substantiate that. Given that record, do we really want to impede competition for this kind of innovation? It is interesting as the Washington Times reported on Saturday--and I submit that article for the record--that the two companies that are going to come forward next year with the most fuel-efficient cars by far are Toyota and Honda. They are not part of this joint government-business partnership for a clean car. They are part of a more competitive arena which is why they are ahead of the domestic U.S. industry, unfortunately. We come now to bailouts. Everybody in Congress is familiar with the periodic demand by industry for bailouts, the largest one being the S&L bailout due to speculation, outright criminal behavior or mismanagement in the late 1980's and early 1990's. It will cost the taxpayer over the next 20, 30 years, $500 billion in principal and interest. Bailouts are different from other corporate welfare categories in that they are ad hoc and unplanned. There is no ongoing government bailout program to be canceled or reformed, but there are lessons to be learned, and first is the issue of payback. The question is simple. Once the S&Ls got on their feet after the bailout and they started making money, why shouldn't they pay the taxpayer back for the bailout? And in addition, why shouldn't systems be in place so that there is never again this kind of rampant speculation which is caught only too late by lackadaisical government agencies at the State and Federal level--which in turn has to lead to a huge bailout and a distortion of both market and budgetary priorities? The danger of creating too-big-to-fail institutions should make corporate welfare opponents advocates of a strong antitrust policy and supporters of existing restraints on the concentration of economic power. H.R. 10, which is about to come before the House of Representatives, is a bill that is going to facilitate the combinations of giant banks, giant insurance companies, and giant brokerage houses; and this means that there are going to be more of these joint firms on the too-big-to-fail list of the U.S. Government, and that means the U.S. taxpayer. And yet the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has stopped assessing these profitable banks for the rainy days ahead. It only has $32 billion on hand to cover all contingencies for 9,000 commercial banks with nearly $3 trillion in deposits. Now Citicorp itself has assets of over $350 billion, and we know big banks can get into big trouble indeed. So, why is the Federal Government in effect saying to the banks, ``Well, you don't have to be assessed anymore for your insurance fund because the taxpayer is always going to be ready to bail you out once this relatively trivial amount of FDIC resources is exhausted should there be one or two major bank failures?'' There is also corporate tax expenditures. Now, this is where there is some debate between opponents of corporate welfare; but in our view, Federal corporate tax expenditures are the back door to corporate welfare. They are very invisible. Once they get installed, they don't have to be annually reviewed by the Appropriations Committees of Congress. They just go on and on and on. These corporate tax expenditures are not uniform tax cuts. They are selective tax preferences for particular business interests, usually large businesses, not small businesses, as you pointed out in your introductory statement. The crusade against corporate welfare cannot exclude corporate tax expenditures anymore than it can exclude direct government subsidies to corporations. As many scholars have pointed out, the tax expenditure is equivalent to a Treasury check to the preferred corporation or industry. Here is how it works: In the late 1970's in a very obscure provision in one of the tax bills, $10 billion of taxes on deferred export earnings by McDonald Douglas, Boeing, General Electric and others was wiped off the book. I suppose a lot of small taxpayers would like their debt wiped off the book to Uncle Sam, but they are not big enough to have that kind of influence. Imagine about $10 billion, this is a so-called ``DISC'' program, wiped off the book with almost no public attention because of the obscure way it was done. Corporate debt cancellation buried in 500- or 600-page bills is a routine performance on Capitol Hill. In 1986, there was another tax preference in one of the giant 1,500-page bills. Almost nobody understood it. It took the Washington Post months to discover it. That gave Ford and General Motors $1.5 billion tax break, and more recently, eight billion out of $11 billion that the electric utilities owe to Uncle Sam was removed and canceled as well. I am sure a lot of small businesses would like to have that kind of power on Capitol Hill, but they don't. OMB should be required to compile a list of the top 50 beneficiaries of each corporate tax expenditure. And to ensure these expenditures are disclosed and receive congressional scrutiny in some setting, these and other disclosures that are recommended in my testimony should all be put on the Internet. By the way, Mr. Chairman, do you know who invented the Internet? It wasn't Al Gore. It was the Pentagon. The Pentagon invented the Internet to communicate on military research between universities, contractors and itself. Once again, we see the taxpayer risk often is in advance of the market willing to take risks to develop these kinds of breakthroughs. Insurance schemes. The International Monetary Fund and the Enhanced Stabilization Fund in the Treasury are typical examples of corporate welfare, albeit indirect. Corporate globalization leads to interdependence. Nobody denies that. But it also leads to Uncle Sam being the global guarantor of some of the worst regimes and their mismanaged economic policies and the speculation in these countries. It started with Mexico. It extended to countries in East Asia. It has moved to Brazil. It went to Russia where billions of IMF dollars disappeared without a trace as that country wallows in the criminal capitalism which replaced its criminal communism. The IMF and the ESF infuse money into debtor country economies which then goes right back out to pay foreign creditors, often our own large banks and other money centers in the U.S. What is interesting about the IMF and the ESF--and this is extremely important for Congress--is that these decisions are made without congressional authority often. They are made without congressional hearings. They are made without congressional review. They are made by executive branch officials with unbridled discretion and with the utmost secrecy. If you ask yourselves procedurally how was the $50 million bailout made to Mexico, it was not made with anything that Congress was involved in. It is one of the most egregious upsetting of the separation of powers and the balance of powers in our Federal system. I should also mention the nuclear insurance. Chairman Kasich. So I would put you down as opposed to that? Mr. Nader. Yes. In fact, this is an area that might be called meta-law. When you consider that a package of that size could be developed by the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, and the IMF, and Congress is completely kept out of it, I think that is an example of why procedural safeguards need to be right up at the top of the list in any analysis in Congress of corporate welfare. These procedural safeguards are constitutional safeguards. The nuclear industry could never pass the private insurance market test. Whenever an industry has a product that cannot meet a private insurance market test, the yellow flags go up. Why doesn't the insurance company want to insure this product or this industry? And so the Price Anderson Act was passed by Congress in the 1950's, in effect, to subsidize in a huge way the nuclear power industry and to cap the liability of the industry at a ridiculous tiny fraction of the level of what a nuclear accident would damage around a nuclear facility. In fact, the Atomic Energy Commission put out an estimate in the early 1960's that said that if there's a nuclear power accident, a class nine accident, it would contaminate an area the size of Pennsylvania. This was a regulatory agency, you know, that was the big booster of the nuclear industry. If an industry which has benefited, as the nuclear industry has, from massive government research and development and other subsidies for more than 4 decades and which creates staggering environmental waste disposal programs yet to be resolved, as well as other risks, if it cannot survive without government support, then it should not survive. The over $100 billion that has gone into the nuclear industry, and some estimates are triple that, over the years could have been put into energy efficiency technology. This would have been a much more rational, economic decision for millions of consumers and taxpayers who are now burdened by the nuclear power risk situation. Government-sponsored enterprises. These are GSEs, and it is interesting that many people in Congress who are against government involvement in business never speak out against Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and others. In fact, they are terrified of Fannie Mae. I mentioned recently to the CEO of Fannie Mae, I don't know any other company that produces such fear as Fannie Mae on Capitol Hill. Perhaps it is because they hire so many former government officials and put them on their payroll to influence the situation. According to the Congressional Budget Office, for every $2 delivered to homeowners due to the government subsidies of the GSEs (which was $6.5 billion in 1995, according to CBO), Fannie and Freddie Mac, take $1 of that subsidy for themselves. That is for executive salaries, for their shareholders, et cetera. There has been very little review or oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and there are some companies who believe that they represent unfair competition to other companies who think they can do as good or better a job. Now, there are some people who say they are not going to be able to do as good or better job in the housing finance area, but we will never know unless they are able to try on a level playing field. The questions for Congress: Could GSEs improve access to mortgages by home buyers without a government subsidy? Could private corporations without government corporate welfare perform the same function? The executive compensation issue is also pretty egregious. Let me ask you this. You are working for the Federal Government as Members of Congress. They pay you about $136,000 plus benefits, et cetera. Jamie Gorelick worked for the Justice Department. She got about $125,000 as a high Justice Department official. She leaves the government, and in 1997 moves over to Fannie Mae as vice-chair with no experience in housing finance. She is paid $1,850,000 in salary, bonuses and stock options during the last 8 months of that year. Now, should a government subsidize a corporation that pays its executives at those stratospheric levels, including a former CEO of Fannie Mae who went away with a $20 million severance package, not to mention the $5 million that the more recently resigned CEO Jim Johnson received in 1 year? That is something that is quite important to pay attention to. I want to devote a few comments to State and local corporate welfare. And right in your home State, Mr. Chairman, there is a perfect example of what you are pointing out today in your prefatory remarks, and it is in Toledo, Ohio. Chrysler has been in Toledo for many years. The workers are very productive. The Jeep is produced there and sold at a good profit. Chrysler decided to expand the Jeep plant. They went to Toledo's city government, which is financially strapped, and arranged with the city government for a $300 million Federal, State, and local subsidy package. Part of that involves taking over land where there are 85 homes in a stable neighborhood and several small businesses. We have been out to Toledo several times, Mr. Chairman, and we have seen the maps; and for the 300-acre parcel for that plant, the only use for that devastated neighborhood, which is being plowed under now by bulldozers and paid for by Toledo taxpayers to the homeowners, is going to be landscaping. The top area of that parcel is more than large enough for the new truck plant and for the staging areas for the trucks. There is a small business with 70 employees, roof repair business, that is going to be displaced by that plant. Chrysler is given a tax holiday in property taxes. The Toledo city government absorbs all environmental risks. The Toledo city government, which is very seriously strapped, has to pay for the clearing of the land and preparing of the land for this private corporation. This small business which is going to be displaced has to pay its property taxes, has to pay its dues, but the giant Daimler Chrysler corporation with $20 billion in cash does not have to pay its property taxes to the city of Toledo. When I called up the general counsel of Chrysler, Lewis Goldfarb, and I said tell me---- Chairman Kasich. I bet he was excited to get your call. Mr. Nader. Yes. Why does a company with $20 billion in cash bring the city of Toledo to its knees and refuse to do what any homeowner in Toledo and what any small business in Toledo has to do, pay their dues, pay their taxes, pay for their own land purchasing? Why? And his answer was because we are putting a billion dollars investment in this plant. I said, well, small business puts money in their stores and their plants. It is all proportional. Are you saying that because you are big enough, you can get away with being a property tax escapee, even though you are burdening the city services, the schools, the police, the fire departments? Basically, they have the power to do it, Mr. Chairman, and they are going to do it. The cities are terrified that these companies will leave, so the companies pit one State against another. The cities and states crumble just like Detroit crumbled when GM put up its plant in the Poletown neighborhood with another $300 million-plus package of Federal, state and local subsidies. And I might add, 400 homes, 12 churches, a hospital, and dozens of small businesses were leveled for this plant, which ended up producing half the jobs it promised and only used a small portion of the 400 acres from which the Poletown community was evicted. Intel corporation is another example. They build billion dollar plants in small towns in the West, and they cut very, very harsh deals with these towns, including escaping $50 million per plant in property and other local taxes, notwithstanding that they have burdened the schools, the police, the service, sewage, water, et cetera, and other services. I asked Intel CEO, Andy Grove, how can you as a relative statesman among corporate executives allow this to happen? He gave me a pained look and he said, you know, these communities just throw themselves at you, and we have an obligation to our shareholders. But not an obligation to support the community, apparently. It gets even worse. There are now corporate subsidies to gambling casinos. Thirty years ago, if you asked any Member of Congress, do you think that there would ever be corporate subsidies to gambling casinos, they would have thought you were off your rocker. Yet Governor Whitman of New Jersey has taken $200 million to build a 1-mile or so tunnel into a new gambling casino that gambling mogul Steve Wynn is going to build in Atlantic City. Never mind that the schools in New Jersey are crumbling. Never mind that the public works in New Jersey are crumbling. $200 million for a tunnel into the land of hope and illusion. And that is not all. There are gambling casinos going up in Detroit where a whole series of small business are being taken, and displaced, and where taxpayers are funding gambling casinos. Imagine: Detroit used to be the hub of the greatest manufacturing center in the world. People worked for the future instead of bet on the future. Now they are going to rely on gambling casinos for economic development when gambling takes it out of the hide of lower-income people more than any other strata of our society. To end local and state corporate welfare and other Federal corporate welfare, I would recommend congressional hearings-- with the presence of some of the corporate welfare kings. Wouldn't it be nice to have some of the corporate welfare kings lined up here answering questions about why they are feeding at the public trough when they are producing huge profits, huge executive compensation? I think they should be asked to explain why they are blackmailing cities, counties and States, often just to build stadiums or arenas, while other, desperately needed public works are starved of the money. Congressional hearings should also probe whether the provision of tax subsidies and similar incentives distort economic decision-making concerning the location of business activity, therefore, constitute an unconstitutional infringement on Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. This is an analysis done on this matter in great detail in the December 1996 Harvard Law Review in an article by law professor Peter Enrich, which is cited in my testimony. I suspect there is going to be a lawsuit filed evoking that commerce clause concept very shortly in Federal court. Second, the States need to be authorized and encouraged to enter into compacts in which they refuse to enter a race to the bottom against each other in terms of special tax breaks and related benefits. That will probably require congressional legislation to authorize these kinds of interstate compacts. And as you will hear shortly, Representative David Minge has a bill here in the House that would authorize the Federal Government to levy a surtax on companies receiving state and local tax breaks, at the very least treating the value of the tax breaks as income upon which Federal taxes should be paid. That is another way of generating a more level playing field. Senator Mark Hatfield, Oregon Republican in the Senate, made a crusade over his years, Mr. Chairman, against corporate subsidies for private commercial weapons exports to foreign government. He didn't like it for a number of reasons, one of which was that it was a misuse of tax money. Second, it often supported dictators who repressed their own people. Third, some of the weapons were even used against U.S. military personnel. The amount of annual subsidy there is in the billions of dollars. He would give estimates around 6 to $7 billion. And then, of course, there is the highway pork which you have rendered some judgments on. You will hear later from a group that will detail some of the unnecessary highways and misdirected highways that are being---- Chairman Kasich. Mr. Nader, would you just suspend for a second. I don't want you to gloss over an issue you just mentioned, which is an issue called recoupment which I have been involved with. It is a very obscure issue, but it is one that really encourages the transfer of many--of weapons technologies, something that I know we have been concerned about in light of the transfer of technology recently. It is a very interesting program, and I did make an effort to take it out. It came out for about a nanosecond and then went back in, but it is a very interesting program in and of itself, just to underscore the issue of recoupment. Mr. Nader. There is also the issue of offsets. Chairman Kasich. The offsets. Mr. Nader. These are where countries who received these weapons exports cut deals and say, well, we want two-thirds of them to be built or we want something in return, and eventually, the technology is transferred to countries like China and other nations. Yes, I do mention that in my complete testimony. More recently, the Department of Defense Inspector General reported on spare parts provided to the Pentagon by Allied Signal Corporation that were sold at a 57-percent markup over commercial price. You know, when it comes to corporate issues, there isn't all that much difference between the two parties. How is this for an example? The Republicans never thought of doing this one. The Clinton administration is now having the Pentagon mergers by prime defense contractors subsidize. The argument is that there is a surplus of capacity in the defense industry, there should be mergers, and it is up to the Pentagon to facilitate these mergers with sweetened tax dollars. Our answer is, if there is overcapacity, let them cut their capacity the way it is done in the market system. Let them change over into doing something else. But Martin Marietta- Lockheed didn't need a billion and a half taxpayer dollars to get married. Then $30 million was reserved for executive bonuses until Bernie Sanders and the rest of the House of Representatives stopped that. And so now we have routinely companies merging and getting Pentagon subsidies as a result. This was something that the Clinton administration has innovated. Agricultural subsidies, you will hear probably a lot about that later, but the original purpose of farm supports, Mr. Chairman, was to support family farmers, not giant agribusiness and to enhance stability in agricultural markets. It is doubtful whether these programs still fill this function. At the same time, it is important to examine whether the 1996 farm bill had the unintended effect of promoting agribusiness consolidation and increased power for grain traders at the expense of small farm viability, whether that is happening at an accelerating pace which suggests the need for a serious and open-minded reassessment of these farm programs. I think it is important, Mr. Chairman, to develop this analytic framework to give the corporate welfare examination process the proper stamina and intensiveness. There are some simple questions that you can ask for any corporate welfare program. Does it serve some broad public purpose? That suggests it has merits beyond the benefits it confers upon a particular corporation. If not, the program should be canceled. If it does serve some public interest, can the government achieve the same ends or, more important, public goals by retaining an interest in an asset being given away or doing a service in-house? Third, does the program involve functions that should be properly left to the marketplace? Fourth, if the government is going to distribute assets or contracts or tax breaks to selected private parties, can it do so in a nonexclusive way so that competition is promoted? This business of giving away taxpayer assets to exclusive monopoly recipients is antithetical to everything the competitive market should stand for. Admiral Rickover had a simple idea. He said, look, open it up to competitive bidding if you want to give away a drug that the government develops like Taxol or a particular piece of hardware innovation. If you are going to transfer it, open it up to nonexclusive competitive bidding for 6 months. If it doesn't get a nibble, then you can negotiate maybe a sole source transfer. That was Admiral Rickover's approach, and as you know he had enormous experience in government-corporate contracting details. Five, if the government is going to provide corporations with services or give away its assets, is there any reason it shouldn't charge a market rate? Should it charge a below-market rate like with timber sales? There were years, for example, when 150-foot spruce trees in the Tongas Forest in Alaska was sold for the price of a hamburger in Alaska. It is not much more than the price of a hamburger now, maybe a double cheeseburger. That is ridiculous when you consider a 200-year- old tree of that magnificence being given away to both domestic and foreign-owned corporations up there in the Tongas National Forest. Six, are there any nonmonetary reciprocal obligations that should be demanded of special interests that receive government benefits? For example, if we are going to give $50 billion bailouts in 1989 and $50 billion in 1990 to the S&L crooks and speculators, why don't we require the S&Ls to put in their monthly bank statement an insert--at no expense to themselves and paid for by consumers--that would invite consumers to form their own financial consumer association and monitor their own banks on the corner of Elm Street and Main Street in Columbus, Ohio, or some other place so that this never happens again? In short, if the government's going to bail out an industry due to the industry's culpability, negligence, overreaching corruption, speculation, it should empower the customers of that industry, like utility consumers or bank consumers, with a simple insert that costs the taxpayer nothing, is voluntary for the consumers to join, so they can form their own private watchdog group with their own annual dues and their own operated organization. You might be interested to know that this proposal was made to the House Banking Committee in 1989 and 1990, each year that it had a bill subsidizing the bailout. We got six votes out of over 40 or so in the House Banking Committee for this concept, something that cost the taxpayer nothing, is voluntary to consumers and would clearly deter any repeat of this horrible commercial boondoggle that cost the taxpayers billions of dollars all the way to the year 2020. And then finally is there an institutional means of periodic review of the program to ensure that subsidy programs, if they are going to be allowed to continue, continue to serve their broader public purpose? Does the program require reauthorization by Congress or will it have automatic renewal? The central question to ask is what are the procedural and substantive avenues for citizen challenge of the program, whatever subsidy program, to restrain unauthorized, unbridled government misbehavior in these areas? This is a classic series by Time Magazine late last year on what corporate welfare costs the average American by Donald Bartlett and James Steele. I am told that this is one of the most sought after issues of Time Magazine on the stands, and it got enormous letters of approval by people who read this series, and I will submit this for the record as well. I might also note, Mr. Chairman, that the area of remedies here in my testimony are detailed, and they are put there for discussion. They are put there for discussion, debate, and I would just like to quickly summarize them. One would be a bill to eliminate all corporate welfare and make them start all over again. Remember zero-based budgeting? You just eliminate all corporate welfare and say to the mining companies, come to Congress, mining companies, and tell us why you should get hard rock minerals on the Federal lands free of charge from the U.S. Government, which is the trustee for taxpayers for these minerals. Then there should be citizen standing to sue, to challenge corporate welfare abuse. How many people realize that the citizens are completely shut out from using the courts to challenge executive branch abuses in corporate welfare, including alleged illegal positions by the government or looting of the U.S. Government, say, by oil companies who year after year underpay their royalties on the Federal lands where oil is being explored? How about small funding for town meetings on corporate welfare all over the country to inform the public of this vast area of power play allocation of their tax dollars? What about sunsetting corporate welfare and basically giving them a term of office. You know, $300 a month welfare mothers are now under a 5-years-and-you-are-out requirement, but corporate welfare kings don't have to adhere to any 5-years-and-out requirement. What about annual agency reports on corporate welfare? Make these agencies list every program so Congress can have data and information on which to proceed with its analysis. Why not list every corporate beneficiary of these subsidies above a certain diminished threshold and publish this on the Internet? By the way, Mr. Chairman, the Internet needs to be much more focused on by the Congress. All the voting records of Members of Congress should be on the Internet, and unfortunately, that is not the case. What about a Securities and Exchange Commission requirement for corporate welfare disclosure? The SEC law could be amended to require publicly traded companies to list the subsidies both by type and amount they receive from governmental bodies and to publish this information on the Internet. What about limits on multimillion dollar annual executive compensation in government subsidized or sponsored corporations? What about prohibiting government subsidies to criminal corporations, corporations which are adjudicated to engage in criminal price fixing, like Archer-Daniels-Midland has been on the lysine scandal? What about reciprocal obligations, where the government gets something in return from the corporate welfare beneficiaries? What about government properties, real or intangible, that should be presumptively sold, leased, or rented at market rates? What about promoting competition in the allocation government resources? What about competitive bidding for exclusive rights to taxpayer assets where exclusivity has been determined to be appropriate? What about reasonable pricing provisions for that Taxol drug and for that woman with ovarian cancer and for the taxpayers who have to pay at both ends to develop the drug and to pay for Medicaid? What about ending fossil fuel and nuclear power research and development subsidies and letting energy conversation and renewable energy operate on a level playing field? What about a presumption against discount insurance which often gets to market risky technology? What about paybacks for bailouts? What about preventing foreseeable financial bailouts with amendment to H.R. 10, which I might add Senator D'Amato asked us to submit when we testified on that legislation. This is an amendment, which I included in my testimony on the back page, that would prevent any bailouts of these giant financial conglomerates that H.R. 10 would facilitate. We drafted this with great specificity, Mr. Chairman, and then it fell on deaf ears in the Senate. What about eliminating all corporate tax expenditures or requiring regional and national compacts, et cetera? Mr. Chairman, the time is now for you and other courageous Members of Congress, who truly believe in ending corporate welfare as we know it, to launch a series of General Accounting Office, Congressional Research Service and Congressional Budget Office studies and conduct extensive hearings in Washington, DC, and across the country to introduce and vigorously push for corporate welfare legislation and, by your leadership, to force this issue with such broad appeal to many liberals and conservatives, to small taxpayers and small businesses all over the country on to the front pages and the nation's television screens. There is a nascent, national consumer-taxpayer- environmental-worker-small business coalition waiting to be consolidated on this issue. It is an issue that sometimes divides progressives from liberals and conservatives from corporatists. But it is an issue which unites many people who have never been united before to form a powerful political force that can help rescue our political democracy from the narrow interests that now dominate. Given its breadth, this testimony necessarily paints in broad strokes. It has unassailable rhetoric, as well as deep and irrebuttable evidence, but it is important to reiterate that we do not oppose all corporate welfare. It is important that even good corporate welfare programs operate with safeguards in place to ensure procedural fairness, full disclosure of beneficiaries, frequent congressional review, citizen standing to challenge in the courts and reciprocal payments, as well as nonmonetary commitments from recipients. You know, during the energy crisis, we didn't want to be dependent on foreign oil. It may have been valid to have corporate welfare programs to facilitate energy efficiency or solar energy. This hearing, Mr. Chairman, is an important and historic beginning, but if it is not followed up by more hearings and a sustained effort that involves more and more Members of Congress and citizen organizations, it will be of modest consequence. It is our obligation, Mr. Chairman, to support your courageous position here and those of your colleagues and to support it day after day; and to help expand the opportunity presented by this public hearing, where Congress is at its best in educating the people about very important issues that are not just economic or not just taxpayer, but deal in many areas from the environmental to the level playing fields we would like our economy to adhere to. So bring on the corporate welfare kings to testify before your committee, and the excitement will be such that it may even make the Geraldo Show and other television shows that thus far have somehow, in their sadomasochist proclivities, ignored the subject of corporate welfare. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Ralph Nader follows:] Prepared Statement of Ralph Nader, Consumer Advocate Chairman Kasich and members of the House Budget Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the vast subject of corporate welfare. Today's hearing is long overdue. A significant percentage of the business of Washington, DC, revolves around corporate welfare--with lobbyists, trade associations and business executives lobbying to obtain or protect special, favorable treatment from the Federal Government--but curiously, notwithstanding our efforts since 1970, there has never been a Congressional hearing devoted to a comprehensive assessment of the issue. Government agencies and research offices have conducted only a handful of Joint Economic Committee-type studies in recent decades which tried just to inventory the long list of mechanisms by which the government distributes tax revenues and other public assets to private business. Mr. Chairman, you deserve major credit for issuing a clarion call for Congressional attention to corporate welfare, and for leading various legislative efforts over the years to end egregious corporate welfare programs that benefit narrow business interests at the expense of the taxpayer, and often, one should add, at the expense of other important concerns, such as environmental protection, economic competition, fair consumer prices, national security, job creation and a well-functioning democracy. As you know well, Mr. Chairman, the myriad of corporate welfare programs generally do not persist on the merits. Rather, they remain entrenched and continue to grow because strong and well-organized business interests, with huge monetary concerns at stake, aggressively work to defend and expand them--often hand in hand with powerful Members of Congress with whom they maintain mutually advantageous relationships. Cleaning the corporate welfare slate will not be easy. There is only one change that will counteract the entrenched interests which create, shield and rationalize corporate welfare programs: an informed and mobilized citizenry. Absent organized and focused public outrage, legislative efforts will yield minimal success as compared to the overall scale of the corporate welfare budget. To make this claim is not to belittle such efforts. Legislative initiatives directed toward particular programs and abuses can achieve reforms that are important in their own right, and legislative proposals can and should be part of the very process of generating citizen interest and focused attention. But innovative legislative proposals will not, by themselves, be sufficient to create an informed public opinion that translates into the action needed to create a countervailing force to the business lobby for corporate entitlements. Many steps will be needed to create that countervailing force, but one very important step will be a series of high-profile Congressional hearings that shine the light on egregious corporate welfare abuses, develop an analytic framework to assess corporate welfare programs, develop procedures and hone proposals to eliminate or control corporate welfare programs, bring the Corporate Welfare Kings (beneficiary CEOs) before Congressional committees to justify their dependence on the public dole, generate news media stories and investigations, and elevate the visibility of the issue in policy debates within the Beltway and around the country in town hall meetings. This hearing should begin that process. We hope it will be followed in coming months and years by more detailed inquiries. In this testimony, after preliminary remarks on the evolution of corporate welfare and on defining corporate welfare, I will offer a rudimentary corporate welfare classification scheme and highlight particular examples of each category. (The categories offered: government giveaways; government-funded research and development; bailouts; tax expenditures; government-sponsored enterprises; loans and loan guarantees; state and local corporate welfare; export and overseas marketing assistance; defense, transportation and other pork; loans and loan guarantees; and grants and direct subsidies.) In addition to fleshing out the typology, the discussion of examples will be intended to offer insights into the following questions:What rationales do private interests use to secure subsidies from the government, and then to shield them from challenge, from either the legislative and judicial branches? How do corporate welfare programs become entrenched and immune to cessation or reform? To what extent do foreign corporations benefit from the expenditure of U.S. taxpayer dollars on corporate welfare? How can fair pricing mechanisms be used to allow beneficial programs to be preserved, while eliminating welfare subsidy components? What criteria should be used to determine when corporate welfare programs should simply be cancelled, and when they should be restructured to extract public benefits, pay-backs or investment returns from the government-supported enterprise? What administrative due process should apply to corporate welfare? How can taxpayers be given standing and procedural rights under the Administrative Procedures Act and other relevant statutes to challenge arbitrary agency action in the corporate welfare area? How do economic subsidies disadvantage nonsubsidized competing businesses, who pay their dues, and foster undesirable market outcomes? At the conclusion of my testimony, I will suggest, for discussion purposes, reforms to rein in the proliferation of corporate welfare programs. These will not be in the form of a target list of programs that should be cancelled (though there are certainly many of these, and several highlighted here). Rather the proposals are overarching approaches, elements of a comprehensive approach to corporate welfare. Defining and Scrutinizing Corporate Welfare ``Corporate welfare'' is a general term in need of definition before it can become the basis of legislative action. Many have offered a working definition that looks to the benefits conferred and costs incurred by a particular program, subsidy or loophole. In these definitions, if a program is considered corporate welfare if its public cost outweighs its public benefits. Others have asked whether the private, corporate benefit outweighs the overall public benefit. These are important questions--questions which should be asked of any corporate welfare program--but they are too narrow to serve as the basis for defining corporate welfare. Defining corporate welfare in this fashion also immediately orients the debate about any particular program into a contest over the program's merits, with defenders of the program inevitably explaining how it creates jobs and therefore is worthy of taxpayer support. A more robust definition of corporate welfare looks not to the benefits conferred on the public, but to the benefits conferred on corporations as compared to any corporate payment, or goods or services provided, to the government. If a program involves the government giving more to private companies than it gets back--that is, where it is engaging in a transaction that cannot be justified as a fair market value exchange--then it should be considered corporate welfare. No definition of corporate welfare will be all-inclusive--some element of know-it-when-I-see-it will have to remain, including for pork-laden contracts for unnecessary goods or services--but applied flexibly, this definition should serve well. The advantage of this definition is that it suggests analytic inquiries other than whether a program is ``good'' or ``bad.'' It allows for the possibility of ``good'' corporate welfare--programs that confer subsidies on business but are merited because of the overall public gain. (As I will reiterate, I believe there are cases of ``good'' corporate welfare--but these too should be subjected to proper procedural and substantive checks.) In deferring the debate over a program's merits, this definition of corporate welfare channels discussion so that a series of inquisitive screens can be applied to the program, including but not limited to whether the program should be cancelled. Among the screens that should be applied: 1. Does the program serve some broad public purpose that suggests it has merits beyond the benefits it confers on particular companies? If not, the program should be cancelled. 2. If it does serve some public interest, can the government achieve the same ends or more important public goals by retaining an interest in an asset being given away or doing a service in-house? 3. Does the program involve functions that should properly be left to the market? 4. If the government is going to distribute assets or contracts or tax breaks to private parties, can and should it do so in a nonexclusive way so that competition is promoted? 5. If the government is going to provide corporations with services, or give away its assets, is there any reason it should not charge, or should charge below-market rates? 6. Are there nonmonetary reciprocal obligations that should be demanded of special interests that receive government benefits? These might include, but not be limited to, reasonable pricing of government- subsidized goods and services sold to consumers. 7. Is the program subject to constitutional or other judicial challenge as a waste of taxpayer assets, or use of taxpayer assets for corporate welfare, rather than the general welfare? Does the program exceed the implementing agency's statutory authority? What are the procedural and substantive avenues for citizen challenge of the program to restrain unauthorized agency action? 8. Is there an institutional means of periodic review of the program to ensure it continues to serve its broader public purposes? Are criteria delineated by which the program should be evaluated? Does the program require reauthorization or will it have automatic renewal? These queries should be applied in public and Congressional debate, but they should also adopted in comprehensive legislation, as suggested in the suggested discussion of proposals at the end of this testimony. The Evolution of Corporate Welfare Corporate welfare is probably as old as the corporate form, and runs through all U.S. history. The Crown Corporations such as the Jamestown Company and the Massachusetts Bay Company that colonized America were given exclusive rights to exploit designated territories. While a vigorous tradition of skepticism of corporate power characterized early America, corporations were frequently able to translate political power into economic benefits from the states. In Ohio, for example, the state legislature passed the Ohio Loan Law in 1837--disparaged by citizens as the Plunder Law--which required the State to give tax revenues to private canal, turnpike and railroad corporations while permitting them also to charge tolls. Ohio, like other states, passed ``special legislation'' to confer benefits on particular companies. Government land giveaways without what we would now call fair- pricing requirements helped the railroads gain a monopolistic stranglehold over farmers in the West, spurring the Populist Movement. Special deals between the Federal Government and J.P. Morgan and a coterie of financiers conferred huge profits on Wall Street interest at the turn of the century. Through corruption and the exercise of political power, utilities and trolley systems extracted subsidies and special deals from local and state governments in numerous forms through the first decades of this century. Following the Federal Government expansion of the New Deal and World War II eras, the enlarged Federal budget and enhanced Federal authority offered new opportunities for giveaways and corporate handouts. Defense and nuclear power companies, perhaps more than any others, latched on to the corporate welfare bandwagon and never let go. Other corporate interests found opportunities in the urban renewal efforts of the 1950's and 1960's, which often benefited developers and construction interests at the expense of low-income communities. And elaborate tax dodges came into vogue. The bailouts of Lockheed and Chrysler in the 1970's narrowed still further the separation between government and business, and paved the way for the sharp upsurge in corporate welfare of the last two decades. The Reagan-Bush years perhaps marked the beginning of what could be called the corporate state, characterized by an expanding array of welfare benefits for big business as well as a host of other privileges and immunities. That condition continues to prevail today. The public is widely disenchanted with the corporate welfare budget, especially in the era following the sharp limitations placed on welfare for poor people in 1995. Now is a time when the corporate welfare tide can be turned, if Members of Congress are prepared to focus the spotlight on corporate welfare programs and beneficiaries, to call the Corporate Welfare Kings to account, and to rally around the public around a pro-taxpayer, pro-competition, pro-environment, pro- consumer, pro-worker, anti-corporate welfare agenda. Giveaways The U.S. Federal Government is quite probably the richest property owner on earth. The government owns vast tracts of land, including oil and mineral riches, forests, thousands of buildings and plants, the public airwaves and much more. Because they often do not appear as budgetary debit items, government giveaways too frequently escape the corporate welfare stigma. Giveaways are in fact one of the purest forms of corporate welfare--a something-for-nothing, or something-for-too-little, proposition. The level of public outrage would be high if the government wrote a $70 billion check to the broadcast industry--but that is effectively what happened when the Federal Communications Commission, pursuant to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, handed over the digital television spectrum to existing broadcasters. The government retains its property as the shared commonwealth of the people of the United States, and there should be a strong presumption against giving it away. Where a reasoned decision is made to distribute some of that wealth to private parties, the government should explore whether it can distribute the public assets in a nonexclusive, public-purpose way, or in a fashion that promotes competition. When public assets are going to be distributed to private parties, there should be a strong presumption that the government should receive a market-rate purchase or lease price; and where taxpayer assets are to be distributed to a narrow class of beneficiaries, below-market purchase or rental rates should be accepted only in the most compelling of circumstances. Finally, prior to transfer or government property to private parties, the government should consider whether there are nonmonetary reciprocal obligations that should be demanded of recipients--these may include everything ranging from binding promises to adhere to higher environmental standards to contributing equipment to support noncommercial television. With stealth government giveaways of public assets, such as the internet naming rights discussed below, accelerating, there is an urgent need for the adoption of procedural and substantive protections to prevent the looting of the commonwealth. Digital Spectrum Giveaway In one of the single biggest giveaways in U.S. corporate welfare history, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on April 7, 1997 donated broadcast licenses for digital television to existing broadcasters. Under the terms of the giveaway, the broadcasters will pay nothing for the exclusive right to use the public airwaves, even though the FCC itself estimated the value of the digital licenses to be worth $11 billion to $70 billion. The giveaway was mandated, in part, by the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which prohibited, under demands by the broadcaster lobby, the FCC from auctioning off the airwaves. The Telecommunications Act also required the FCC, if it decided to allocate the licenses, to give them only to incumbent broadcasters. The licenses will permit the broadcasters to air programs through digital signals, which offer higher picture quality than currently used analog broadcasting. FCC rules will require broadcasters in the largest cities to air digital programs in the next few years. All of the broadcasters will continue to air analog versions of their programs, at least during a dozen-year transition period. The new licenses are for the spectrum equivalent of five or six digital television channels. The broadcasters will be able to use the extra channels to air multiple simultaneous programs or, more likely, for other purposes, potentially including data transfer, subscription video, interactive materials, audio signals and other not-yet-developed innovations. In these enterprises, they will compete at advantage with noncorporate-welfare receiving companies. The original theory behind granting the broadcasters such wide spectrum space was to permit them to air high-definition television (HDTV). But many broadcasters may choose not to air HDTV, and instead will receive the extra spectrum channel space as a super-windfall- yielding a no-license-fee revenue stream from nonbroadcasting uses of the spectrum, in addition to revenues from no-license fee airing of digital television broadcasts. As former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole has recognized, there is no conceivable reason why the incumbent broadcasters should have been given exclusive rights to use the airwaves. Other possible television broadcasters should have been given the right to bid for portions of the digital spectrum, and so should have other potential users, such as data transmission companies. These competing business interests' protestations were completely trumped by the power of the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), however. This is the quintessential perversion of democracy: the broadcasters pay nothing to the public for the right to air programming over the public airwaves; then they use the influence they gain over politicians from their use of these public resources to extort still greater subsidies; and all the while they do not allow this subject to be covered on their news programs. Only a few weeks after consummating their tremendous coup at the FCC, the broadcasters expressed sudden concern with the fate of viewers who would be forced, in 12 years time, to buy new televisions if the broadcasters forfeit their analog stations, as currently scheduled. This would indeed be an extraordinary consumer shakedown, but not one that the broadcasters are positioned to challenge in good faith. They are now lobbying to maintain their analog stations--another public resource which they exploit free of charge. The FCC estimates the value of the analog spectrum at as high as $132 billion. Lost in the giveaway was the opportunity to set aside portions of the broadcast spectrum for public access, educational and public interest programming. However, a new opportunity is presented by the as-yet-unspecified public interest obligations of the broadcasters, which could be defined to include public interest and public access programming. As part of their public interest obligations, the broadcasters should be required to allocate a substantial portion of their new spectrum space and time to public access programming, and to fund quality programming. Specially chartered, democratically governed citizen television networks could develop programming, or moderately funded programming opportunities could be allocated to qualifying civic organizations. Such a modest dose of media democracy can only be good for our nation's democracy. Others have suggested additional requirements that should be imposed on the broadcasters as public interest obligations. People for Better TV, a national coalition including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Civil Rights Forum on Communications Policy, the Communications Workers of America, the Consumer Federation of America, the league of United Latin American Citizens, the NAACP, the National Council of Churches and the National Organization for Women, is calling for a debate over and analysis of serious proposals to ensure that broadcasters devote meaningful coverage to public affairs, that the broadcasters respect and nurture rather than exploit children, and that measures are taken to promote racial, ethnic and gender diversity in television programming. However, as People for Better TV points out, the Gore Commission which was charged with considering how to define the broadcasters' public interest obligations--remember, again, these obligations are the only payment the broadcasters will make for controlling now $200 billion in taxpayer airwaves assets--failed to rise to the occasion. (The Los Angeles Times derided the report as a 'anational scandal.'') Moreover, although the print media devoted some attention to the issue, as People for Better TV notes, ``Television stations, perhaps fearing regulation, kept the issue off the local and national news. The discussion about how TV stations will (or will not) serve their community is taking place in the same back-room, deal-making, back- slapping environment that always preoccupies official Washington.'' ``The spectrum giveaway and the secrecy surrounding this important debate are travesties of American democracy,'' the coalition rightly concludes. The 1872 Mining Act No discussion of government giveaways can fail to take note of the absurd Mining Act of 1872. The Act--which recently celebrated its 125th giveaway anniversary!--is the subject of regular reform efforts. The reason is simple: the Act allows companies to purchase Federal land for $5 an acre or less and to mine valuable minerals from Federal land without paying a cent in royalties. Whatever the merits of the Act at the time of passage, when it was intended to help settle the West, it has long been clear that the Act serves an unjustifiable giveaway to narrow corporate interests, including foreign corporations. As Carl Mayer and George Riley note in their history of the 1872 Mining Act, ``Many of the deficiencies noted three of 4 years after the law's passage have been cited repeatedly by committees and legislators during the last century. The critics have focused on four problems: the failure of the law to return appropriate revenue to the Treasury; the inability of the Federal Government to halt fraudulent acquisition of mineral land; the loss of government control of patented land which passes out of public ownership; and the elevation of mining to the highest use of the land.'' But reform efforts regularly fail, thanks to mining lobby interests--a lobby with power vastly disproportionate to its economic contributions, which are estimated at about one-tenth of 1 percent of the West's total income. Many of the mines on Federal or patented land are literally billion-dollar giveaways--often to foreign companies. In 1994, American Barrick Corporation, a Canadian company, patented nearly 2,000 acres of public land in Nevada that contained over $10 billion in recoverable gold reserves. Taxpayers received less than $10,000. In 1995, a Danish company patented land in Idaho containing more than $1 billion in minerals for a price of $275. The Mineral Policy Center estimates that mining companies extract $2 billion to $3 billion in minerals from public lands every year-- royalty free. From 1872 to 1993, mining companies took more than $230 billion out of the Federal lands, royalty free, according to the Mineral Policy Center. In 1994, Congress imposed a moratorium on patenting, but already filed patents continue to be filed, and mining companies continue to work already claimed lands. Third World countries routinely strike better deals with mining companies than does the most powerful government on the planet. A mere 8 percent royalty on existing mines would bring $200 million a year into the Federal coffers. The subsidized mines interfere with other economic and noneconomic uses and values of public lands. University of Montana Professor Thomas Power has developed cogent arguments that the destruction of the natural environment associated with mining on Federal lands imposes real economic costs, absorbed both by the tourism industry and residents whose land values and basic decisions to live in the West are based in part on the high quality living environment of the region. The Mineral Policy Center estimates direct cleanup costs for the more than half million abandoned mines on Federal lands in the $30 billion to $70 billion range. In March 1999, the Clinton administration ruled that it would enforce environmental laws that limit the ability of mining companies to dump waste on public lands, and thereby limit the extent to which hardrock mining can be done. The mining industry has set fast to work to repeal this ruling, through a rider to the Interior Appropriations bill or other mechanisms. Congressional enactment of a repeal would be a wholly unjustified degradation of the environment and environmental law. For well over a century, Congress has been more than generous enough to the mining industry. Internet Giveaways An evolving giveaway of public assets involves the management of the U.S. government's internet assets. The Federal Government currently contracts with Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI), to manage certain domain name registrations. After entering into the contract in 1993, NSI was later acquired by SAIC for $3.9 million, and subsequently was permitted to charge U.S. consumers wildly excessive fees for registering internet domain names. NSI's monopoly on the .com and other valuable domain names has turned a tiny initial investment into a firm with a market capitalization of $2.5 billion--thanks to control of the power to sell the public the right to use their own domain names. At no time did the government seek any competitive bids to determine the prices that consumers and business should pay for domain name registrations. As public resentment over the high prices and poor service have grown, the government is now trying to find ways to introduce competition. But NSI is using its monopoly profits to lobby the Congress and the executive branch to maintain its monopoly. As the Administration seeks to replace the current NSI monopoly with something new, it is using its earlier mistakes as a rationale for a new government giveaway that could create an entirely new set of governance problems for the public. Currently the Administration is negotiating a transfer of the ``A DNS root server'' to ICANN, a private nonprofit organization. The new nonprofit organization seeks the authority to impose fees on all internet domain names, to set international policy on trademarks and other issues, and to launch an undefined set of policy initiatives that it will fund from fees assessed on domain registrations. This new initiative raises a number of questions regarding its lack of accountability, and it is justified largely on the basis that the NSI monopoly needs to be ``fixed.'' But it is hard to see how the creation of a new unaccountable body constitutes a ``fix.'' Government Research and Development The Federal Government invests tens of billions of dollars annually in research and development (R&D), most prominently through the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy and the Department of Health and Human Services. These investments lead to new inventions and the award of thousands of patents--publicly financed, and frequently publicly owned intellectual property. Since the early 1980's, the government has routinely given away the fruits of the research it sponsors, granting private corporations exclusive, royalty-free rights to commercialize government-financed inventions while failing to include and/or enforce reasonable pricing requirements in the licenses. The result: a corporate welfare bonanza for biotech, computer, aerospace, pharmaceutical and other firms. In the critical area of pharmaceuticals, for example, this research giveaway policy leads to superprofiteering by giant drug manufacturers, who charge unconscionably high prices for important medicines--costing consumers, and often resulting in the denial of treatments to consumers who are unable to pay high prices. In an irony that must keep the staff of the Pharmaceutical Researchers and Manufacturers Association in stiches, perhaps the largest ripped-off consumer is the Federal Government--the same Federal Government that paid for the drugs' invention--which must pay extravagant fees through the Veterans' Administration and Medicaid (although the government-brokered prices are lower than those paid by individuals). It wasn't always so. Following the creation of a major Federal role in research sponsorship in World War II, the Justice Department concluded in 1947 that ``where patentable inventions are made in the course of performing a Government-financed contract for research and development, the public interest requires that all rights to such inventions be assigned to the Government and not left to the private ownership of the contactor.'' The Justice Department recommended also that ``as a basic policy all Government-owned inventions should be made fully, freely and unconditionally available to the public without charge, by public dedication or by royalty-free, nonexclusive licensing.'' The Justice Department offered what remains a compelling case for nonexclusive licensing: ``Public control will assure free and equal availability of the inventions to American industry and science; will eliminate any competitive advantage to the contractor chosen to perform the research work; will avoid undue concentration of economic power in the hands of a few large corporations; will tend to increase and diversify available research facilities within the United States to the advantage of the Government and of the national economy; and will thus strengthen our American system of free, competitive enterprise.'' Even in 1947, the Justice Department position was not the uniform standpoint of the Federal Government. The Defense Department consistently maintained a policy of allowing contractors to gain title to government-sponsored inventions, so long as the Pentagon was able to maintain a royalty-free right to use the invention. In the ensuing decades, government policy evolved unevenly between different agencies, with some gradual increase in exclusive rights transfers to private parties. The various agency policies favoring exclusive licensing were done without Congressional authorization. Seven Members of Congress and Public Citizen filed suit in 1974 against the disposition of government property without Congressional authorization, but the case was dismissed procedurally on lack of standing grounds. Beginning in the mid-1970's, however, big business, in collaboration with partners at major research universities, began lobbying for a major transformation in government patent policy. Based on highly questionable evidence, the business-university alliance argued that exclusive licensing was necessary to spur private sector innovation and development of government-funded inventions. The concerted business-university campaign succeeded in 1980 with passage of the Bayh-Dole Act, which transferred exclusive control over many government-sponsored inventions to universities and small business contractors. Universities were in turn permitted to exclusively license to private corporations, including big businesses. It is important to note that the Bayh-Dole Act was contentious at the time of passage. Other alternatives proposed at the time included a suggestion by Admiral Hyman Rickover that government inventions be licensed nonexclusively for a period of 6 months; and that if no party had indicated an interest in commercialization, that the patent then be open to competitive bidding for an exclusive license. A proposal by President Carter, which passed the House of Representatives prior to passage of the Bayh-Dole Act, would have limited the exclusive license granted by government to designated ``fields of use.'' But presented with the Bayh-Dole Act, President Carter signed it. In 1983, President Reagan issued a Presidential Memorandum which instructed executive agencies to grant exclusive inventions to contractors of all sizes. Again, another critical phase in the path of wholesale giveaway of government inventions occurred as the result of unilateral executive action, without Congressional authorization. In 1986, Congress passed the Federal Technology Transfer Act, which authorized Federal laboratories to enter into exclusive contracts with corporations to develop and market inventions originating in the Federal labs. The Federal labs have enormous discretion in working out exclusive licensing arrangements and, without even the universities' interest in earning some reasonable royalty, the labs have effectively given away hugely profitable taxpayer-financed inventions with no public return either in the form of royalties or, more importantly, meaningful restraints on company pricing. The Taxol Case Consider the case of taxol, a leading anti-cancer drug. In January 1991, the National Cancer Institute licensed taxol to Bristol-Myers Squibb. In the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), NCI agreed to abandon its model ``reasonable pricing'' language. Instead, it used the following: ``NCI has a concern that there be a reasonable relationship between the pricing of Taxol, the public investment in Taxol research and development, and the health and safety needs of the public. Bristol- Myers Squibb acknowledges that concern, and agrees that these factors will be taken into account in establishing a fair market price for Taxol.'' This exhortatory phrasing did not exactly place NCI in a position to discipline Bristol-Myers Squibb's pricing of the drug. Following a bizarre negotiation to set a reasonable price, Bristol- Myers Squibb markets Taxol at a wholesale price that is nearly 20 times its manufacturing cost. A single injection of Taxol can cost patients considerably more than $2,000--and treatment requires multiple injections. That the contractual language was so weak is all the more remarkable because of the extraordinarily minor contribution that the company made to the development of the drug, although BMS would of course claim it has done important collateral research. NCI discovered, manufactured and tested Taxol in humans. BMS's only contribution to the New Drug Application (NDA) to the Food and Drug Administration was to provide 17 kilograms of Taxol to NCI and to process paperwork. The value of the 17 kilograms was probably less than $5 million. Bristol- Myers did not pay any fee to NCI in entering into the CRADA, and it does not pay royalties to the U.S. government on its billion dollar annual sales revenue from Taxol. Bristol-Myers Squibb maintains exclusive rights over Taxol due to its control over the health registration data (clinical trial data used for regulatory approval of pharmaceutical drugs), which it gained as a result of the CRADA. The company does not have a patent on the drug, because it was invented by Federal researchers. Bristol-Myers Squibb is now leading a major effort--in the United States and around the world-- to extend the period during which it maintains exclusive control over the data submitted to receive FDA approval. A National Economic Research Associates study found the consumer cost of an additional 2 years of Bristol-Myers market exclusivity for Taxol will be $1.27 billion, including $288 million paid by Medicare. Some of those without insurance are simply unable to afford the drug. The cost of preventing generic competition throughout much of the rest of the world is to deny most patients access to the medicine altogether. Though particularly stark, the Taxol case is not unique. Because the Federal Government is responsible for the resources leading to the invention of a very high percentage of the most important new drugs, especially anti-cancer drugs, the problem of government licensing is frequently posed. This is a consumer issue of the highest order of significance. Where the government hands an annual billion-dollar revenue earner to a private company for a pittance, is it too much to ask the relevant Federal agency to enforce reasonable pricing requirements? Might an avenue of citizen challenge to the terms of the NIH-Bristol-Myers Squibb deal have changed the terms of the contract, saving consumers millions of dollars and perhaps saving lives? The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) is a public/private partnership between seven Federal agencies and 20 Federal laboratories, and the big three automakers--General Motors, Ford and what is now Daimler Chrysler. According to the Department of Commerce, the PNGV ``aims to strengthen America's competitiveness by developing technologies for a new generation of vehicles.'' The program was announced on September 29, 1993 by President Clinton, Vice President Gore and the CEOs of the domestic auto makers. PNGV's main long term goal is to develop a ``Supercar,'' which is described as ``an environmentally friendly car with up to triple the fuel efficiency of today's midsize cars--without sacrificing affordability, performance, or safety.'' This could also be described as an effort to coordinate the transfer of property rights for federally funded research and development to the automotive industry. The agencies involved include NIST, DOD (US Army Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center and the Advanced Research Projects Agency), DOE (various national laboratories), DOT (NHTSA, the Research and Special Projects Administration, FHA and Federal Transit Administration), EPA (the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory), NASA and NSF. It is hard to imagine an industry less in need of government support for research than the highly capitalized auto industry, which is reporting record profits year after year. The government is supporting research that the industry would or should do on its own in response to market demands, or could easily be required to do in order to meet tougher environmental standards. The program also poses the issue of the terms under which patents and other taxpayer-funded intellectual property are transferred to Ford, Chrysler, General Motors and other large firms. This poses the same problems of monopolistic or oligopolistic control over government- funded research as the biomedical research example, and, if any part of the program is deemed worthy of preservation, similar calls for remedies of nonexclusive licenses. The PNGV program is clouded by secrecy, with negotiations over these and other important issues undertaken in secret, with no public comment. The structure of the PNGV program creates special anti-competitive problems. The program gives participants an effective exemption from antitrust laws, even though competition in research and development is more likely to yield innovation than bureaucratized collaborative arrangements such as the PNGV initiative. History provides a clear warning against such arrangements. In the 1960's, the Justice Department filed suit against the automakers for product fixing--for refusing to introduce air quality enhancing technologies. It is instructive to review excerpts from the complaint in the case. It alleged that the U.S. automakers and their trade association had conspired ``(a) to eliminate all competition among themselves in the research, development, manufacture and installation of motor vehicle air pollution control equipment; and (b) to eliminate competition in the purchase of patents and patent rights from other parties covering motor vehicle air pollution control equipment.'' The auto companies subsequently signed a consent decree that stipulated they would not engage in collusive behavior among themselves and their trade association. The Reagan administration released the car makers from the consent decree; and now the Clinton administration, acting as if the collusive history never occurred and was not known, has waived antitrust laws and assisted the automakers in resuming noncompetitive research and development. Today, the PNGV initiative is serving as a smokescreen behind which the automakers hide to protect themselves from more stringent air quality standards. (Exacerbating the problem, the Green Scissors Coalition points out, is the fact that the Department of Energy's expenditures on diesel vehicles directs funding into a highly polluting technology.) Deployment of existing technologies could dramatically enhance auto fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but the automakers choose not to make these technologies widely available. Notably, the PNGV program itself does not require the deployment in mass production of the technologies it seeks to develop. The leading innovators in fuel efficiency have been Toyota and Honda, which notably do not participate in the PNGV program. Progress from the PNGV participants only seems to come in response to new announcements from nonparticipants--again illustrating the importance of competition. Why should the government waive antitrust laws and pay the highly profitable auto industry to collude on research that it could and should undertake on its own? What is the rationale for failing to extract guarantees that newly developed technologies will be deployed? Where are the procedural mechanisms to allow citizens to challenge this government-authorized and -funded corporate-welfare collusion? What are the paybacks to taxpayers for this program? Six years have gone into the program, and there is nothing to show for such taxpayer largesse. Solutions The PNGV is not the only example of a Federal research program that should be eliminated. Research and development programs in areas like fossil fuel (among them the clean coal technology program, and the Department of Energy's coal and petroleum R&D programs) and nuclear power (the Nuclear Energy Research Initiative) invest funds in support of highly capitalized industries to promote undesirable nonrenewable technologies. Such programs are not defensible. More interesting questions arise in areas where the government is legitimately involved in the research and development sphere, such as in biomedical research. There are several potential ways to resolve the giveaway problem embedded in current policy. One is to revitalize the Rickover proposal of immediate nonexclusive licensing, followed by the possibility of exclusive licensing if no party accepts a nonexclusive license. This arrangement would guarantee competition and keep prices down. If exclusive licensing proves necessary, in a Rickover-style scheme or otherwise, the license should be granted on the basis of an auction. The auction should consider factors such as: the strongest guarantees of low price marketing of the final product, buyer commitment to invest profits in research and development, and royalties to the government. The weight attached to these factors should perhaps vary according to the type of invention. For example, in the case of pharmaceuticals, reasonable pricing should take priority over royalty returns to the government. Federal agencies should be able to adopt these policies on their own, but the recent history of cozy relationships between manufacturers, universities and Federal laboratories has led Federal agencies and universities alike to cut sweetheart deals that boost corporate profits while punishing consumers and failing to recoup government investments. Congressional action is needed, and citizens should be guaranteed procedural opportunities to challenge sweetheart arrangements that do not comport with statutory requirements. Bailouts The modern corporate bailout period began with the 1974 Lockheed bailout, escalated with the 1979 Chrysler bailout and soared with the gigantic savings-and-loan bailouts of the late 1980's and early 1990's. These bailouts, of course, are generally doled out to large corporations and industries. When a family-owned restaurant fails, no government intervenes to stop it from going belly up. If a small factory can't pay its bills, it goes out of business. The bailout, a premier form of corporate welfare, is typically yet another market distortion against the interests of small and medium-sized businesses. Bailouts are different from other corporate welfare categories in that they are ad hoc and unplanned. There is no ongoing government bailout program to be cancelled or reformed. But there are lessons to draw from recent bailout experience that should inform Congressional action now and in the future. First is the issue of payback. In the case of the Chrysler bailout, the Federal Government received warrants and ultimately earned a profit on its loans. In the case of the S&Ls, a special levy was assessed against the industry to pay some of the costs--although the overwhelming majority of the cost was borne by the taxpayers. If Congress determines in any particular case that a company or industry bailout is necessary, it should prioritize the issue of payback-- assuring that, after the company or industry is nursed back to health, our government is paid in full, or as close to full as possible. Second, monetary payback is not enough. Remember, by definition in a bailout context, the government is stepping in because private financial markets are not willing to invest in or make loans to the troubled corporate entity or entities. That is why the government is stepping in. And especially because the government is doing more than making a market-justified loan, it has a right to make additional nonmonetary demands, particularly demands designed to prevent the need for future bailouts. In the case of the S&L bailout, consumer groups repeatedly urged Congress to require depository institutions, as a condition of the bailout, to carry notices in their monthly balance statements. These notices would have invited consumers to join democratically run, nonprofit, nonpartisan consumer groups that would advocate for their interests and provide an institutionalized scrutiny of S&Ls, banks and other depository institutions. These organizations would have been privately funded, voluntary and statewide. They would have operated at no cost to the taxpayer or to corporations, because their mail inserts (paid for by the consumer group) would have used the ``extra'' portion of the billing envelope, adding no postage costs to the S&Ls. These financial consumer groups would have functioned as an institutionalized early warning system, ringing alarm bells over emerging problems before they reached crisis phase. They remain a vital proposal for depository institutions, as does the proposal more generally for other industries and companies. At minimum, some variant of this proposal should be attached to every bailout, and where applicable, as in the case of the digital TV spectrum, to giveaways also. Third, the S&L crisis was triggered in large part by industry deregulation, specifically the Reagan administration's decision to permit S&Ls to raise interest rates and to leave their area of competence (lending for housing) and venture into other uncharted, riskier waters. And it was caused, to some considerable extent, by S&L criminal activity. This experience should be an important cautionary note for corporate welfare opponents: deregulation, underregulation and nonregulation pave the way for bailouts, especially in the financial sector. Thus Congressional corporate welfare opponents should be looking very carefully, for example, at the nonregulated world of hedge funds, and not be satisfied with Treasury-proposed disclosure regulations. The perceived need for Federal Reserve intervention in the case of Long-Term Capital Management, and the possibility that losses to the firm could have been much more severe, highlights the potentially serious bailout possibilities that might be faced in the near future, absent newly imposed regulations. Finally, the danger of creating too-big-to-fail institutions should make corporate welfare opponents advocates of strong antitrust policy (and a significantly enlarged budget for antitrust enforcement agencies), and supporters of existing restraints on the concentration of economic power. Thus, corporate welfare opponents should be leading opponents of HR 10, that would erase the line, established by the Glass-Steagall Act and the Bank Holding Company Act, which prevents common ownership of banks, insurance companies and securities firms. If HR 10 or some variant is enacted, the subsequent mergers in the financial industry will exacerbate the too-big-to-fail syndrome. The concern would be that permitting, say, an insurance company to fail would endanger the health of its conglomerate parent, which would in turn threaten a crisis of the entire financial sector, including taxpayer-insured banks. HR 10 would also function to effectively extend the Federal safety net to nonbank affiliates of federally insured banks. If a bank with a failing insurance affiliate makes bad loans in order bail out the insurance company, and then itself faces financial trouble as a result, Federal deposit insurance will be there to back up the bank. That insurance comes cheap. In 1995, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) stopped collecting deposit insurance premiums from banks. Today, all banks, except for a handful of the most risk-prone, receive free insurance from the Federal Government. As a result, the bank insurance fund at FDIC has only about $32 billion on hand to cover all contingencies for 8,983 commercial banks with nearly $3 trillion of deposits. And should FDIC come up short when banks fail in an economic downturn, it can turn to the U.S. treasury. In 1991, with the bank insurance fund in the red, Congress voted to establish a $30 billion contingency fund at the Treasury Department to be used in the event that FDIC ran out of deposit insurance money. An additional, urgent note on the S&L looters: they're back. A Federal judge in California has ruled that Congress broke the government's contract with Glendale Federal Bank when capital based on goodwill was outlawed in the 1989 savings and loan reform legislation. The court awarded the corporations $908.9 million. There are some 125 suits pending with claims similar to those of Glendale. If the Glendale case is a precedent, the government could lose another $30 billion on top of the nearly $500 billion in principal and interest that has already been obligated in the S&L bailout, with some of the new corporate welfare benefits conferred, as the New York Times has pointed out, on some of the more notorious figures in the savings and loan debacle, including some who are serving prison terms. The 1989 reform legislation properly insisted that failed institutions be closed and that remaining S&Ls have adequate capital--actual capital, not the fake capital represented by something as vague as goodwill (albeit the ethereal capital which the bank regulators had agreed to recognize). The Glendale case presents two problems. One is how vigorously the Clinton administration Justice Department is contesting the Glendale line of cases. This question is a matter for Congressional investigation, and I have asked Banking Committee Chairman Leach to hold hearings on this and related issues. The second issue is how the Glendale claims will be paid, if in fact courts hold that they must be. The New York Times reports that a provision was inserted into last fall's omnibus appropriations bill--without hearings or open debate, in yet another example of how corporate welfare giveaways are bound up with anti-democratic procedures--that was designed to allay fears of lobbyists that the Treasury Department might refuse to pay or that the industry might end up being saddled with the costs through a special assessment. This provision must be repealed, and it should be promptly replaced with legislation that assesses the special fee the industry opposes. The 1989 reform effort, including the implementation of strict capital rules and the elimination of worthless imitation capital like goodwill restored confidence in the savings and loan industry, and this has been a sizeable government benefit, courtesy of the taxpayers, to the entire financial industry and its shareholders, and particularly to the thrift sector. It would be wrong for the taxpayers, who have borne the brunt of the savings and loan bailout, to now be required to pay the judgments of these goodwill suits. A final note on bailouts: The normal course for a company that cannot pay its bills is not to turn to the government, but to enter into Chapter 11, temporary bankruptcy. Since the 1979 reforms to the bankruptcy laws, large corporations have increasingly used bankruptcy as a refuge from large civil liability claims. A.H. Robins, Johns Manville, Union Carbide and Dow Corning are among the companies which have followed this route, and Big Tobacco has waved the threat of bankruptcy to strengthen its bargaining position in lawsuits and in the legislative process. These companies have manipulated the bankruptcy code to force victims of dangerous products or dangerous production processes to absorb some substantial portion of the costs of their injuries and to separate future income streams from liability. This manipulation is particularly outrageous because it involves not financial creditors who misassessed the viability of a bankrupt company's operation, but innocent victims of corporate violence. There is, in the process, no government transfer to private corporations, but it is the law which permits these companies to victimize consumers twice, first by injuring them and secondly by denying them adequate compensation through the bankruptcy ploy. As this Congress debates bankruptcy law revisions to crack down on the largely illusory problem of citizens abusing the bankruptcy process, it should instead direct its attention to corporate bankruptcy abuse, and reform the bankruptcy laws to eliminate this callous form of corporate welfare. The recent U.S. Supreme Court decision in Fibreboard should work to diminish corporations' ability to abuse bankruptcy procedures, but legislative revisions are needed as well. Corporate Tax Expenditures Federal corporate tax expenditures--special exclusions, exemptions, deductions, credits, deferrals or tax rates--totaled more than $76 billion in fiscal year 1999, according to conservative estimates by the Office of Management and Budget. For the 5-year period 2000-2004, the government will spend more than $394 billion on corporate tax subsidies. The notion of tax ``expenditure'' expresses the idea that revenue losses due to preferential tax provisions such as special exclusions, exemptions, deductions, credits, deferrals or tax rates have the same budgetary implication as a giveaway of government resources. When the government does not collect certain taxes due to tax expenditures, it is spending money. And when the government fails to collect taxes from corporations due to various legal preferences, it is subsidizing those companies as surely as if it were making direct payments to them. The issue here is not tax rates, but tax preferences for particular categories of corporations or corporate behavior. The crusade against corporate welfare cannot exclude corporate tax expenditures any more than it can exclude direct government subsidies to corporations. The special insidiousness of corporate tax expenditures is that they are hidden subsidies. They do not appear as budget expenditures, and because they represent money not collected (rather than payments doled out) they do not generate even the felt-outrage of off-budget giveaways. Generally, once they have been included in the Internal Revenue Code, corporate tax expenditures remain on the books unless Congress affirmatively acts to remove them. This situation contrasts to on-budget programs, which require continuing Congressional approval and authorizations to continue, and therefore are automatically subject to ongoing Congressional review, if not action. The 1974 Budget Act requires that a list of tax expenditures, corporate and individual, be included in the budget. This budgetary requirement at least makes it possible to identify the cost of most corporate tax expenditures, and it is a model for what should be done in other corporate welfare areas, a point to which I return later. Many of the corporate tax breaks merit special attention because they actually encourage undesirable activity, including environmentally destructive activity. The oil and gas industry, for example, wins major subsidies through the tax code. When the need to encourage a transition to renewable fuels is clear, why does the Internal Revenue Code encourage more aggressive oil drilling, with its associated environmental harms, than even market demand would induce? What rationale is there for artificially biasing the market against conservation and efficiency? Tax escapes and credits to the oil and gas industry take more than $500 million from taxpayers annually. Similarly, several tax rules encourage wanton mining, beyond that which is justified even on market terms, by providing tax incentives for mining operations. The effect is to bias the market against recycling interests. The percentage depletion allowance for mining allows mining companies to deduct a certain percentage from their gross income that exceed the actual loss of value. (These vary by mineral, with sulphur, uranium and lead given the high percentage of 22 percent.) Rules that allow immediate expensing of exploration and development, rather than a write-off as mines are depleted, plus other mining tax escapes, cost the Treasury an estimated $300 million a year. The origin of many of the corporate tax loopholes is the stuff of Washington legend. It represents one of the worst distortions of our political democracy. Well-heeled lobbyists, who spin through the revolving door between government and K Street and represent high-donor corporate interests, facilitate backroom deals that save their clients millions (or billions). The taxpayers, of course, lose commensurate amounts. To take one recent egregious example, a conference committee, reportedly acting in response to instructions from then-Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, inserted a tax break-- not included in the previous House or Senate versions--in the 1997 tax bill that provided special benefits for Amway Corporation and a few others. The tax break came a few months after Amway founder Richard De Vos and his wife Helen De Vos each gave half million dollar soft money contributions to the Republican National Committee. The revision to Internal Revenue Code Section 1123 applies to two Amway affiliates and four other companies, and will cost taxpayers $19 million over 10 years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Because the Section 1123 revision was so narrowly targeted, it is possible to infer the strong likelihood of the cause-and-effect relationship between the contributions and the tax benefit. It is also possible to directly identify one of the main beneficiaries. The Amway case is typical in the shady fashion in which it transpired. It is somewhat unusual to be able to identify key beneficiaries. This example highlights why, as important as the reporting requirement of the 1974 Budget Act is, much more disclosure is required in the area of corporate tax expenditures. One critical issue is: which companies are benefiting from corporate tax expenditures? OMB should be required to compile a list of the top 50 beneficiaries of each corporate tax expenditure. A second critical issue involves the intended effect of each tax expenditure. Aside from serving as payoffs to politically well- connected companies, tax expenditures are designed to encouraged specific kinds of behavior. Do they do so? For example, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit is designed to encourage firms to hire certain groups of people (such as recent welfare or food stamp recipients) for low-skilled jobs. The FY 1999 cost of this corporate tax expenditure is $285 million. But it may be that the tax credit also provides an incentive for churning of these employees, so that employers can repeatedly recoup the tax incentive. (Employers can claim a credit of up to $2,400 for the first $6,000 of a workers earnings; workers must be employed for at least 400 hours for the credit to be claimed.) The tax credit may also provide an incentive for employers to replace existing employees with new employees from the targeted groups. Determining whether or not these unintended and undesirable outcomes occur requires more data gathering and close Congressional scrutiny. And because of the nature of tax expenditures--they are effectively ``administered'' by the IRS rather than agencies with expertise in the relevant field-scrutiny will come from Congress, or not at all. One way to facilitate that scrutiny is to have sunset provisions for corporate tax expenditures (as for other corporate welfare programs), which would require Congressional renewal of tax breaks. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit is indeed scheduled to be phased out by 2004, but an unproven tax expenditure of this sort should have a shorter first life, say 2 years. At the least, a short initial period for tax expenditures would allow testing and review of whether they achieved their desired effects, and whether they had any harmful consequences. Generally, and without regard to the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, such a standard seems particularly appropriate given the harsh time limitations applied to welfare for poor people in the 1996 ``welfare reforms.'a Another area deserving of immediate and priority Congressional investigation is the apparent underpayment of Federal income tax by foreign corporations. A recent GAO report concluded that foreign- controlled corporations doing business in the United States pay approximately half the taxes that U.S. companies pay. The report found that the approximately 15,000 large U.S. companies paid an average of $8.1 million in Federal income taxes in 1995. The approximately 2,700 large foreign-controlled in the United States paid an average of $4.2 million in 1995. Foreign-controlled companies paid taxes as a percentage of sales at just over half the rate of U.S. companies. Senator Byron Dorgan and Citizens for Tax Justice attribute the differential payments in large part to manipulative transfer pricing by foreign multinationals--this practice of dubious legality involves paying too little or charging too much in paper transactions between U.S. and foreign affiliates, so that the income of the U.S. affiliate is artificially lowered. Citizens for Tax Justice points out that the growing number of foreign corporate takeovers of U.S. companies (Daimler's purchase of Chrysler, Deutche Bank's takeover of Bankers Trust and BP's buyout of Amoco and possibly Arco prominent among them) may accentuate the tax avoidance problem. If a legal form of tax avoidance, transfer pricing constitutes a form of corporate welfare. If an illegal tax evasion, then it constitutes a form of corporate wrongdoing outside of the welfare arena, still in need of elimination. A second, growing source of multinational tax avoidance, according to Citizens for Tax Justice, involves financial transactions. In one, newly invented shell game, companies pay interest to nontaxable offshore subsidiaries and deduct the interest payments against their worldwide taxable income. But they claim an exemption from U.S. anti- tax haven laws by contending that, for U.S. tax purposes, the interest earned by the offshore subsidiaries does not exist. The Treasury Department has tried to clamp down on this tax-avoidance scheme, but has been blocked by Congress. Because so many corporate tax expenditures have been identified in official administration and congressional publications, this is a large area in which it would be easy for Congress to act to eliminate a huge category of corporate welfare in one fell swoop. Congress should take prompt action in this regard. But because it is almost inevitable that corporate tax expenditures would return to the Code, it is vital also that Congress enact procedural reforms to control future corporate tax expenditures, with reporting of top beneficiaries and sunset provisions atop the list. Insurance Schemes, Formal and De Facto One of the overriding trends in corporate welfare in recent decades has been the socialization of risk. In making risky investments--some socially desirable, some not--and sometimes undertaking reckless activities, investors are attracted to the prospect of high returns on investment. But corporations are increasingly brazen about foisting the risk of failure--the very reason for high returns--on taxpayers and consumers. The drive to socialize risk while privatizing profit is evident in the corporate drive for tort deform, the tobacco companies' effort in recent years to limit their civil liability, and in the vital importance that business attaches to government insurance schemes, formal and de facto. Among these are: the International Monetary Fund, the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) and the insurance scheme of the Price Anderson Act. Given the existence of a thriving private insurance market, there should be some skepticism attached to claims of necessity of any public insurance scheme. Certainly, there are cases where public insurance programs, voluntary or involuntary, may be merited. Where there is a public interest in guaranteeing industry survival and stability, for example, public insurance schemes may be sound public policy, especially where there is a likelihood of government bailout in the event of major industry liability or failure. But even in these cases, there should be a strong presumption of full-cost recovery and the imposition of reciprocal obligations from the insured, upon whom significant benefits (e.g., public confidence) are conferred by public insurance. Where there is a viable alternative private market, and no clear public interest in industry protection, hard questions should be asked about the appropriateness of public insurance: What is the need for a public insurance alternative in such situations? Does the government do more than provide a subsidized service? Does the government serve as an insurer of last resort--and if so, is this a beneficial public policy or one that merely provides an additional welfare support to other insurers? What public interest is served by government involvement in this area of insurance provision? Does it encourage imprudent investments and actions? Why should the government charge less than market rates for the insurance it provides? Is it a lead in to later government bailouts, as has been the case with banks? The IMF and the ESF The IMF is an international financial agency, located in Washington, DC, that helps debtor countries overcome balance of payments deficits. It makes loans to countries, conditioned on those countries adopting a policy package known as ``structural adjustment.'' In recent years, the IMF has expanded its traditional function to function as a de facto insurer of the global financial system, making massive loans to countries that suffer from sudden withdrawals of international capital. The Exchange Stabilization Fund is an off-budget account controlled by the Secretary of Treasury. Congress established it to enable the Secretary to defend the dollar in the event it lost an excessive amount of its value relative to other leading currencies. In recent years, the Secretary has made very large draws on the ESF to fund U.S. participation in bailouts of countries that are suffering from financial meltdowns. The vast shifts in international financial capital which have characterized the global financial markets in the last decade have resulted in episodic crises when currency traders, operating in herd- like fashion, suddenly act to pull money out of an economy. These are typically national economies in which there has been a recent, prior infusion of foreign capital in a speculative frenzy. In the last 5 years, the most severe of these crises have occurred in Mexico, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia. In simple terms, the selloff of a country's currency forces its devaluation, making it relatively more expensive to pay debts owed in foreign currencies, and leaving the country with massive debt payment obligations that it is unable to meet. When individuals are unable to pay their debts, of course, typically the debtor and the creditor share the pain. Through bankruptcy or otherwise, a process of work-out occurs, with the creditors receiving less than full repayment. This equitably distributes responsibility for overborrowing to the debtor and to the creditor for imprudent lending. No such thing happens in international financial markets. When countries are suddenly unable to meet their payment obligations, the IMF rushes in. It provides money to the borrower, often in packages which include large contributions from the ESF. This money is used to repay creditors, letting them off the hook. The pain is borne exclusively by the borrowing country, which must accept recessionary austerity conditions (including tax increases, harsh budget cuts and government layoffs) from the IMF as a condition for the bailout of its private creditors. Of course, the story varies from bailout to bailout, but this is the essential process. In 1995, the Clinton administration orchestrated a nearly $50 billion bailout of the Wall Street interests which stood to lose billions with the Mexican peso devaluation. The centerpiece of the bailout was $20 billion in currency swaps, loans and loan guarantees from the ESF. The IMF (in which the U.S. maintains an 18 percent share) contributed almost $18 billion to the bailout. Not all of the $50 billion was used, and what was used was paid back, but that does not affect the character of the administration's action as providing after- the-fact insurance. The peso devaluation was necessitated by Mexico's chronic balance of payments deficit, but the severity of the devaluation and subsequent crisis stemmed from the Mexican government's long maintenance of an overvalued peso. Fully aware of the peso's overvaluation, foreign lenders and short-term investors continued to flock to the Mexican market because of its high, 18 percent interest rates. When the inevitable devaluation occurred, investors pulled out en masse. Rather than letting Wall Street accept responsibility for irresponsible lending, the Clinton administration, with the help of the IMF, orchestrated the bailout. This massive commitment of taxpayer funds, it should be noted, came without Congressional approval. Instead, to forestall Congressional objections, the administration sought and received the acquiescence of then-Speaker Newt Gingrich and then-Majority Leader Dole. The Mexico crisis repeated itself in Asia in 1997. Foreign investors and lenders poured money into the Asian tigers to take advantage of very high interest rates and returns, and then withdrew in herdlike fashion when the bubble burst. With South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia unable to pay back foreign loans (which suddenly appeared more expensive following devaluation), the IMF took the lead role in organizing bailouts of creditors and investors. IMF loans injected money into the Asian economies to enable them to pay back their foreign debts. The amounts at stake were not insignificant: U.S. banks' exposure in South Korea was estimated to total more than $10 billion. BankAmerica alone reportedly had more than $3 billion in outstanding loans to South Korean firms, and Citicorp more than $2 billion. The other major U.S. banks with outstanding loans to South Korea included J.P. Morgan, Bankers Trust, the Bank of New York and Chase Manhattan. Instead of eating their losses, the banks which made bad loans in South Korea and elsewhere in Asia received the money owed them, in some cases over modestly extended repayment periods. The IMF/ESF money goes in and goes out. The banks get their money, the countries contract new debts to the IMF and get stuck with the IMF austerity demands. These recessionary structural adjustment demands have had tragic consequences throughout Asia. In South Korea, the unemployment rate has skyrocketed from under 3 percent to approaching 10 percent. In Indonesia, economic contraction has eradicated the income growth of the last three decades, with poverty rates soaring from 11 to 40 percent. There is still more. Among the conditions imposed by the IMF and Rubin on the Asian countries are requirements that they open up their economies further to foreign investors. (These demands relate to foreign ``direct investment'' in factories, agriculture and service operations ranging from tourism to banks, not just ``portfolio'' investment in stocks, bonds and currency.) Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin specifically and successfully pressured South Korea to open up its financial sector. As a result, the very U.S. banks which contributed to South Korea's crisis and received a U.S. taxpayer bailout now stand to buy up lucrative sectors of the South Korean economy. Similar demands have successfully been made in other troubled Asian countries. History repeated itself a few months later, this time as farce, in Russia. Despite a widespread understanding that Russia had fallen into the grips of an unmitigated criminal capitalism, foreign capital poured into the country, at some points seeking to take advantage of interest rates that hit 100 percent. No one could have doubted the risk of lending to Russia. But when the inevitable collapse came, the IMF-- prodded by the Clinton administration--was there with a bailout package. In July, the IMF signed off on a $22 billion bailout. The IMF released $4 billion dollars into the country immediately. That money went to pay back domestic and foreign creditors; with the rest apparently stolen. It served absolutely no purpose but to subsidize the wealthy in and outside of Russia, all of whom had gambled with their investments in an effort to take advantage of the extraordinary interest offered. In August, Russian defaulted on its loans, and the IMF suspended the bailout. Not only is the double subsidy to the Big Banks unjust, it helps perpetuate the very problem it is designed to remedy. When the IMF and the Treasury Department bail out the banks--in effect providing free insurance--it sends a message: ``Don't worry about the downside of your international loans. As long as enough banks get in too deep, we'll rescue you at the end of the day.'' That encourages more reckless bank lending, since the banks can earn high interest on high risk loans without having to absorb losses. While consumers don't benefit from the higher bank profits, they frequently find themselves hit with higher charges when banks suffer losses from reckless lending that are not fully bailed out. IMF policy, and even U.S. administration policy at and to the Fund, is virtually immune to Congressional influence. With strong prodding from the Treasury Department, the IMF has appropriated for itself the role of a public, no-charge insurer of international currency markets. At the same time, a power grab by the Treasury Department has converted the ESF into a similar no-charge insurer for Wall Street, with ESF monies used for bailout purposes that exceed its legislated purpose. These are the regulators of the global financial system, operating without accountability, bailing out financial interests, wreaking havoc on the economies of much of the world's population. Where is the ``market discipline'' that the IMF so desires to see enforced against poor countries? If investors and lenders make high-return investments knowing the high interest rates represent a risk premium, when the risk is realized, why should they then be able to collect on their investments, care of the IMF and ESF? Working out a sensible system of international financial regulation, which avoids Wall Street bailouts and the unfairly punishing of debtor countries is a complicated matter. It is clear, however, that the IMF and the ESF have to be reined in. Indeed, even the Wall Street Journal and Wall Street conservatives such as George Schultz, William Simon and Walter Wriston have suggested the IMF's powers should be restricted or the Fund abolished altogether. That should mean, first, ensuring that the IMF receives no new funding. Having received $90 billion from all nations last year ($18 billion from the United States), the Fund is now seeking funding for its Extended Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and other initiatives, either through an appropriation or through Congressional authorization of IMF gold sales. Congress should deny this funding, instead insisting that IMF gold sales be used only to provide immediate and direct debt cancellation for poor countries. This will provide real relief for poor countries, rather than expand the IMF's power. Second, Congressional authorization should be required for ESF expenditures of larger than $100 million. Representative Bernard Sanders has introduced legislation to require a Congressional vote prior to ESF expenditures over a specified amount. Nuclear Insurance: The Price-Anderson Act The nuclear industry may be the most subsidized in U.S. history. It is completely a product of U.S. government research and development. Having emerged from massive government investments, the nuclear industry has never cut its umbilical cord tie to the government. One critical, ongoing support for the industry is the Price- Anderson Indemnity Act, which limits the liability of the nuclear industry (both plant operators, and suppliers and vendors) in the event of a major nuclear accident. Under Price-Anderson, each utility is required to maintain $200 million in liability insurance per reactor. If claims following an accident exceed that amount, all other nuclear operators are required to pay up to $83.9 million for each reactor they operate. Under the terms of Price-Anderson, neither the owner of a unit which has a major accident nor the entire utility can be held liable for more than these sums. As of August 1998, this system capped insurance coverage for any accident at $9.43 billion. When the Price-Anderson Act was adopted in 1957, at the dawn of the commercial nuclear industry, ``the Act was intended to overcome reluctance to participate [in the transition to private nuclear industry] by the nascent industry worried by the possibility of catastrophic, uninsured claims resulting from a large nuclear accident.'' Leaving aside for the moment the ecological and economic risks which should disqualify continuation of, let alone support for, the nuclear industry, assume that such a rationale was defensible at the time, as the government tried to promote development of an energy source which many believed would be safe, cheap and abundant. But watch how the rationalization perpetuates itself. ``By 1965,'' the NRC reports, ``when the first 10-year extension of the Act was being considered, a handful of nuclear power reactors was coming into operation, and the nuclear industry considered itself on the verge of expanding into large-scale nuclear power generation. Thus, the need for continued operation of the Price-Anderson system for the forthcoming 10 years was believed to be critical for the unrestricted development of nuclear power.'' A decade later, when another extension of the Act was being considered, the industry was more buoyantly optimistic than it ever had been or would be again. ``With dozens of plants in operation or under construction and with hundreds more being contemplated to be in operation by the end of the century,'' the industry urged that the Act be extended rapidly so that ``any uncertainty about extension would not disrupt nuclear power development,'' says the NRC. Now the industry is in decline. There have been no new orders for nuclear plants for the past 25 years, and aging plants are beginning to be shuttered. The original rationale for the Act is no longer plausible. But nothing has changed with respect to Price Anderson. Indeed, the NRC argues, ``Given industry perception of the continuing need for Price-Anderson, and in view of the lack of new orders in plants, the situation is in some respects similar to what it was when Congress saw the need for enactment of the original Price-Anderson Act.'' (In one way, things are worse than they were in 1957: with nuclear plants closing due to aging, safety concerns, inefficiency and license expiration, the Price-Anderson liability cap will progressively decline in future years. If the upper end of nuclear plant closing projections occurs, available insurance funds could shrink to $4.5 billion in 2013. ) The industry has gone through a full life cycle, but somehow it never outgrew the need for a Federal insurance scheme and liability cap. The result has been a massive subsidy to nuclear power companies. Using the NRC's conservative numbers for the upper limit on a worst- case scenario accident and on the probability of such an accident occurring, Professors Jeffrey Dubin and Geoffrey Rothwell estimated the cumulative Price-Anderson subsidy to the nuclear industry through 1988 to be $111 billion in 1985 dollars. This estimate is based on NRC data on the cost of worst-case accidents--data which is conservative because it does not include health effects. If, again, we leave aside the demerits of nuclear power, there could be justification for a Federal scheme to promote risk sharing in a context which poses a (hypothetically) very small chance of an extremely large loss. (It should be emphasized, however, that this is exactly the situation for which the private insurance and reinsurance markets are designed.) But there is no justification for combining such a scheme with an overall liability cap. The $9.4 billion liability is nowhere near sufficient to pay for the human health and property damages that could result from a nuclear meltdown. Nuclear Regulatory Commission studies have estimated costs in a worst-case scenario at more than $300 billion for a single catastrophe. The nuclear industry's real insurance program is not the $9.4 billion scheme of Price-Anderson, but the free insurance provided by the public. In the event of a catastrophic accident, after the $9.4 billion was spent, it is the Federal Government that would inevitably cover the costs--with some costs probably absorbed by victims who have their injuries compounded by inadequate compensation. Price-Anderson is a textbook example of the hybrid insurance- liability cap program that should be prohibited per se. ``Many nuclear suppliers express the view that without Price- Anderson coverage, they would not participate in the nuclear industry,'' reports the NRC. If an industry which has benefited from massive government research and development and other subsidies for more than four decades, and which creates staggering, environmentally dangerous waste disposal problems and poses enormous risks to human health, cannot survive without government support, then it should not survive. The nuclear industry cannot meet the market insurance test and, with substitute energy sources available, it is not needed. The Price Anderson Act expires in 2002. If it is not repealed before then, it should not be renewed. If nuclear facilities close as a result, well, occasionally at least, corporate America should be subjected to its widely touted rigors of a free market. Government Sponsored Enterprises Government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) are stealth recipients of corporate welfare. Instead of cash or Federal tax subsidies, GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac receive their government largesse in the less obvious form of credit enhancements. Thanks to their extensive links to the Federal Government, Fannie and Freddie borrow money in the markets at almost the same rate as the U.S. Treasury, something that no competitor can come close to matching. Like other GSEs, much of the risk of these housing finance enterprises remains with the Federal Government while the profits flow to private shareholders. It is true that the secondary market operations of these GSEs provide an important service by improving access to mortgage credit by home buyers and stabilizing the mortgage market. The GSEs obtain funds from the bond markets and acquire mortgages from local lenders. The process ensures that home buyers can tap into the nation's savings pool for mortgage financing. Could these functions be carried out without government subsidy? Could private corporations--without links to the government and without corporate welfare--perform the same functions? These are questions meriting close Congressional scrutiny. The key to Fannie and Freddie's phenomenal profits and soaring stock values is the financial market's perception that there is an implicit government guarantee behind the obligations of these corporations. There are good reasons for the financial market's belief that the U.S. Treasury and the taxpayers would be the fall guys in the event of a default. Here are some of the GSEs links to the Federal Government: Fannie and Freddie each have a contingency fund of $2.25 billion that can be drawn from the U. S. Treasury. Their securities are government securities for the purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Their securities serve as eligible collateral for Federal Reserve banks' discount loans. The securities are exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The Secretary of the Treasury approves the issues. The Federal Reserve is the fiscal agent for the issues. Their obligations are eligible for unlimited investments by national banks and state bank members of the Federal Reserve as well as by federally insured thrifts. Both Fannie and Freddie are exempt from local and state taxes-- another benefit that clearly falls under the rubric of corporate welfare. (Even when the District of Columbia was struggling on the edge of bankruptcy, Fannie Mae refused to cough up a dollar in lieu of local income taxes) There are varying opinions about how much these links, and resulting savings on borrowings, mean to Fannie and Freddie. Fannie Mae Chairman and CEO Franklin Raines concedes there are ``benefits'' (he prefers the word ``benefits'' to ``subsidies''), but does not assign a dollar figure to the government ties. However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) conducted an extensive study of Fannie and Freddie entitled ``Assessing the Public Costs and Benefits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.'' CBO estimated that the credit enhancement stemming from the government links was at least $6.5 billion in 1995. According to CBO, Fannie and Freddie pass only part of that subsidy on to home buyers--about $4.4 billion--with the remainder of the credit enhancement subsidy pocketed by private shareholders, the corporations' executives and lobbyists. In other words, for every $2 delivered to home buyers, Fannie and Freddie take $l of the subsidy for themselves. CBO estimates that in 1995, about 40 percent of the of the earnings of Fannie and Freddie could be traced to the benefits of their government-sponsored status. These corporations have prospered under their GSE status and credit enhancement subsidies. Fannie Mae's stock appreciated 1,053 percent between 1989 and 1998. Freddie's stock appreciation was even greater, 1,260 percent. Sixteen years ago, Fannie Mae had a market value of $500 million. Today, the corporation is worth $70 billion. In the process, Fannie and Freddie have become the dominant force in the housing finance market. It is obvious that some of the subsidy derived from their GSE status is being used, not for home buyers, but to increase corporate power and control over all facets of the mortgage business. Will this growing duopoly enjoyed by Fannie and Freddie stifle competition by private companies--competition that might reduce costs and encourage innovation in a variety of mortgage products? Not only stockholders, but officials of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are enriched by the subsidy. In 1997, for example, Jim Johnson, Fannie Mae's chairman, received $5,441,232 in salary, bonuses, stock options and other compensation. His predecessor walked away with a whopping severance package worth more than $20 million. Lawrence Small, President and CEO, received salary, bonuses and stock options of $2,948,751 in 1997. Jamie Gorelick, after leaving the Justice Department as Deputy Attorney General in May 1997, was the recipient of $1,850,993 in salary, bonuses and stock options as Vice Chair of Fannie Mae during the last 8 months of the year. She had no previous experience in housing finance. The directors and officers of Fannie and Freddie have long enjoyed lucrative stock options. At the end of 1995, according to the CBO, executive officers and directors of Fannie Mae owned 1.6 million shares of the corporation. In Freddie Mac's case, CBO said executive officers and directors owned 695,000 shares of their corporation. In addition, the compensation agreements with officers of both corporations include generous options on hundreds of thousands of additional shares worth millions of dollars. All of the Government Sponsored Enterprises are huge issuers of debt. Fannie and Freddie along with two other GSEs--the Federal Home Loan Bank System and the Farm Credit System--issued $1.62 trillion of debt during the first quarter of this year. The Federal Home Loan Bank System has been under fire from the Treasury Department for its borrowing practices. The FHLB System has used its ability as a GSE to borrow cheaply and engage in arbitrage by making investments in nonhousing related investments. But the champion of the arbitrage games among the GSEs has to be Farmer Mac, the newest addition to the rank of Government Sponsored Enterprises. The General Accounting Office reports that Farmer Mac holds $1.18 billion of investments unrelated to its agricultural finance mission--or 61 percent of its assets. House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach calls it ``unconscionable'' for a government sponsored enterprise to have more than three-fifths of its assets in nonmission related activities. ``When a governmentally privileged institution, that is established to serve farmers, abuses its status by investing disproportionately in arbitraged financial investments rather than agricultural loans, the Treasury and the Congress have an obligation to review its management practices,'' Mr. Leach says. Chairman Leach is right about Farmer Mac. But Farmer Mac is but one small corner of the GSE story, particularly compared to the mammoth operations like Fannie and Freddie. All of these GSEs enjoy a special status because of their links to the Federal Government--they all enjoy benefits because of the market's perception that the U. S. Treasury and the taxpayers stand behind their obligations--a fail-safe status that leaves the Federal Government with the risk and the shareholders and the GSE executives with the profits. The Congress should undertake a top-to-bottom review of all the Government Sponsored Enterprises. Are these hybrid half government, half private entities needed to meet credit needs? How well do they meet their statutory missions in specific sectors? And how much of their operations are devoted, not to their missions, but to playing the market in outlandish and unneeded arbitrage games? How much of their subsidy is used to benefit consumers, and how much is siphoned into shareholder profits and bloated executive compensation arrangements? Are existing capital standards adequate? Addressing these problems will require confronting the familiar issue of corporate welfare beneficiaries' political influence. Some of the GSE subsidies intended to lower costs for home buyers are being diverted to build political and lobbying power designed to make it difficult, if not impossible, for the Congress to provide (or for the public to demand) proper oversight or regulatory improvements which would protect the public, increase support for affordable housing or ensure open competition in the mortgage market. A report by the Campaign Reform Project reveals that Fannie and Freddie were some of the largest political soft money donors--more than $900,000 in the 1997-1998 election cycle. This is in addition to contributions by key employees. Many of Washington's premier law firms show up on the GSEs' list of lobbyists along with former Members of Congress like Senator Steve Symms, Representative Vin Weber and Representative Tom Downey. The lobbying lists have included Ken Duberstein, former chief of staff to President Reagan, Nicholas Calio, President Bush's Congressional liaison and Michael Boland, former aide to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. State and Local Corporate Welfare State and local corporate welfare is a problem that involves local, county and state governments and government agencies, but it is a national problem, requiring debate, investigation and solutions at the national, as well as state and local, level. It is a national problem because it is predicated on large corporations pitting states against each other in bidding contests that are structurally biased in favor of Big Business. It is also a national problem, at least in part, by dint of the fact that it occurs in almost every state; an attached appendix highlights state and local corporate welfare abuses in state after state. A Congressional initiative to highlight and address the corporate welfare system must direct attention to state and local corporate welfare because of this problem, and also because nothing frames the debate as well as state and local corporate welfare. Debate over Federal corporate welfare tends to focus on Federal programs, rather than the corporate beneficiaries--and that tends to turn corporate welfare debates into policy discussions no different than other policy controversies. Conflicts over state and local corporate welfare inevitably focus on the corporate beneficiaries, which draws the public's attention. The raw character of state and local corporate welfare--the brazen threats to move, the drain on funding for schools and essential state and local services--rightfully raises the public's ire. For strategic as well as substantive reasons, a sustained and detailed focus on state and local corporate welfare can serve as a wedge to break open the entire national corporate welfare budget to public scrutiny and as a visceral issue around which a citizen mobilization on corporate welfare can form. The Toledo Shakedown and Eminent Domain Abuse In Toledo, DaimlerChrysler has brought a frightened and financially strapped city to its knees. Desperate to keep a Jeep plant in the city, Toledo showered a $300 million local, state and Federal subsidy package on the multinational to support company plant expansion plans. The package includes a property exemption for 10 years, transfer of free land, including site preparation, transfer of environmental liability from DaimlerChrysler to the city and assorted other corporate welfare handouts. All of this is offered in exchange for a Jeep facilities expansion plan that is expected to result in a reduction of Jeep jobs from the current 5,600 to 4,900 (DaimlerChrysler's public claim) or 4,200 (the level the company specifies it will try to preserve in an unenforceable provision in its agreement with Toledo) or something much lower (a likely result based on United Auto Worker estimates and recent layoffs at the plant). The Jeep agreement is remarkable, as are many of the special state and local corporate welfare deals, for being so poorly drafted from the city's point of view, so one-sided and tilted in favor of the corporate beneficiary. There is virtually no binding reciprocal obligation on DaimlerChrysler in the agreement--to create jobs, maintain a certain job level or to agree to set wage levels or working conditions. In exchange for no binding commitments and no share of the profits, Toledo has agreed to put up huge sums of money, much of it borrowed. The most outrageous element of Toledo's Jeep deal is that it requires the displacement of a community near the plant. As it turns out from DaimlerChrysler's plans, the company does not even genuinely intend to use the land that the city will transfer to it from 83 homeowners. In its public explanations, Jeep identifies the community's parcel as a potential truck waiting area; but in its map, the area is to be used for landscaping--a truck waiting area is designated for another parcel of land. Nonetheless, what DaimlerChrysler wants, it is apparently eager to take. So, threatening community residents that it would condemn the entire neighborhood, the City offered to buy their homes. Residents first learned they would be thrown out of their homes and their neighborhood bulldozed not from city officials, but from the Blade, Toledo's daily newspaper. We believe the low-ball efforts violated the Federal Uniform Relocation Act, which requires compensation sufficient to enable displaced people to buy comparable homes or establish businesses in similar or better neighborhoods. Many Toledo residents accepted the city's low-ball offer, others held out for somewhat better deals. A handful have resisted. This fiasco replicates Detroit and GM's shameful collaboration in 1980, when the City used eminent domain to eradicate Poletown, a stable community of 400 homeowners, twelve churches and dozens of small businesses, schools and a hospital. In the Poletown case, GM ultimately built a Cadillac factory which created far fewer jobs than advertised and did not require destruction of many homes. Indeed, the Toledo-DaimlerChrysler eminent domain scheme marks what is a growing corporate welfare trend whereby states and localities abuse their eminent domain powers to serve private parties. These are many of the most heart-wrenching instances of corporate welfare, because they often involve the literal destruction of longstanding homes, neighborhoods and communities. This newly emerging trend echoes the shameful corporate welfare history of ruthless use in the 1950's and 1960's of condemnation powers to uproot inner city communities and transfer valuable property to commercial and real estate developers. Corporate Blackmail and the Marriott-Maryland Case While the implied threat of DaimlerChrysler moving loomed in the background of the Toledo dispute (city officials admitted fear of the company fleeing motivated their extraordinary generosity), the threat of corporate flight was in the foreground of Marriott's recent, successful effort to blackmail the state of Maryland into providing a $31 million to $47 million subsidy package. In 1997, the company announced that its Bethesda, Maryland headquarters were no longer large enough to house its expanding workforce of 3,800. It created a search committee to decide where the company's new headquarters should be based. Company CEO Bill Marriott announced that the company would be willing to locate to a new state if compelling financial reasons justified it. Virginia leaped into the bidding war. Virginia Governor James Gilmore III and former Governor George Allen both actively attempted to seduce Marriott to step across the border to take advantage of Virginia's lower tax rates. Faced with Virginia's enticements, and with Marriott's cultivated indecision, Maryland progressively augmented its offer to the company. When Marriott finally announced its intentions to remain in Maryland, state officials celebrated their victory over their neighbors. ``Our team is red-hot, Virginia's team is all shot,'' Maryland House speaker Casper Taylor, told the Washington Post. But in the bidding war Marriott cultivated between Maryland and Virginia, the only winner was Marriott. The corporate welfare package bestowed on Marriott did absolutely nothing to create new jobs. Marriott had already determined that it would expand its headquarters because of its growth and profitability--and that decision was made without regard to whether it would receive tax breaks in the state where it would base its headquarters. After the giveaway, William Skiner, president of the Maryland Taxpayers Association, suggested that companies which receive public money should issue stock to state residents. ``They have my address. Where are my shares?'' he asked. Of course the answer to that entirely reasonable question is: there are none. Nor are there similar subsidies available to small businesses. They do not have the political clout, nor the plausible threat to move out of state, to leverage comparable corporate welfare packages. This imbalance creates a very real competitive advantage for large corporations like Marriott, which use the same state, county and local services as a 20-room inn or other small business, but does not pay a proportionate share of the taxes that fund these services. After the tax subsidy deal was completed, the Baltimore Sun reported that Marriott had decided on remaining in Maryland before the state made its last, more generous offer. According to the Sun's report, Virginia officials were aware of the Marriott decision, but remained silent--enabling the company to extract more money from the state. Playing for All the Money: Stadiums, Gambling and Corporate Welfare Perhaps the most outrageous kind of bidding for business involves sports stadiums. The pattern is now familiar: the local sports team, owed by a megamillionaire in virtually every case except for the publicly owned Green Bay Packers football team, threatens to move unless the city bestows a glamorous, and extraordinarily expensive, publicly financed new stadium on the team. Inevitably, the stadium is required to contain luxury boxes and high-priced seats which help fill the teams coffers, but put watching the local team out of reach for significant portions of the town's population. If the city refuses to capitulate to the team's demands, the team, especially if it is a football team, typically follows through on its threat, and moves to a new location. That creates a lose-lose situation for the city: either lose the team, or spends hundreds of millions of dollars for a public facility that will be used entirely or primarily to support a private sports team. Most, but not all, cities choose to subsidize the team, even in the many cases where scholastic athletics, not to mention the schools themselves, are massively underfunded. In Seattle, Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen even paid for the use of Washington state's electoral machinery to finance a special election to fund a baseball stadium. Pouring millions of dollars into the referendum--against a piddling amount spent by the grassroots opponents of the stadium--Allen was able to eke out a narrow 51-to-49 percent victory. The Allen example follows the typical pattern of stadium proponents outspending opponents in elections by an order of magnitude or more. Other examples of cities that have capitulated to this kind of sports mogul blackmail include Baltimore, Cleveland, Denver, San Diego, Nashville, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Miami, San Francisco, St. Louis and Detroit. Now gambling casinos are looking for similar subsidies. In Detroit, after the city decided to give three giant corporate casino companies an effective license to tax lower-income people by running casinos, it decided to sweeten the offer further by providing $50 million in development funding and using eminent domain to take prime locations for the gambling houses. In Atlantic City, the state of New Jersey is contributing more than $200 million in taxpayer dollars for a road-tunnel project and more than 100 acres of free land to entice Steve Wynn's Mirage Resorts to build yet another casino in the city. Building Steve Wynn's driveway has required the destruction of nine houses in the city's most prosperous African-American neighborhood. (Such tax subsidies, incidentally, are not the only corporate welfare now granted to increasingly politically powerful gambling interests. Public Citizen reports that Senate Majority Leader inserted a provision into the 1998 IRS Reform Bill that permits employers and employees solely in the casino industry to receive 100 percent tax exemptions for employer-provided meals, regardless of whether workers need to eat on the premises to do their jobs properly. This provision is estimated to save the industry approximately $30 million a year.) Corporate Welfare in the Guise of Community Development There is a also an urgent need for public and Congressional scrutiny of a more regularized and pervasive form of corporate welfare, which is commonly described as community development and made available not on a negotiated case-by-case basis, but to all businesses locating in certain areas or meeting certain criteria. By providing a variety of local, state and Federal tax breaks through creative financing mechanisms (including tax increment financing), cities, state and community development agencies seek to assist businesses locating in targeted areas. The economic development agencies administering these programs are, in many cases, sincerely trying to facilitate community development, especially in low-income areas. But there is generally little reciprocal obligation placed upon the beneficiaries, either to provide certain kinds of jobs, or jobs at a living wage, for example. There is also serious reason to question whether some of the investments would have occurred in the absence of the incentive, or whether the tax incentives shift some investments from a nearby area with little net social gain. The UCLA Center for Labor Research and Education and the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy recently conducted one of the most comprehensive reviews of a local community development effort, focused on the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency. This project, it would be fair to say, was favorably disposed to such community development efforts, but was designed to help direct public expenditures to realize higher returns in terms of public benefits. Among the project's findings and recommendations (which apply directly only to the Los Angeles agency but probably apply widely): large subsidies to retail operations did not pay off; there was an underinvestment in industrial relative to retail development; small neighborhood shopping centers represented a better investment than large retail complexes; and that record keeping on the results of subsidized ventures is inadequate and needs improvement. Ending Local and State Corporate Welfare Addressing state and local corporate welfare will obviously require state and local initiatives. But there is an important Federal role, as well. First, Congressional hearings that require some of the Welfare Kings to testify before a Congressional committee and to justify blackmailing cities and states may exercise some deterrent effect on the degree of their bullying. Congressional hearings should also probe whether the provision of tax subsidies and similar incentives distort economic decisionmaking concerning the location of business activity and therefore constitutes an unconstitutional infringement on Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce, as has been suggested by Northeastern University Law Professor Peter Enrich. Second, states need to be authorized and encouraged to enter into compacts in which they refuse to enter a race to the bottom against each other in terms of special tax breaks and related benefits. Congressional legislation should authorize anti-corporate welfare compacts. Third, the Federal Government should levy a surtax on companies receiving state and local tax breaks, at the very least treating the value of the tax breaks as income upon which Federal taxes should be paid. Representative David Minge has introduced legislation toward this end. On the stadium issue in particular, Senator Arlen Specter's proposal to require Major League Baseball and the National Football League to pay half the costs of any new stadium for teams in their leagues represents a useful starting point for determining how to ensure that the private corporate beneficiaries of stadiums pick up at least a significant part of the tab for their construction. Finally, Congress should conduct a review of the use of tax-exempt municipal bonds. Their use to fund corporate welfare, private projects or public projects that will benefit a narrow business interest (classically, a sports team) should be prohibited. (There may also be merit to considering a replacement of the tax exemption with direct Federal transfers to state and local governments--according to Citizens for Tax Justice, such a scheme could transfer more money to state and local governments at less Federal cost, while eliminating one kind of local and state corporate welfare.) All of these proposals should be subjects of future hearings by the House Budget Committee and other relevant Congressional committees, and should be the topic of GAO and CRS reports. Large corporations have become increasingly adept at using their size and mobility to blackmail cities and states. City and state governments need assistance from the Federal Government to save them from cannibalizing their own tax bases. The alternative is to permit large companies to extort more and more welfare subsidies at the expense of taxpayers, small businesses and competing use of local and state monies--such as rebuilding crumbling schools. Export and Overseas Marketing Assistance Various government agencies maintain an array of export assistance programs. These programs raise the question of why overseas marketing and lending and other export assistance should be a government rather than private sector function. As regular beneficiaries of double standards, big business executives and lobbyists, it seems, are without a sense of irony. How do the corporate proponents of international trade agreements designed to promote misnamed ``free trade'' explain their simultaneous support for marketing subsidies? If it is only on the grounds that ``other countries do the same thing,'' perhaps they should turn their multinational lobbying prowess to eliminating other countries' export assistance programs. The most disturbing feature of many of the export assistance programs may be that the assisted companies export troublesome products or technologies--weapons, or environmentally hazardous equipment, for example. Such programs, especially the various private corporate arms exports initiatives supported by the Defense Department, should be ended. Weapons Exports Assistance The United States spends billions in a panoply of programs and agencies to support corporate commercial arms exports, according to the World Policy Institute's William Hartung. The Pentagon maintains a large bureaucracy devoted to promoting sales of military hardware by U.S. corporations to foreign governments. The Defense Department spends millions at military air shows to hawk the arms makers' wares, and it spends billions of dollars on loans, grants, credits and cash payments to enable foreign governments to buy U.S. weapons. Surely there are more efficient ways for the government to invest money if it is only concerned with creating jobs. Of course, weapons are not innocuous products, and there are severe costs to an arms exports policy driven by commercial impulses. Former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias has noted that the defense industry's weapons-pushing destabilizes countries and regions, as with respect to the removal of the ban on the sale of high-tech weapons to Latin America. The repeal of the ban was the direct result of industry lobbying. According to Arias, it ``will certainly impede our efforts to break the vicious cycle of poverty and militarism.'' Commercial weapons exports may also undermine U.S. national security and humanitarian interests. As former Senator Mark Hatfield stated in 1995, ``We can still enumerate dozens of cases where the transfer of U.S. military hardware has resulted in the misuse of those weapons, including human rights abuses and in the conduct of acts of aggression. Even more horrible is the fact that U.S. financed or provided arms have been used against our own soldiers in Haiti, Somalia, Panama and Iraq.'' Why should the Pentagon subsidize commercial arms exports that may end up in the hands of dictators, may end upset regional stability, or which may be used against U.S. soldiers? Other Export Assistance and Overseas Marketing Promotion Programs Other government export programs have been the target of more sustained public and Congressional outrage, which has led to some partial but still inadequate reforms. The Department of Agriculture's Market Access Program, once known as McNuggets for the World for its support of McDonald's advertising (when it was formerly the Market Promotion Program), is a $90 million- a-year program which is now limited to support of marketing efforts by farmer cooperatives and trade associations. However the benign-sounding category of cooperatives, suggestive of small farmer arrangements, includes such operations as Sunkist and Ocean Spray, which are well able to afford their own advertising campaigns. Again, the Market Access Program and similar programs raise difficult questions: Why is export assistance a proper government function? Why does the market fail to provide incentives for advertising, lending or other functions? And if businesses determine that a particular activity is not market- worthy, what public interest is served by the government filling the vacuum? If export assistance from other nations is the primary rationale for U.S. activities, how serious are efforts to negotiate an international agreement to curtail such programs? Finally, does the government receive an adequate return on its investment? Defense and Highway Pork It is important that ``pork''--federal monies for unnecessary projects--is understood as a subset of, not a synonym for, corporate welfare. Indeed, pork is the special case that does not fit in the definition of corporate welfare offered earlier in this testimony. While pork is a significant drain on the Federal treasury, it is not, by and large, a helpful analytic term. Labeling a project ``pork'' stigmatizes it as unnecessary; the response of the project's defenders is to say that in fact the project is necessary. ``Pork'' does not offer objective criteria by which the dispute can be resolved. Nonetheless, while analysts may differ over whether one or another project is pork, almost no one disputes that pork exists and is widespread. Pork is in part a reflection of our regional and state representative system of governance, with legislators trying to return Federal dollars to their districts or states. But it is also derivative of a corrupt political system in which special interests exert an unhealthy influence. Pentagon Pork The Pentagon budget is a bloated source of contractor pork. Without entering into a discussion of U.S. national security imperatives, it is clear from many official reports by both the Congress and the Executive Branch that much of what the Pentagon procures is unnecessary; that Pentagon waste and fraud is persistent; and that these problems reflect the political power of the military contractors. One classic example of unnecessary procurement is the C-130 transport plane, which is built by Lockheed Martin in Georgia, near former Speaker Newt Gingrich's district and in the homestate of former Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn. The Air Force has requested just a small fraction of the more than 250 C-130 transport planes for which Congress has appropriated funds since 1978. The planes cost about $75 million apiece. Systematic corporate contractor fraud and waste have long been, and remain, too widespread at the Pentagon. Most recently, the Department of Defense Inspector General reported on spare parts provided to the Pentagon by Allied Signal at a 57 percent markup over commercial prices. It is important to understand the political underpinnings for ongoing Pentagon welfare and the failure to crack down on waste, because it illustrates the importance of competition and economic decentralization in curbing corporate welfare, and because it presents a case where outrageous corporate welfare benefits helped consolidate the political influence of narrow business interests. During the early years of the Clinton presidency, the Pentagon encouraged the defense sector to consolidate, and it backed up its encouragement by subsidizing mergers through payments to cover the costs of consolidation--including extravagant ``golden parachute'' bonuses to executives of acquired companies. No industry knows how to respond to corporate welfare subsidies like the defense industry, in part because they conceive and lobby for them, as did Norman Augustine, the now retired CEO of Martin Marietta. The result of the Pentagon's encouragement is that military suppliers have undergone an ear- splitting consolidation that has left but three major prime contractors: Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Raytheon. Today's Lockheed Martin is the product of the merger of Lockheed, Martin Marietta, Loral, parts of General Dynamics and about two dozen other companies. Boeing leaped to the top tier of the contractor pack with its acquisition of McDonnell Douglas. Raytheon gobbled up Hughes. With manufacturing facilities spread across the United States, these three companies now have enormous political influence--they can show that new military contracts will mean jobs in the districts of hundreds of Members of Congress, and in nearly every state. For districts where they do not have facilities, they can employ suppliers to help give them a political presence. This structural power, which is supplemented by major investments in campaign contributions and lobbyists, helps enable the contractors to preserve the cycle of wasteful spending and abuse at the Pentagon. The tight consolidation of the industry also leaves the Pentagon much less able to deploy one of its most powerful sanctions against contractor wrongdoers--procurement disbarment--because of the paucity of alternative prime suppliers. Highway Pork The Federal highway bills are another major source of pork. While important progress has been made in directing highway monies to road and bridge repair, as well as for modes of public transport, last year's highway bill, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) will allocate billions of dollars to new road construction, much of it unnecessary and harmful. Instead of supporting modern mass transportation, Congress continues to satisfy road construction interests (and indirectly the auto companies). The harmful consequences include sprawl, air pollution and contributions to global warming. Other Forms of Corporate Welfare: Loans and Loan Guarantees As anyone who has been bombarded with credit card solicitations knows, there is no credit shortage in the United States. So why does the U.S. government enter into the business of making loans and issuing loan guarantees to large corporations? Corporations generally want loans from the government either because the loans are made at below- market rates, or because the loans include some sort of implicit subsidy (including de facto government insurance). This is a form of credit allocation that some legislators decry when applied to ordinary Americans. Consider a loan on the verge of being approved by the World Bank, in which the United States is the largest country shareholder with an approximate 16 percent share. The $180 million loan package would help finance an oil pipeline that would transgress Chad and Cameroon, in Central Africa. The three corporate beneficiaries of the loans would be Exxon, Shell and the French company Elf. The three companies' consortium says that it plans to use the World Bank financing as the foundation for additional private financing. In other words, private lenders will be more willing to support the project knowing that the power of the World Bank stands behind compelling repayment. But if three of the world's largest oil companies do not feel comfortable financing an oil development scheme on their own, or if they are unable to attract private financing without government or multilateral lending agency support, perhaps that is a sign that the project should not go forward. (Critics point out that the project poses threats to rainforests, endangered-gorilla-inhabited conservation areas and drinking water; and is likely to exacerbate ethnic conflicts with consequences potentially similar to those in Nigeria's Niger Delta or worse--political violence, some connected to prospective oil revenues, is already rife in Chad. ) Loans and loan guarantees are another corporate welfare category deserving a high degree of skepticism. For healthy companies, these kinds of government supports should be unnecessary. For cases where a political decision has been made that special circumstances merit some company or industry receiving loans or loan guarantees, Congress should adopt legislation that establishes a presumption of full repayment, at market rates. (For comment on bailout loans, see the remarks above.) Agricultural Subsidies The government maintains a variety of agricultural subsidies, ranging from irrigation subsidies to crop insurance and price supports for certain commodities. Many of these benefits accrue to corporate agribusiness, and often support environmentally harmful farm practices (such as overuse of water). The original purpose of farm supports was to support family farmers and enhance stability in agricultural markets, and it is doubtful whether the programs still fill this function. At the same time, many farm supports were eliminated in the 1996 Farm Bill, with the general effect of promoting agribusiness consolidation and increased power for grain traders. Food prices have not declined. All of this suggests the need for a serious and open- minded reassessment of farm programs, so that the public interest in protecting family farms and sustainable agriculture is advanced, while subsidies for large agribusiness are curtailed. Conclusion With corporate welfare so pervasive at all levels of government and so deeply entrenched thanks to the political maneuvering of beneficiary corporations and allied bureaucracies and legislators, the campaign against corporate welfare must be strategically savvy, multi-pronged and able to both create momentum and to take advantage of external events. Nurturing this kind of agility requires a broad legislative agenda, with numerous bills introduced to accomplish different ends. After all, the looting of Uncle Sam is an ever-growing Big Business. Corporate welfare opponents in Congress should look to introduce: simple, bold and far-reaching legislation to galvanize public support; legislation that empowers citizens to mobilize in opposition to corporate welfare; proposals that guarantee procedural fairness in decisions to provide and continue corporate welfare benefits; legislation that requires ongoing review of corporate welfare programs; proposals that emphasize the obligations of the corporate beneficiaries of government largesse to pay back the taxpayers in monetary and nonmonetary terms; disclosure-oriented requirements to present taxpayers with the costs and beneficiaries of corporate subsidies; and narrow and precise bills that address particular corporate welfare abuses and which may be valuable later as amendments or to capitalize on suddenly potent issues. These are matters calling for creative thinking and approaches not only from Members of Congress, but from law schools, political scientists and economists. Unfortunately, a survey of law reviews and recent Ph.D. dissertations that we made reveals a remarkable paucity of academic attention to the issue of corporate welfare. And few philanthropic foundations are interested in funding research into the issues. But more attention from Congress and the public will help jar academia awake. For now, here is a beginning set of overlapping proposals for discussion and reform. This list focuses on structural approaches, rather than itemizing programs that should be eliminated. The first set of proposals applies generally to corporate welfare, with the second oriented around the categorization of corporate welfare benefits offered in this testimony. In the spirit of trying to spark a flexible, pluri-centered campaign against corporate welfare, some of the proposals are redundant--different approaches may appeal to different Members, and different proposals may fit different political moments. In the same spirit, these proposals are intended to be provocative and are certainly open to criticism and refinement. Their purpose is to jumpstart creative thinking and debate about procedural and substantive remedies to an expanding corporate welfare claim on taxpayer monies and assets. Across-the-Board Approaches 1. A Bill to Eliminate All Corporate Welfare. A simple bill that would wipe the corporate welfare slate clean could provide a valuable rallying tool for citizen opponents of corporate welfare. Such legislation would not propose a permanent ban on corporate welfare, which in any case would always be vulnerable to subsequent legislative action, but would require proponents of particular programs to mobilize support for the affirmative re-commencement of their favored subsidies under both procedural safeguards and reciprocal obligations. Then the advocates of the 1872 Mining Act could make their case for why such an abomination should be reinstated after elimination. The central operative language for such a bill might read: (1) As of January 1, 2000, every Federal agency shall terminate all below-market-rate sales, leasing or rental arrangements with corporate beneficiaries, including of real and intangible property; shall cease making any below-market-rate loans or issuing any below-market-rate loan guarantees to corporations; shall terminate all export assistance or marketing promotion for corporations; shall cease providing any below-market-rate insurance; shall terminate all fossil fuel or nuclear power research and development efforts; shall eliminate all liability caps; and shall terminate any direct grant, below-market-value technology transfer or subsidy of any kind. (2) As of January 1, 2000, the Internal Revenue Code is amended to eliminate all corporate tax expenditures listed in the President's annual budget. (3) As of January 1, 2000, the Internal Revenue Code is amended so that the value of local, county and state tax subsidies to corporations shall be treated as income. (4) Where contractual arrangements or promises made in law preclude any action required by Sections (1), (2) or (3) without payment by the Federal Government to existing beneficiaries of programs to be eliminated, Federal agencies shall take such actions as soon as possible without incurring such payment obligations. Because of the complexity of the corporate welfare problem, such legislation would obviously need to incorporate considerable language amending existing statutory language. And even this approach would leave some corporate welfare problems unaddressed--such as the need to eliminate pork-laden or other programs in which the government should not be engaged, or for nonmonetary commitments from corporations receiving government supports)--but it would be a very useful start. 2. Citizen Standing to Sue to Challenge Corporate Welfare Abuses. Citizens could be empowered to mount judicial challenges to runaway agencies that reach beyond their statutory powers to dole out corporate welfare. Legislation could give taxpayers standing to file such suits, by awarding a $1,000 ``bounty'' (plus reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) for those who successfully challenge improper agency action. Consideration should be given to creating an incentive for such suits by awarding successful plaintiffs a percentage of the money saved through such suits, perhaps according to a sliding scale of declining percentage returns for higher savings and with a cap set at certain amount. Just as qui tam suits under the False Claims Act have helped curtail oil company underpayment of royalties owed the Federal Government, so such a measure would create a structural counterbalance to corporate influence over Federal agencies. 3. Funding for Town Meetings on Corporate Welfare. A small appropriation could fund dozens of town meetings across the country on corporate welfare and help educate the public about corporate welfare. Alternatively, the House and Senate Budget Committees should use their committee resources to schedule a smaller number of public hearings on corporate welfare across the country. 4. Sunsetting Corporate Welfare. The Congress should consider legislation requiring that every program in which the government confers below-market-value benefits on corporations, including tax expenditures, automatically phases out in 4 years after initial adoption, and every 5 years thereafter. Under such a rule, the programs could of course be renewed, but only with affirmative Congressional action. Sunsetting would overcome the problem of inertia by which both bad ideas and good ideas turned bad become entrenched corporate welfare programs protected from serious legislative review and challenge. The entrenchment problem is a particular problem for nonbudgetary items, which are spared even the reviews accorded to appropriations. 5. Annual Agency Reports on Corporate Welfare. Every Federal agency could be required to list every program under its purview which confers below-cost or below-market-rate goods, services or other benefits on corporations. They could also publish a list of every corporate beneficiary of those subsidies above a certain de minimis threshold, and the dollar amount of the subsidy conferred. This measure would spur much more news reporting on corporate welfare, and would generate public awareness by assigning proper names to the beneficiaries. These reports should be published on the internet, as should all other corporate welfare-related disclosures. 6. SEC Requirement for Corporate Welfare Disclosure. The Securities Exchange Act could be amended to require publicly traded corporations to list the subsidies (both by type (program) and amount) they receive from governmental bodies, and to publish this information on the internet. Alternatively, the SEC could mandate such disclosure through rulemaking. This disclosure requirement is easily justifiable as in the public interest, since corporate beneficiaries are in many ways better positioned to report on the benefits they receive from government than the government conferors. It would serve a valuable public purpose by assembling in a single location the dollar amounts of public subsidies accorded to the nation's largest corporations; and thereby enabling the citizenry to assess properly the extent and desirability of the subsidies. The disclosure requirement is also appropriate as a disclosure of material interest to shareholders. Government subsidies are of central importance to many of the nation's largest corporations, and to assess fully the value and future prospects of corporate earnings, shareholders have a right to information on government subsidies. 7. Limits on Executive Compensation in Government-Supported Corporations. Where the government is conferring substantial, voluntarily received benefits on corporations, it could reasonably limit the scope of beneficiaries to those which do not engage in particular sorts of socially undesirable behaviors. One such behavior is excessive executive compensation, which heightens income and wealth inequalities, and tears at the nation's social fabric. Government subsidies, including tax expenditures, could be denied to corporations whose executives receive more than a predetermined level of compensation, say those whose ratio of executive-to-lowest-paid- employee compensation is more than a certain amount, perhaps 35-to-1. 8. Prohibition of Government Subsidies to Criminal Corporations. From convicted felons who are persons, the Federal Government, and state and local governments, take away fundamental rights, including the right to vote. Corporations convicted of crimes rarely experience deprivations of anything near that scale. A small and appropriate step might be to deny any form of corporate welfare, including tax expenditures, to any corporation convicted of a certain number of felonies and/or misdemeanors. If the government is to confer subsidies on corporations, surely they should not go to enterprises convicted of criminal wrongdoing. 9. Reciprocal Obligations. The government should seek nonmonetary reciprocal obligations from corporate welfare beneficiaries. These must necessarily vary by category of corporate welfare program and beneficiary. But two types of obligations are of special importance. First is the requirement that certain subsidies be conditioned on beneficiaries enabling consumers to band together in nonpartisan, nonprofit, democratically governed organizations. This can be accomplished by allowing government-chartered consumer organizations that are accountable to their membership to include an insert, at no cost to the company, in the corporate welfare beneficiary's billing envelope, or publishing information on the company's web site. The insert would invite consumers to join the organization, which would work to contain prices, improve product quality and service, advocate for reforms, etc. This mechanism would be particularly appropriate for banks, thrifts and other lending institutions, insurance companies, HMOs and utilities. Second, allocation of rights to government lands or other natural resources could be conditioned on beneficiaries agreeing to abide by environmental regulations, or even to uphold environmental standards that exceed those required by existing regulation. Giveaways, Including R&D Giveaways 10. Prohibition on government giveaways. Government properties, whether real or intangible, should presumptively be sold, leased or rented to corporations for market rates. Except in certain circumstances (such as where consumer pricing considerations are considered of more importance than taxpayer reimbursement), there is no reason for taxpayer assets to be given away to corporations at less than market value. 11. Promote Competition in Allocating Government Resources. Market value will vary based on the terms of the property transfer. Depending on the circumstance, taxpayer revenues may be lower if resources are allocated on a nonexclusive basis. But there is an overriding broad public and consumer interest in promoting economic competition, and legislation could establish a presumption that, where possible, when taxpayer assets are to be transferred to corporations they be conveyed on a nonexclusive basis. 12. Competitive Bidding. In all cases, but especially where the government plans to transfer taxpayer assets to corporations on an exclusive basis, Congress should consider requiring asset transfer prices to be established by auction. 13. Reasonable Pricing Provisions. Where there will be a consumer end-user from the transfer of government assets (as in the case of products brought to market utilizing government-controlled intellectual property rights), the terms of the transfer should require the corporate beneficiary to agree to reasonable pricing provisions. This is of primary importance for exclusive transfers, where transferees may gain monopoly power. Because Federal agencies, especially NIH, have historically done a poor job in enforcing reasonable pricing provisions, serious consideration needs to be given to how such provisions should be administered and enforced. Required disclosure of private investment in product development, and correlating prices with amount and proportion of private investment, may offer one fruitful approach. It may also be possible to include reasonable pricing guarantees in the bidding process, with preference given to bidders making enforceable promises of lower prices. 14. End Fossil Fuel and Nuclear Power R&D. There is no justification for Federal support for these environmentally hazardous, nonrenewable energy sources. As study after study has demonstrated, energy efficiency and renewable energies represent the future superiorities. Insurance, Loans and Bailouts 15. No Discount Insurance. The Congress should consider a legislative presumption against below-market insurance for corporations, requiring a special waiver for exceptions. 16. No Liability Caps. There should be a legislated blanket prohibition on liability caps, which unjustifiably protect corporations from paying for any harms they perpetrate. Liability caps, such as those in Price Anderson, should never accompany governmental insurance schemes. 17. No Discount Loans. The Congress should consider a legislative presumption against below-market loans or loan guarantees for corporations, requiring a special waiver for exceptions. 18. Payback For Bailouts. Legislation could require that all bailout beneficiaries pay back loans in full, with interest, with priority given to repayments to the government over other claimants. 19. Preventing Foreseeable Financial Bailouts. Proposed legislation (H.R. 10) to lift the regulatory walls between banks on the one hand and insurance and securities firms on the others would create too-big- to-fail financial holding companies, with Federal deposit insurance likely to be de facto extended, at no charge, to other financial affiliates. H.R. 10 should be amended to include a provision establishing, in advance of future bailout demands, that no Federal assistance will be made available to financial holding companies or to their nonbank affiliates. Because this is an especially timely matter, I have attached legislative language for such a provision at the end of this testimony. This language was originally prepared last year at the request of then-Senator Alfonse D'Amato. Corporate Tax Expenditures 20. Eliminate All Corporate Tax Expenditures. Because corporate tax expenditures are already compiled in the President's budget submission and by the Joint Committee on Taxation, this step would be less logistically complicated than ending all corporate welfare. Wiping the slate clean of corporate tax expenditures-perhaps the most deeply entrenched type of corporate welfare-would require the tax expenditure beneficiaries and their Congressional allies to justify anew these tax supports, and deserves Congressional consideration. 21. Require Reporting of Corporate Tax Expenditure Beneficiaries. The Internal Revenue Service could be required to publish a list of all corporate tax expenditure recipients over a certain de minimis level. Industry Promotions and Export Assistance 22. End Government Market Promotion. Congress should consider prohibiting government-run advertising and marketing schemes for private corporations. 23. End Export Assistance. Congress should debate eliminating export assistance programs, or making them available only on a strict means-tested basis. Local, County, and State Corporate Welfare 24. Regional and National Compacts. Congressional legislation should authorize anti-corporate welfare compacts between states, enabling them to enter into binding arrangements to refuse to enter a race to the bottom against each other in terms of using special tax breaks and related benefits or stadiums to influence business, including sports team, location decisions. 25. Surtax on Local and State Corporate Welfare. Congress should consider requiring the IRS to treat local and state corporate welfare expenditures as income upon which Federal taxes should be paid. Mr. Chairman, there is a rising discontent across the country with the hijacking of public assets to benefit narrow corporate interests. The public's frustration with the corporate welfare state is palpable, but it remains inchoate and unorganized. The Green Scissors Coalition and others represented at today's hearing have done vital work in publicizing the issue, but it has yet to attain the visibility needed to grab the public's attention and focused energies. The time is now for you and other courageous Members of Congress who truly believe in ``Ending Corporate Welfare As We Know It'' to launch a series of GAO, CRS and CBO studies, to conduct extensive hearings in Washington, DC, and across the country, to introduce and vigorously push for corporate welfare legislation, and by your leadership to force this issue with such broad appeal onto the front pages and the nation's television screens. There is a nascent national consumer-taxpayer-environmentalist- worker-small business coalition that is waiting to be consolidated on this issue. If these forces are united, they will form a powerful political force that can help rescue our political democracy from the narrow interests that now dominate it. Corporate welfare cuts to the core of political self-governance, because it is perpetuated in large measure through campaign contributions and the subversion of procedural and substantive democracy; and because the perpetuation of corporate welfare itself misallocates public and private resources and exacerbates the disparities of wealth, influence and power that run counter to a functioning political system in which the people rule. A final note before closing. Given its breadth, this testimony necessarily paints in broad strokes. It is important to reiterate that we do not oppose all corporate welfare. But it is important that even ``good'' corporate welfare programs operate with safeguards in place to ensure procedural fairness, full disclosure of beneficiaries, frequent review and reaffirmation, and reciprocal payments and nonmonetary commitments from recipients. This hearing is an important and historic beginning, Mr. Chairman. But if it is not followed up by more hearings and a sustained effort that involves more and more Members of Congress and citizen organizations, it will be of modest consequence. We are ready to join with you to help expand on the opportunity presented by this hearing. Thank you. Chairman Kasich. You can take a breath. Let me, Mr. Nader, ask you kind of the fundamental questions. I know you feel passionately about everything you said and that reasonable people can disagree with a number of the specifics that you laid out, but I don't think it is possible to reject a chunk of what you have said in terms of the common sense results and approaches. You said that you offered an amendment in the banking Committee where you got 40 noes and six yeses. Now, I had an experience, a couple of experiences here. One was we had a vote on the overseas Private Investment Corporation, and we snuck up on them, and we stopped the program for, I guess, I don't know, we stopped the refunding of the program for about a half a year, and then what happened was the people who were the beneficiaries went to their constituents, and then they had their constituents call--the ones who had gotten the benefits of this program called the Members of Congress, and the next time we got a vote on this program working with a coalition of members on the Floor of Republicans and Democrats, we had our lunch handed to us. Now, we did make some progress in the area of timber sales. In fact, we were able to negotiate a successful agreement on timber sales. You know, I was somebody that came to the Congress in 1989. You could get all the people that voted for my budget in a Volkswagon, and I am never afraid to walk a lonely road in government. You can see how much interest there is in this hearing today, very limited interest in this hearing today in terms of Member participation. Members are busy, so they have to establish priorities. But the difficulty is, first of all, getting Members' interests in this subject, and I know you believe that there is this enormous political vein out there that can be tapped into. If there is one, I don't know where it is because this has been a huge struggle because when you take these issues on--and there are a lot of young people in this room today--you don't make any friends, trust me. All you make are enemies; and the question is, I don't want to just go 40 to six every year and then we can vent against certain programs and it sounds good, but we don't make any real progress. This hearing is well covered today because it is a novelty. You showed up on the Hill; there are going to be conservatives on the hill who are all going to testify to essentially the same thing, and this issue does capture a little bit of media attention. But the question is, how are we going to win some victories? Because all--if all this is are hearings and testimony to committees that are not very well attended, then I can tell you that you are going to get zero, not going to win anything. So the question is, how can we get the conservatives, the liberals, the progressives to get behind? I used to think we could find 10. I no longer think we can even find 10 issues where we can combine ourselves and lead a large campaign. How are we able to, in your judgment, make some real accomplishments against several of the most egregious problems? I mean, you have pointed a lot of things and you talk about, for example, stadiums, and people on both sides of the issue can make big arguments about that issue, but I think there are some issues here, for example, the 1872 mining Act, where you are going to still not get unanimity but you can get an overwhelming consensus that that needs to be reformed. How are we going to work to build the political support to actually have some clearcut victories on the floor of the House and the Senate and not just sit around and talk? I have been engaged in this thing now for 4 or 5 years, and we have had, like I say, some significant victories but few in number. So what do we do about it? Mr. Nader. Well, first of all, Mr. Chairman, this is the first time that the subject of corporate welfare in its amplitude has been on C-SPAN, which means that it is going to reach at least a million people, and we shouldn't say that this issue is a forlorn one for courageous Members of Congress before we at least see whether the mass media is willing to carry it to millions of people. I know that people who watch C-SPAN get back to their Members of Congress about what they have seen. Our testimony will be on our Web site, www.essential.org, for further access, and we invite the comments of people all over the country in their favorite area of corporate welfare critique. Now, where you cannot in a straight-on attack on a corporate subsidy win and you have tried to go after these subsidies straight on, there are angular approaches that lay the basis to build for future victories. One is to put in every time you can amendments in appropriate legislation for disclosure, for specific disclosure of the kind and amount and the beneficiaries of corporate welfare. Another is to put in amendments for sunsets. Another is to put in amendments for reciprocity. You say, OK, Bristol-Myers, you are getting this annual billion dollar revenue Taxol drug, what are you giving back in return? So that you collaterally attack the problems from different ways where you cannot head- on overwhelm and defeat a particular program. We know that information is the currency of democracy. We know that when information is out and when it is specific by company, by program, it develops a larger audience of outrage and concern which reverberates back to Congress. So I think in some answer to your question, why don't you try a procedural strategy in order to lay the basis for a substantive attack on these subsidies and programs. The procedural strategy is outlined in our testimony, but it really revolves around things like disclosure, sunset, reciprocity, standing to challenge on the part of the taxpayer. Notice, not a single taxpayer in this country can challenge any of these programs. I will never forget, just before the Ford administration left office, the Commerce Department issued an announcement for a large loan guarantee to General Dynamics to guarantee loans for the construction of liquified natural gas tankers to move gas from Indonesia to Japan, a multibillion dollar loan guarantee, and there was no involvement by Congress to approve it. There was no public docket at the Department of Commerce, and no taxpayer could challenge. Now, this is a one-hundred-percent shut out procedurally of the taxpayers of this country, and they are told no matter how wasteful these subsidies are, no matter how much corruption there may be, no matter how much documentation, you as a taxpayer can't have the chance to prove the case in court. So procedural attacks are extremely effective when you don't have the full political support here in Congress to go after the subsidies directly. Chairman Kasich. Well, Ralph, I think part of what you are suggesting is more lawsuits, and I frankly don't like that idea. I have a more fundamental question. If we know that somebody is getting $8 or $9 billion off of a public land and they are virtually paying no royalties for that and you are trying to tell me that you can't take an issue like that head on and win, that the way we have to go is in some procedural direction. I mean, the question is, why can't you win? You know why I think you can't win, because I don't think we have the sustained support from people who oppose these things willing to dedicate a lot of time and a lot of energy to taking these issues on. Mr. Nader. But there is another reason, Mr. Chairman. Where the executive branch is the culpable branch, let us say they are not doing the right job and it needs to be challenged, where the legislative branch is too under the influence of big money and all the rest, it is time to ask whether the judicial branch has a role here. I believe in the judicial branch of government. I think our forebears bled and fought for the right to have their day in court. I think that is an all-American right, and I think the attack on access to the court has become too extreme and almost wild in its ferocity by the business community. When I say taxpayer challenge, what I mean is not a taxpayer going to challenge a government program and make a billion dollars. The taxpayer is going to challenge a program, for example, under injunctive relief, under mandamus relief by the courts who tell the agencies, you are allowing the taxpayer resources to be looted under existing law. Now, sometimes it is good to give the taxpayer bounty, too, to facilitate that kind of incentive, but I believe in the judicial branch of government as an essential counterweight. Chairman Kasich. But let me tell you, it is not--you know, I don't think it is all the way you paint it. Let me just give an example with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. In my own congressional district, there were a couple, I think, businesses--I am not even aware of them all--that benefited from OPIC. So if the people who benefit call their representative and say, hey, by the way, do you know that this program has been helpful to me, and we have created 50 new jobs because of this and the people trying to kill this are just dead wrong, when that Congressman gets no calls, absolutely no calls from any of the other folks who are out there who are members of conservative organizations or liberal organizations, where there truly is a grassroots support, because presumed in your testimony is that there is, the public wants to unleash their frustration to level the playing field, the problem is you are not getting people to call the other way and to say this program ought to go. And my view is that until the grassroots organizations that have determined that they have a stake in eliminating some of these unnecessary programs get involved, it is not as though it is some huge deal. It is minor groups of people who really call, but they are the only ones that call, and I think if you had people in the conservative and liberal side saying, cut that, government, it probably would be cut. Maybe we need to make a better effort to try and mobilize our own forces. But let me go to Mr. Toomey, who sat through the entire testimony and recognize him for 5 minutes or whatever time he may consume. Mr. Toomey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for joining us today, Mr. Nader. I wanted to pursue a slightly different direction with you. There are often arguments made that corporate welfare amounts to a misallocation of capital in the economy, and I tend to agree with that. I think there is a compelling case to be made that their very existence requires taxes to be higher than they might otherwise be, hard to refute that. Corporate welfare is often justifiably criticized for the inherent unfairness in singling out some industries and companies as opposed to others, but what I wanted to explore with you this morning was the question of the constitutionality of this. Could you cite for me where in the Constitution the Federal Government is authorized to pick a single company or a single industry and blatantly subsidize that business? Do you think that is constitutional at all? Mr. Nader. Well, the general response is that it is under the general welfare clause of the Constitution, which seems to been an infinitely expandable clause of the Constitution. The critique of that is as follows: one is the belief by some legal scholars that the definition of public purpose--which justifies the State to engage in eminent domain, take over neighborhoods, buy out homes and small businesses, and hand the land plus a subsidy package to a corporation or to a parking lot or to a gambling casino--has no boundaries in our court cases. And unless it is given constitutional boundaries, then the answer to your question is there is no limit to the use of the taxpayer dollar. There is zero. Let me repeat that. Apart from building a church, apart from the State/church separation, under present Supreme Court doctrine, there is no limit as to how the tax dollar in the United States can be used by government. Mr. Toomey. Well, getting back to the general---- Mr. Nader. In a constitutional sense. Obviously they can't use it to bribe somebody. Mr. Toomey. Right. Mr. Nader. And the second answer to the thrust of your question is to look to the commerce clause. The argument there is that the commerce clause was designed to prevent the States from challenging one another, to lure business from one another and create barriers. These may include the passive barriers that are created such as when Virginia and Maryland wrestled over lavishing subsidies on Marriott, even though, as it turned out, the Baltimore Sun reported Marriott was going to stay in Maryland all the while. The passive barriers are when a State says to a corporation in another State, if you relocate in our State, we will give you a tremendous tax holiday. In Professor Enrich's article in the Harvard Law Review, the argument is that that is a violation of the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution because it effects in an indirect, in a passive way the same kind of barrier which had been struck down between the States. Mr. Toomey. To touch sort of in reverse order here, with regard to the commerce clause, the constitutional authority to regulate commerce amongst the States seems clear to me was intended to make regular commerce amongst the States and to strike down as you pointed out the affirmative barriers, and with respect to the general welfare clauses, to both of these put together, to those who would defend corporate welfare and cite these clauses, it seems to me essentially suggesting that there is no realm which is not appropriate for the Federal Government to engage in, and that clearly contradicts what the Constitution is all about, which is limiting the power of the Federal Government to those powers enumerated within it. So it seems to me you have to believe--in order to believe that these clauses justify corporate welfare, you have to believe that the Founding Fathers clearly contradicted themselves within the Constitution and didn't know whether they wanted a limited or unlimited Federal Government. Mr. Nader. Well, you put it in a very succinct way. If constitutionalism means anything, it means boundaries; it means limits in different dimensions. And when it comes to corporate welfare programs, there are no limits. Mr. Toomey. Well, I appreciate your coming here today and look forward to working with you and others to find ways to reduce this rather egregious spending we have here at the Federal Government. Thank you. Chairman Kasich. Gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Hoeffel. Mr. Hoeffel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Nader, thank you very much, great testimony, very thought provoking. Your lead remedy is the proposal for a bill to eliminate all corporate welfare under the concept, as you put it, to let them start over again, which has a certain appeal; and you referenced with the phrase remember zero-based budgeting, the notion of obliterating all the bad stuff and making people start over and justify their program or their subsidy. I do remember zero-based budgeting as a young state legislator in Pennsylvania. When Jimmy Carter talked about it, I thought it was wonderful. I tried to get it going in Pennsylvania, got nowhere. Zero-based budgeting got nowhere here in Washington, and my concern is that your lead remedy, which has a certain simplicity and cleanness to it, simply won't ever be passed. So is there some other provision such as the establishment of a commission to recommend changes to Congress, a better way of going to try to get the ball rolling? I mean, we have got the power now to change all these things, and we don't change them. Is there some more gradual legislative process we ought to consider? Mr. Nader. Well, first of all, I wouldn't give up on this first recommendation because even if it never gets through, it has the great potential to shake up the situation and give these issues more visibility. This relates to what Chairman Kasich was saying, that nothing is going to happen until the public is galvanized. So as an instrument of discussion, debate, visibility, it is worth trying. I think that was true for the advocates of zero-based budgeting. The difference here of course is budgeting constitutionally is supposed to start in the House, but actually starts in the executive branch. So zero-based budgeting relied on executive branch initiative more than this proposal, which would rely much more on legislative initiative. Do you know there was a proposed commission? It never got off the ground. Remember, Senator Kerry was on the commission. Mr. Hoeffel. I thought Senator McCain had a proposal for a corporate welfare commission. Mr. Nader. That is right, and it never got through. So you can see even something as preliminary as that proposal is opposed by the lobbyists. Anything's going to be opposed by the lobbyists; but remember, you got through the Congress a deletion of the $30 million for the bonuses for the executives at Martin Marietta because it was put in legislation. So this idea of an angular approach procedurally, reciprocity, disclosure, sunset, if dozens of members who share a common belief here put these amendments in at all times they are going to break through, and they are all going to become magnets for discussion as well. Chairman Kasich. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. Hoeffel. Yes. Chairman Kasich. Let me ask, Mr. Nader, are you willing to take on the challenge of picking out some of the conservatives who are going to be here today and sitting with them personally and trying to come up with one or two items that you would be willing to dedicate the grassroots effort to undertake and fight both on the House and the Senate floor? Mr. Nader. Definitely, but I would want to do both. What you said---- Chairman Kasich. I am just saying to you that is the way you will stir up the public is that you say here is an outrage, and it is a national campaign to say that we are going to show that we can win one fight, and all the focus goes into one fight. You can all have all the commissions you want. They are never going to pass. Ralph, you have got to get into the real world on this what is going on up here. It ain't going to work that way. If you want to get something defeated, you and the conservatives have got to get people stirred up in all these congressional districts who are going to say we are going to change X and we are going to put everything we have to win one single fight, and when you win the first fight, guess what, it makes it easier on the second fight. And right now, there is no support for a member who goes to the House Floor to fight any of these subsidy programs, zippo support; and as long as there is zippo support, you are not going to pass commissions. What is that word you used there--it is not the head on approach, but the angular approach--triangular approach. Mr. Nader. Not triangular. Chairman Kasich. Angular approach. I mean that is fine, but you're not going anywhere with that. You have got to win a couple of these fights, and you know what happened with timber because both the conservationists, the environmentalists and the conservatives and the liberals all said yes, and there was a ready base of support for people who would go to town hall meetings and drive the congressmen crazy. If you are not driving congressmen crazy, you are not going to win any votes because the other side is going to dominate, and it is democracy. It is not an evil, wicked thing. It is just the way it works, and we can win these, but there is no substitute for people power. The gentleman is recognized, I am sorry. Mr. Hoeffel. No. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the comment. I would just close by saying that I agree with the Chair that it would be excellent to pick out some particularly egregious examples of corporate welfare and get a coalition to stop it. I also think, though, there has got to be a legislative mechanism so that we don't have to rely on a great crusade to stop these abuses because most of them are hidden away, as you so well identify, and we need something in addition to our annual appropriations process which has not succeeded in eliminating corporate welfare. We need some structure, but I thank you, Mr. Nader, for being here. Mr. Nader. I think the comments of the Chairman are well taken. I would only add that, in addition to focusing on one or two high profile targets in the corporate welfare area, I would I also favor this approach, the procedural approach, sunset, disclosure, reciprocity, all that because, you know, if you throw enough amendments in the field, you are going to divide the opposition. You are going to get a few through, and the few through help open up the field for the substantive assault on these boondoggles. But I think it is important we gather together with ``the other side'' as you say and pick one or two that can be mobilized and focused on. Chairman Kasich. The gentleman from New Hampshire is recognized. Mr. Sununu. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much for your testimony, Mr. Nader. It was very helpful; nothing if not thorough. And it didn't leave a lot of areas for further exploration, but I do want to highlight one area that you touched on, and that has to do with the basic reason that these subsidies are harmful. We heard about the capital allocation and productivity issues. It certainly hurts the economy when we are distorting the economic effects of investment. We heard about the high tax rates, the fact that we are collecting more taxes than we need to in order to provide these subsidies, but you mentioned the issue of economic justice and basic fairness. The fact that a number of these subsidy programs tend not to just distort the economy but distort the economy in a way that disproportionately hurts those that arguably need economic assistance the most. And I think that is at the heart of a very strong moral argument for looking at these programs, eliminating them and either channeling the funds into programs that really do make a difference or ultimately giving the funds back to individuals so that they can make decisions that are in their own best interest. I think the example you used was in Detroit or in the Michigan area. There is a great irony here, though, because you have used this moral argument for explaining why these subsidies are bad, but oftentimes those that support the subsidies the most try to make an economic argument on their own behalf, trying to suggest that, no, these are actually helpful, we are creating jobs, we are stimulating the economy, we are supporting opportunities. That is tough, very difficult to counter that economic rhetoric unless you can cite specific examples as you did very eloquently. Could you please elaborate on that, the example you gave earlier, talk a little bit more about how these distortions oftentimes hurt those who need the economic assistance the most? Mr. Nader. Well, first of all, take the Marriott hotel chain. They got a $38 million tax break to stay in Maryland. Now, what if you owned a 20-room inn a mile from one of the Marriott hotels? How would you feel? You don't get a tax break. You have to pay your bills. There must be a simmering of displeasure among many small businesses who see their competitors get the breaks and the subsidies, et cetera, when they can't. To highlight this, I often imagine what would happen if in New York City 500 small businesses got together, petitioned to Mayor Giuliani and said if the city does not give them a big tax break, they will move to New Jersey. You see, it is only if you are big enough that you get these breaks. The other thing is I think the record shows that joint government business R&D like these partnerships with the auto industry are the worst idea imaginable. They freeze innovation. They freeze competition. They tell the three auto companies, hey, you don't have to compete with one another anymore, you are in with Uncle Sam in enormous number of meetings producing nothing. Six years into the program, $1 billion almost expended, there is almost nothing to show for the clean car program. In the meantime who is coming in with a 75 mile per gallon car next year? Honda and Toyota. They are not part of this so-called clean car initiative. So it actually restrains innovation. Now, there are some government programs that are valuable. If you want to make one distinction, subsidies by the many for the many--that was, until recently, the postal system for years--may often be meritorious. Subsidies by the many for the few are very mischievous, very unfair, and they have a lot of unintended consequences, as well as entrenching interests. Mr. Sununu. I would like to hear you talk a little bit more about the partnership for a next generation vehicle. It is a very significant investment in automotive technology, and we all recognize the importance of the automobile to this society. But I think there is no denying the fact that the corporations within the automotive industry right now are enjoying very significant success. Now, there is a little irony here because you are one that at least part of your notoriety or famous name is due in part to your interest in automotive technology back in the 1970s. But at the same time, you are pointing out the inefficiencies and the market distortions associated with this particular program under which partnership for the next generation vehicle we are spending upwards of $200 million to develop technologies that ought to be developed under a competitive environment nonetheless. I want to talk a little bit about that irony, and under what circumstances do you think that the Federal Government ought to be subsidizing, in this case automotive technology, but any applied technology in general. Mr. Nader. Well, first, I objected to that program when it was first announced in 1993. I wrote a letter to the White House giving my reasons. One reason is that it effectively exempts the domestic auto industry from the antitrust laws. The major auto companies have a very notorious history of product fixing. Basically, through their trade association, they agreed not to develop and market pollution control devices. If one went first, the others were going to have to follow, and there is all kinds of tumult, et cetera. So they agreed not to compete. And I also suggested that if the government wanted to develop a clean car and they realized that the auto industry, notwithstanding its massive profits, was not willing to put R&D money in, was not willing to fund MIT, your alma mater, or something to develop a clean car, you know how I would do it? I would do it the way canned food was developed. When Napoleon, unfortunately for a very bad purpose, Napoleon wanted canned food to take his armies to Russia because they couldn't rely on a steady diet, he had a contest. When the utilities wanted to see developed an efficient refrigerator a few years ago, they had a contest. I think Whirlpool won it. So if the government wants to really stimulate innovation and they can't get the industry to do what is necessary, have a technical contest with clear specifications so that all the best ideas and proposals come to the forefront. Mr. Sununu. Thank you very much. Let me ask one final question and that has to do a little bit with the angular approach to this problem. We have passed in this committee a budget process reform bill. It is going to see votes on the House Floor in the coming weeks. It does include some provision for encouraging committees to perform oversight and to come up with a schedule for reauthorizing programs so that we don't see funds continually appropriated for those that aren't authorized. Beyond those ideas, is there anything that comes to your mind that you would like to see included and an overhaul of the budget process so we don't see--so that we minimize the likelihood of funding the corporate welfare we have been talking about but also so that we have a process that is as open and as efficient as possible? Mr. Nader. Yes. In fact, the reason why we now know anything about tax expenditures is because there is a requirement for the Treasury to report tax expenditures, but they don't report it by company; they report it by category. So now there is a little bit more fertile public discussion and debate. The first thing I would say in response to you is to require a pattern of disclosure, so that Congress and the public knows what the benefits cost, and who is getting what. That could be a very good part of the budget. Another part could be a sunset provision. Another part could be an explanation by the disbursing agency as to the effects of the corporate welfare. Citizens for Tax Justice Executive Director Robert McIntyre will testify later in the day, but a lot of these tax breaks, say, for the energy industry, didn't produce what they were designed to produce, whether it was domestic exploration instead of foreign exploration or whatever. A lot of the investment tax credits don't produce increased investment and productive appointment and so the question is to say to the bureaucrats, OK, you have been doing this program now for 10, 15 years on the basis that it is going to fulfill a certain purpose. Has it fulfilled a purpose? Mr. Sununu. But to slightly distort an old adage, figures lie and bureaucrats figure. You can always look at a program and construct some argument that, well, the funds that we disbursed moved through the hands of eight different corporations, and their total employment is 1.2 million jobs and to essentially take credit for opportunity growth and activity that is already there but to nonetheless create what looks like a strong economic argument for these programs, and I have seen that time and again. My concern with that would be that the quality of the information wouldn't necessarily be up to your standards or mine for that matter. Mr. Nader. That is true. You can never avert that risk. However, Stanley Surrey when he was at the Treasury Department did come out with reports saying that certain investment credits, tax credits, et cetera, just didn't work. There are opportunities for more candid and trustworthy government officials to have their say. I would also have a public docket. Under the Administrative Procedures Act, if you are dealing with regulation, say a proposed safety standard, the relevant agency has a public docket, everyone gets their licks in, then they put out the final standard, and it is subject to judicial review. There is no such process dealing with subsidies, not for billion-dollar loan guarantees for liquified natural gas tankers, or for others. As a result, people who don't like what is going on in universities and corporations in terms of technology transfer have no voice. There is no administrative opportunity before the agencies and departments to have an input. Procedural due process is probably one of the greatest contributions of the rule of law in the history of the world. We always have to ask the questions if there is an abuse, is there a procedural due process? Is there a public docket? Does the agency have to justify its actions? You know that when there is some officials who dissent from the official line--let us say there is a six-person agency or a three-person agency, there is an opportunity for dissent. In the corporate welfare area, it is fiat, fiat, fiat, that is the way it comes out. Mr. Sununu. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Kasich. Gentleman from North Carolina is recognized, Mr. Price. Mr. Price. Mr. Nader, I want to thank you for your appearance here today, for your comprehensive, well-prepared, well-presented testimony. That doesn't surprise me. I learned a great deal from you years ago as a Senate staffer on the staff of Senator Bob Bartlett as we were laying the groundwork for the Radiation Protection Act, as you may remember; and we had hearings on that subject in 1967. You may have noticed that two of the pioneers who testified in those hearings Merril Eisenbud and Carl Morgan both recently passed away. But I am glad to have you here today and to have you open up this rather complicated subject which we do need to attend to, and I appreciate the Chairman for scheduling these hearings. You began your testimony with an attempt to define corporate welfare, made a couple of runs at it, and then came up with what seemed to me to be well-conceived screens that might be applied. I gather your point is not to say that anything that one might define as corporate welfare is per se-- that that doesn't automatically argue for its elimination, but it does place a certain burden of proof on the policy, and these screens suggest ways in which it might be further explored. You furnish some very clear examples, it seems. Mr. Chairman, if we are looking for something to head the list, it seems to me that the 1872 Mining Act surely would be a candidate where these companies are mining Federal lands basically free of charge. There are many convincing examples. What I want to ask you to do, though, is to deal with some cases that might be more difficult and to help us figure out how these screens might work. There are all kinds of groups, of course, using this designation of corporate welfare and arguing on that basis that subsidies or tax expenditures ought to be eliminated. Let me just ask you about a couple of examples that seem to me much more difficult. One screen you might have added, it seems to me, is whether a given program, even though it fits, might actually save greater expenditures given the alternatives. Crop insurance might be an example. Crop insurance definitely helps our farmers, I think, in important ways. It also happens to avert greater expenses that might come about through disaster relief, and that is the whole rationale or one of the major rationales for crop insurance. The expenditures are significant, but the expenditures, if crop insurance weren't there, are surely even greater, and then obviously you also factor in the factors of public benefit. And then also, what about policies where the corporate welfare aspect is incidental to a larger purpose? I am not sure the screens quite catch that either. For example, the Citizens for Tax Justice have been very critical of tax exempt bonds for State and local governments. Well, surely the bondholders do benefit, but the much larger purpose, of course, is to enable State and local governments to raise revenue for public purposes. I don't know if those two examples trigger any thoughts that you might want to share, but it does seem to me that while there are some very clear and very egregious examples, we also do need to define rather carefully at the margins what kinds of policies do and do not fall within this rubric and what it would take to justify them. Mr. Nader. Well, you have made two very fine points. You know, sometimes these business welfare programs occur because the private sector is not willing to come forth. Crop insurance is such an example. Farmers had a great deal of difficulty getting any private crop insurance. It was a hard thing to actuarially package, and so the system in place now was launched. So sometimes when the marketplace itself does not provide either any entry or a reasonably priced entry, the government moves in, and that is true for Price Anderson. It is true for crop insurance. Right now, if you look to crop insurance, you would have to reevaluate it and say, number one, can the farmers through their cooperatives--and they have large cooperatives--provide their own insurance? Two, is the private sector, now that it has seen that crop insurance, is actuarially assessable, et cetera, able to provide a better service than the present system? So that is part of re-evaluating something that was a very needed public service for farmers, given locusts and storms and other disasters, which as you say would have come right back to the taxpayer in terms of even greater expenditure. On municipal bonds--I am sure Bob McIntyre can elaborate on this, as well as the many other good people who are coming later in the day. It is important to raise the question, given some of the scandals in the municipal bond area now and the lack of competition, because the market is often cornered by a few firms, can the economic advantage to local communities of using tax exempt bonds be directly handled rather than indirectly through some direct Federal, State and local relationship? I am not certain that that would come out that way, but again, what might have been a good idea 20 years ago might have led to an abuse today. Market conditions change, more certainties are realized. Let us look at it again. I think that is important. There is no question that Federal subsidies programs have launched new industries. As I mentioned, some of the most burgeoning industries in the country wouldn't be anything like they are today without government research and support for vital technology. The 707 came right out of a military plane. The whole semiconductor industry and the computer industry benefited from the infusion of government R&D. NIH has played a leading role in developing health science industries. Then you say, what about reciprocity? Why is it a giveaway? What rights do the public have to public broadcasts on the public airway? What rights do the public have to the Internet, which is heavily subsidized and created by the public? I think what Chairman Kasich has done in this hearing is resurrect an old-fashioned tradition at Congress, which is to take an issue and begin looking at it with great detail and great input by the membership. Pretty soon you will get input from around the country because they will hear about it. So we don't come in with some categorical notion of everything out, or everything in. What we do is establish a set of principles from fairness to strict economic returns for government assets that make this issue much more effective and workable. I mean, the idea of billions and billions of dollars going into coal and oil and nuclear and very little in the last 50 years going into renewable and energy conversation by comparison is just bad economics. It is bad environmentalism. It is a bad use of taxpayer dollars. We could now have the biggest solar export industry in the world. Instead, we are slipping behind Japan and five European countries, but we have had all these boondoggles, the so-called clean coal initiative which will be examined later, the infamous synfuel boondoggle, billions of dollars down the drain, which came because there is no congressional input and no public review. It is largely secret, and bad mistakes are made by subverting democratic processes, subverting procedural safeguards and substantive input. As the old saying that was attributed to President Jackson goes, ``If a country's in trouble, the solution is not less democracy, it is more democracy.'' Mr. Price. Well, I appreciate that elaboration. We might in the end agree or disagree on specific policies that would pass these screens or would pass the test, but I think you usefully suggested some questions we ought to be asking and some burdens of proof we ought to be imposing. Thank you. Chairman Kasich. We are going to have three Members up shortly, so I would ask members to--we will move along and have Mr. Nader kind of limit his remarks. Mr. Moran, gentleman from Virginia, any questions? Mr. Moran. There was a list of 13 witnesses, but it was not balanced. I don't see any witnesses that actually have some experience in the use of these programs. What we have is a list of witnesses like Mr. Nader who has done some extraordinarily good research and is very articulate and persuasive, and we have Members who have already made up their minds and have introduced legislation. But I think a hearing like this is going to be more effective if we have individuals in businesses that are directly affected by this, using these programs and have an opportunity to justify it, and let us decide whether they make their case or not. I understand there was somebody that you had invited, a tech executive, but they didn't come, although they were never on the original list. So I think if I am going to do this, it would probably be more effective to at least give the appearance of more balance because I would like to hear from them and better understand how these programs are supposed to work. I agree with Dave Price that I can't for the life of me figure out how we can justify economically to the majority of the population maintaining the 1872 mining law. Most of the companies that have benefited from it are foreign firms anyway, and they get in many cases billions of dollars using public property that they are mining and are paying, what, two fifty an acre or something in some cases. This is absurd. I mean, it is almost criminal to be able to take that from the public, to use it for such high profit making companies that make such high profits and have a very substantial profit margin, it appears. So that is pure politics. It is Congress' fault. It is inexcusable. It would seem we ought to do something about it. Likewise, some of the timber programs where we pay for the roads, and the royalties we get don't come close to paying for the cost of the roads, and oftentimes in the virgin forests or forests that clearly have an ecological benefit to the entire population; so, again, it would appear to be pure politics, and even in timber programs, increasingly these seem to be Canadian, Japanese firms, particularly Japanese firms, and they are processing the lumber in their country, which is where the jobs are. The jobs aren't so much in cutting down the trees. It is the processing and selling the lumber and marketing the paper and so on. The third one is in grazing. How private landowners can compete for offering grazing on their land when the public gives it such a deep, deep subsidy is again scandalous to be doing that. Of course, poor Mike Synar used to do that every time, and every year he would try to correct it, and the people in his district were furious at him. They had the benefit, they didn't want to lose it, and people like you are a real annoyance when people have a nice benefit going, a nice thing going for themselves and somebody like you comes up and say, hey, wait a minute, this isn't fair; this ought to be corrected. And I know that there are few of us on the Hill who have the kind of intellectual strength and courage that you have consistently shown throughout your career. Basically, that is been your career, and I applaud you for doing so, Mr. Nader. I do think sometimes you go a little over the top on some of this stuff--you get a little carried away--and that is why I want to hear from some of the beneficiaries of these programs so we can make sure that we have got a balanced presentation. Some of the foreign programs where we offer subsidies, OPIC really pays for itself, and so while you can argue that that money may not be used most efficiently, we do get enough money back that I think it washes, but when you get into the IMF--and I guess you are not recommending eliminating ESM--but I think you reference some programs like the IMF and so on, probably the enhanced structural adjustment, et cetera. We have got an awful lot of poverty throughout the world, and we could give it in direct grants and too often those direct grants, at least during the Cold War period, went to people in power, and they used it and little of the money stayed in the country except in their palaces and most of it wound up over in Switzerland in the case of some countries. So I think if we are going to provide aid, it ought to be in the form of loans, even if we write off those loans and deeply subsidize the interest cost. But you know, if we become too perfectionist in our approach, there is very little we are going to do, particularly in terms of foreign countries where we have very little control over their forms of emerging democracy and free enterprise systems. So I just want to see some caution in this, but nevertheless, I would like to see a lot more progress than has been accomplished. I liked your article, a terrific article, but it brings to mind some testimony that Donald Trump gave in the early 1990's when we had the credit crunch and the recession, particularly in commercial offices, and he said, you know, the problem is the 1986 law--I am looking for a light; I don't see a light, but I guess you are being generous, thank you--the problem is the 1986 law. He says that, you know, I made more money from the 1986 law that gave an across-the-board benefit to wealthy people like me than I did under the preceding tax code, but I have done much less to generate jobs and to act in a way consistent with the public welfare. Even though I would still be making money, I wouldn't be making as much money and my money would be much more targeted if it hadn't been for that 1986 law, and he suggested we ought to target tax incentives. He said if you target tax incentives, I am going to where the money is. Where if tax incentives are-- I am going to spend more of my money in ways that are consistent with what public officials consider to be in the greatest good. Likewise, technology executives, particularly when they were asked what would you like, they made us the most selfish recommendation, which is human nature. We would like an across- the-board tax cut, so we pay less personal taxes, and we eliminate a lot of tax incentives. Subsequently, those industries came back and said, you know, that really wasn't what was in our best interest. It hurt jobs, it hurt our industry, and we wish that we could put back some of those targeted tax incentives. This is the argument I am making with you. I am sort of using you as a foil here because I am really directing it at our Chairman, who vastly prefers across-the-board tax cuts instead of targeted tax incentives. Chairman Kasich. Gentleman's time is definitely winding down. Jim, we have got some Members here. Mr. Moran. But that is what I am trying to elicit from you. If you are going to have one or the other, don't we accomplish more with targeted incentives than across-the-board tax cuts? How is that for winding up real quick? Chairman Kasich. Good job. Mr. Nader. I am going to answer this very quickly. The biggest abuses come from these targeted tax cuts. They are not followed through to see whether they register. Most of those haven't registered. The safe harbor targeted cut in 1981 was a disaster in terms of its pretension to increase investment in productive equipment. General Electric made $6.5 billion in those 3 years, received a $120 million refund, paid no Federal income tax, and then invested in buying RCA. What they would have paid to the government they used instead to buy RCA. That further concentrated the number of contractors to the Pentagon and didn't create new jobs or new productive equipment. So I would hold that targeted tax cuts should be very, very narrowly tailored, like if we want to build a solar energy-- incubate a solar energy industry and there is a definite way to measure it, that is a good targeted tax cut, but overall it is an invitation to broad abuse. Mr. Moran. Well, I can see---- Mr. Kasich. The gentleman's time has kind of expired here. I know he didn't get the answer he wanted, but that is OK. Mr. Collins, do you have any questions? Mr. Collins. Just briefly. Chairman Kasich. The gentleman is recognized. Mr. Collins. You mentioned targeted tax cuts. I think tax cuts should be targeted to working folks in this country, but I also think that there should be some targeted tax incentives to create jobs for working folks in this country. Jim, you just mentioned you would love to hear from some how tax incentives or the lack of tax incentives affect their particular industries. I just left the Ways and Means Committee, and some of that is going on over there right now, especially in the area of international trade as how foreign tax codes differ from U.S. Tax codes. In Mr. Nader's remarks here he refers to the Daimler, Daimler Chrysler corporation and an interesting question was, why is it not a Chrysler Daimler, Daimler corporation which would be a U.S. Corporation versus a German corporation? I am sure that several things went into making the decision as to why it is headquartered in Germany or one of the large parts of that decision was not even a consideration. It was the fact that the U.S. Tax codes are very brutal to corporations, especially those as compared to tax codes in Germany and other nations. So there is a lot of consideration that is going on in not only just England. Chrysler, which you have other corporations like BP and Case and Volvo, all of those, the headquarters are in other countries rather than here. Eventually I am afraid you will see more and more of those U.S. Jobs go to those nations where there is a more favorable tax code, tax incentives, tax provisions that some people would call corporate welfare. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Kasich. I want to thank you for coming today. We are going to have testimony from Mr. Sununu, Mr. Shadegg, and Mr. Miller, and I encourage you at some point to perhaps give Mr. Miller a call. He has been fighting a long struggle on the issue of sugar that I think would be very interesting for you to talk to him, and I will also let the panel that is going to come soon of the conservatives know of your interests to on one level see if we can find one or two issues where we can raise some public support to make a change, and I want to thank you for your appearance here today and your exhaustive testimony and we will just see where this whole thing will lead. Mr. Nader. Thank you. I think this is a good beginning today and we hope to follow through on some of your suggestions. I thank the members of the committee as well. Chairman Kasich. Thank you, sir. We are now going to recognize Mr. Sununu from New Hampshire, Mr. Miller from Florida, and Mr. John Shadegg, Congressman Shadegg from Arizona. I think that to get started, we will recognize Mr. Miller. Congressman Miller from Florida can proceed. STATEMENT OF THE HON. DAN MILLER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA Mr. Miller. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me thank you for having this hearing. It is a special week for you, I think because the President announced earlier this week, and CBO will be announcing tomorrow, that we are going to have the first real budget surplus in 25 years. This is something I know you have been working on in your now seventh year in the Budget Committee so it has to be a very satisfying week for you. However, what I am here to talk about is the corporate welfare program, the sugar program, which I call the sugar daddy of corporate welfare. It is a program that is bad for consumers; it is bad for taxpayers; it has cost jobs that are lost in this country. It is bad for the environment and it is really bad economic and trade policy. Basically the way the program works is we can't grow enough sugar in the United States so we have to import sugar. But we restrict the amount of sugar that is brought into this country to maintain a high price of sugar. The price of sugar in the United States is over four times the world price. You can go to Canada and you can buy sugar today for about five cents a pound. In the United States we pay over 20 cents a pound for sugar. The price of sugar has been maintained at that rate for the past many years because of Federal policy. It is something I say costs a lot for the consumer. Now, we passed a farm bill back in 1995, and it was a very good program. We really reformed a lot of agriculture. I think it was one of the major pieces of legislation this Congress passed over the past several years because it did reform some antiquated programs. However, the sugar was one program that was barely changed. This program costs the American consumer over a billion dollars a year. Sugar is used in everything from cereal and candy. It is a regressive type of tax too, so it is something that costs consumers and is going to cost the Federal Government because we are major purchasers of food products whether it is in food stamps, veterans hospitals, the WIC program and such. It is corporate welfare because 42 percent of the benefits goes to 1 percent of the growers. In my home State of Florida, two companies control 75 percent of the sugar. So it is not like you have a little family farmer in the sugar business. One family has over $65 million a year benefit from the sugar program, according to the GAO estimates. This is not only corporate welfare in the United States, it is corporate welfare around the world because we give quotas to other countries. So if someone grows sugar in Australia where they have a free market of sugar, they sell it around the world for about a nickel a pound; however, in the United States we pay 20 some cents a pound for it. In the Dominican Republic, which has the largest of the quotas, most of that quota is controlled by the same family in Florida that is a dominant sugar grower in Florida. That is a corporate welfare that helps a select few people all over the globe. There are jobs being lost, first in the refinery business because we have lost sugar refineries all across the country. We had 11 of them close, good paying jobs in this country because of the sugar program specifically. It also affects jobs because of companies that use sugar will not continue production in the United States. I will give you a classic case and it is from Georgia and it is a company called Bob's Candies. It is a third generation company that makes candy canes. They can't continue making them in the United States because the sugar is so expensive. They have to move them outside the United States because sugar is so much cheaper to produce them there and then bring the candy canes into the United States. Environmentally it is a costly program for Florida because of the Everglades. The sugar program creates incentives for overproduction and overutilization of the land which then creates all the damaging runoff on the Everglades. We will be announcing tomorrow a big effort to restore the Everglades. The Vice President will be up on Capitol Hill tomorrow to make the announcement but we will be spending billions of dollars over the years. In addition, this is another crazy part of the program, is the solution to the Everglades problem, is we are buying a lot of the Everglades sugar lands so we have more areas to detain the water and filter the water. We are buying the land from the sugar companies at inflated prices because of the sugar program. I mean, it makes no sense, the whole program. And then trade. I am a supporter of free and open trade and fair trade, but when we go and open up markets for our products around the world and that is what our trade policy should be is to open up markets for our products, other countries say, wait a minute, you restrict us to sell sugar to the United States. Why should we open up our products to you? We are the most open country there is on trade in the United States, in the world, and yet sugar, we restrict it. It is hypocritical of our government to be defending the sugar program and at the same time trying to say open up your markets. This is a program that's bad big government. As I say, it is bad for the consumer. It is bad for the taxpayer. It is bad for the environment and it benefits a limited number of sugar barons in this country. It is a program that we fought very hard and my colleagues here worked with me in 1995 during the authorization. We were not successful. I appreciate your support in the past, and I look forward to having the challenge one more time to finally eliminate this sugar daddy of corporate welfare. I ask that my official statement be put in the record. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Miller follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Dan Miller, a Representative in Congress From the State of Florida Chairman Kasich, ranking member Spratt and fellow Members of Congress, I am glad to be back before this Committee on which I served during the 103rd, 104th and 105th Congress. I miss my assignment on the Budget Committee and the opportunity to participate in critically important debates such as the issue of corporate welfare. I am here today to discuss the sweet deal that sugar producers are receiving under the sugar daddy of corporate welfare; the U.S. sugar program. Contrary to what the big sugar producers may tell you, the sugar program was not reformed in the 1996 Farm bill. While other farm commodities will gradually experience a phase-out of price supports, big sugar producers will continue to reap the benefits of this corporate welfare program. Through price supports, the sugar program keeps the price of sugar in the United States artificially high. By tightly limiting the amount of sugar that may be imported into the United States, and subsidizing the operations of sugar producers through Federal loans, the sugar program forces the price of domestic sugar to be at least twice as high as the price of sugar on the world market. While this is a sweet deal for sugar producers, it leaves a sour taste in the mouths of taxpayers, consumers, American workers, and the environment. GAO estimates that the sugar program costs consumers more than $1 billion every year in higher prices for food and table sugar. Jobs for American workers have been eliminated because of sugar refineries that have been forced to shut down and because of companies relocating overseas where sugar is cheaper. The environment is damaged by sugar production in Florida. The subsidized production of sugar in Florida results in phosphorous-laden run-off flowing into the Everglades, which contributes to the destruction of this fragile ecosystem. Amazingly, the Federal Government continues to subsidize sugar producers, even as Congress participates in a multi-billion dollar project to repair the damage done to the Everglades. Tomorrow, the Army Corps of Engineers will announce a long-awaited and ambitious plan to save the Everglades. Further, the sugar program harms our position with foreign governments when negotiating trade agreements. Much of the financial hardship being experienced by our nation's farmers is due to contraction of overseas markets for U.S. agricultural exports. We need to work to open the markets in foreign nations. It is hypocritical and counterproductive for the United States to protect the sugar industry while urging other countries to reduce their trade barriers. Quite simply, our negotiators must decide whether it is more important to preserve an outdated sugar program than to open markets for competitive American farm products. For the past several Congresses I have introduced amendments to the Agriculture Appropriations Bill as well as stand alone legislation to reform the Federal sugar program. This year I introduced H.R. 1850 with Congressman George Miller (D-CA). This Miller-Miller bill currently has 57 bi-partisan co-sponsors including Chairman Kasich and seven other members of this subcommittee. Senator Charles Schumer, Senator John Chafee, Senator Judd Gregg and Senator Dianne Feinstein have introduced companion legislation in the Senate. H.R. 1850 has the support of national taxpayer, consumer, and environmental advocacy groups. As my time is limited I will concentrate on the corporate welfare aspects of this program. Specifically, how the sugar program costs consumers over $1 billion dollars a year and it benefits a select few sugar producers. Moreover, I will discuss how the sugar program kills U.S. sugar refinery jobs. Costs to Taxpayers The GAO has estimated that the present sugar program costs over $1 billion per year in higher prices for table sugar and food. This cost has been confirmed by Public Voice for Food and Health Policy. Not only do higher costs affect the prices paid at the cash register, they affect the taxpayer in the costs of government. Higher food costs mean higher entitlement spending under Food Stamps or other government programs such as school lunches and Meals on Wheels. It is a regressive form of corporate welfare benefitting a select few producers while making every consumer pay more at the cash register to justify this program. The U.S. Department of Commerce has noted that the ``effect of the sugar program is similar to a regressive sales tax, which hits lower-income families harder than upper income families.'' If you support regressive taxation, then I guess you have no problem with the U.S. sugar program. If you do not favor taxing the poor more heavily, however, you should favor changes in our sugar policies. Finally, the flight of businesses out of the country due to the high domestic cost of sugar results in lost revenue at the local, state and Federal levels. Although no calculation of this lost revenue is currently available, it is significant in light of the many thousands of displaced workers. Benefit to a Select Few The GAO reported that 42 percent of the sugar programs benefits went to just 1 percent of the sugar producers in 1991 and 33 big sugar barons each received more than $1 million in extra revenues under the program. One producer even received $65 million in 1 year. Time Magazine did a story last November on the Fanjul family that outlined how the U.S. sugar subsidy has helped propel this family into the ranks of the multi-millionaires. I commend it to your reading as it fairly captures how the sugar program helps a few well connected folks while sacrificing the good of the rest of the country. I must emphasize this because you will hear; ``Don't kick farmers when they are down'' or ``the family farm needs support, not a kick in the teeth.'' Great sound bites, but totally inappropriate with the sugar program. Sugar plantations are not family farms in the normal sense of that phrase. In 1995, the USDA compared the non-cash economic benefits that accrue to farmers of various commodities thanks to government action. Wheat gets $23 per acre in government benefits, cotton farmers $87 per acre. Sugar gets $472 per acre. Moreover this artificially high price per acre of sugar acreage complicates efforts to restore the Everglades by creating an economic incentive to utilize more Everglades for sugar farming. And this benefit goes to a select few sugar barons. Jobs Lost The two main American industries adversely affected by our sugar program are sugar refineries and manufacturers of products that utilize sugar. Often, sugar refineries are unable to find a consistent and adequate supply of sugar to operate year round. The variations create economic inefficiencies and waste which result in these facilities being unable to stay in business. Moreover, refineries process sugar and require sugar cane and beet to operate. Needless to say, buying this raw material in the United States is overly expensive when compared to the world price. Why would a company buy large quanities of sugar cane at $ .22 per pound when they can buy at $.045 per pound in a foreign nation and take advantage of other favorable economic factors such as labor costs and government regulation? Accordingly, it is not hard to see why our sugar system is sending refinery jobs overseas. As recently as 1981 there were 23 sugar refineries in the United States. Today, there are only 11 refineries. Over 3,500 jobs have been lost by closures at the refineries due to a sugar program that only benefits a select few. (See Exhibit A, which follows:) [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7748.148 Similarly, manufacturers of products that rely on sugar are greatly affected by the present sugar subsidy. Ask any businessman would they rather buy sugar at 22 cents per pound or at 4.5 cents per pound and they would all agree they would like the cheaper sugar. Even with a duty that raises the cost to over 19 cents per pound when sugar is brought into America, businessmen know that 19 cents is cheaper than 22 cents. And businessmen know that they need to pack up and leave the United States if they want to get that cheaper sugar. Also, the incentive remains to move operations overseas if the company is pursuing an aggressive export strategy. I think the best example of the present sugar program driving jobs out of America is the story of Bob's Candies. Bob's Candies was the largest producer of candy canes in America. Candy canes are a very cyclical industry and are made to be a low cost candy. However, the U.S. sugar program throws large roadblocks in the way of domestic candy makers. Accordingly, Bob's Candies moved to Jamacia where sugar is much cheaper. The president of Bob's Candies recently told Reader's Digest that the company would save more than $2 million a year in raw materials if the sugar program was scrapped. This savings would enable the company to keep jobs in America and lower retail prices. Unfortunately, it just makes good business sense to go overseas to get cheaper sugar to make candy. How many Bob's Candy Canes will this Committee tolerate? Also, the Committee should note that the cost of our sugar program was a main reason why Coke and other soda companies do not use sugar in soft drinks. Sugar got too expensive. The program priced sugar out of the lucrative soft drink industry. Instead, soft drinks now use high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) which does not have the high costs and economic inefficiencies of the sugar program. Finally, I ask this committee to keep in mind the fact the sugar industry is not large in comparison to other aspects of the economy. According to USDA data there are between 40,000 and 70,000 jobs directly related to the sugar program. This is a small number compared to the 520,000 jobs in the food processing industry or the thousands of lost Everglades related tourist jobs. Congress must not blindly protect a small special interest sugar program at the expense of the greater good. Conclusion I am grateful for the Budget Committee and its willingness to stand up to the sacred cows of government. I believe sunshine on these programs is one of the greatest ways to fix the outrageous use of corporate welfare to give the select few a benefit at the expense of everybody else. The sugar program is the epitome of this system. It is a regressive system that raises the costs of goods for all consumers, it contributes to the destruction of the Everglades, it causes U.S. jobs to move overseas, and it harms American efforts to open trade markets around the world. Congress must end this sweet corporate welfare cavity. I hope any member with questions about the sugar program will feel free to contact me or my staff at any time. I urge this Committee to support the Miller-Miller bill (H.R. 1850) and all other efforts to end the sugar program. Thank you. Chairman Kasich. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized. STATEMENT OF THE HON. JOHN B. SHADEGG, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA Mr. Shadegg. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee. It is a privilege to be here with my distinguished colleagues and to speak before this committee. As many of you know, I was once a member of this committee and philosophically I still feel like a member of the committee. Under you leadership, Mr. Chairman, I think the committee has endeavored to create a smaller, less expensive, less intrusive and more responsive Federal Government, but to achieve those goals it is critically important that we aggressively seek out and eliminate wasteful bureaucratic spending and especially corporate welfare. Now, you say those words and of course anyone in the corporate world immediate becomes defensive. Many of the projects which we label corporate welfare are indeed well intended and in fact beneficial. But most importantly, I would note the private sector, not the Federal Government should be funding the bill for those projects. I would also note that it is worth some reflection by us that guided in this job as we are by the U.S. Constitution, nowhere in that great document which sets out our specific enumerated powers are we given the authority to subsidize the private sector. Mr. Chairman, the American taxpayer is being asked every day to pay more and more and a greater share of his or her earnings to the Federal Government. Families are forced to live with both spouses working just to get by and sustain their lifestyle, and I think we have seen some of the consequences of that excessive taxation burden on the families of America, particularly with the specter of the Columbine High School incident and others like it where one has to wonder if the tax burden isn't forcing families to spend too much time out of the home and not enough time at home. I think that is a new and compelling reason for you to focus your efforts on corporate welfare. I want to focus my remarks largely in the energy area and I am going to cite some examples which are well known to members of this committee. The first one of course is one that we discussed when I was on the committee, and that is the Department of Energy's fossil energy R&D plan. I would note we have had some success under your leadership on this issue. Since the Republicans took the majority of the Congress that budget has been cut by 15 percent but it is still funded at a level of over $1 million per day. Let's look at the program. It is intended to help coal, oil, and gas industries to maintain their market share by allowing them to draw on government funded research on new products and processes. And yet the Congressional Budget Office looking at the Energy Department's fossil R&D program specifically said in a report issued just-- in April of this year, Federal programs in the fossil fuel area have a long history of funding technologies that while interesting technically had little chance of commercial feasibility even after years of Federal investment. As a result, much of the Federal spending has been irrelevant to solving the Nation's energy problems. CBO went on to point out something that I think my eighth grade son in Phoenix would have figured out on his own. They pointed out that private entities are more attuned to which new commercial technology has commercial promise than would be Federal officials. Another example of wasteful corporate welfare under the DOE is the DOE's coal research and development program, and here I would point out that between fiscal year 1978 and fiscal year 1997, DOE spent $2.7 billion on coal liquefaction. It spent--it authorized to spend $10 million in fiscal year 1999. And yet the President's Commission on Science and Technology released a report in September 1997 in which the President's commission said the Department of Energy should terminate its program for the direct liquefaction of coal. A similar comparison can be made of the department's coal gasification program. Again, I believe the coal research and development program for coal gasification should be eliminated. Again we are talking about a significant commitment of money. DOE figures show that in that same time period, 1978 to 1997, $1.5 billion was spent on this program. $73.9 million was authorized in fiscal year 1998 and in fiscal year 1999 the number is 91.5 million and yet Greenwire, a respected report commenting on this program, which admires the program because of its clean technology says coal gasification is a virtual failure, pointing out that it has failed to win industry backing over the last 10 years and now comprises less than 1 percent of the current worldwide energy generation market. By contrast, private sector R&D programs in the energy field have been extremely successful. In my testimony I point out some comments on this but let me just cite one. Business Week in a report issued in November 1997 said technological advances are slashing the cost of finding, producing, and refining oil creating a new economic calculus for the oil industry. The average cost of finding and producing oil has dropped by about 60 percent in real materials in the past 10 years while proven reserves are about 60 percent greater than in 1985. Another topic of great concern to me is that of the corporate welfare in the form of the Federal power marketing associations--administrations. As I think you well know, I had introduced legislation in this area, Mr. Chairman, and it is driven by the simple point that the Federal Government should no longer be in the business of producing electrical power. I find it interesting to note, Mr. Chairman, that at a time when other parts of the world, including Eastern Europe and South America, are privatizing their electrical facilities, United States, which should be the cornerstone of the free market, continues to subsidize government owned and produced electrical power. Private utilities, by the way, have proven that they can do a more efficient job of producing hydroelectric power than the Federal Government. In a 1997 report by CBO entitled ``Should the Federal Government Sell Electricity?'', CBO found the inadequate maintenance of power assets and resulting low use of power generating capacity show how high the cost of Federal power is. And then they made this particular point. Over the past 5 years, non-Federal dams produced an average of 20 percent more electricity per unit of capacity than did dams supplying the power market administrations. As you know, Mr. Chairman, there are five of these organizations, Bonneville, Alaska, Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western. As you also know, we privatized the Alaska Power Administration already. Bonneville is a special case because it is burdened by nonfunctioning nuclear facilities. But that leaves three PMAs which are prime candidates for privatization, SEPA, SWPA, and WAPA. Privatizing those marketing--those power administrations would accomplish a number of important goals. First, it would get the Federal Government out of the business of producing electrical power. While low cost government provided electricity may have been justified at one point in time for economic development in the 1930's and 1940's, it no longer is necessary. And it doesn't make sense. The PMAs are now subsidizing power in such wealthy areas as the suburbs of Los Angeles, the City of Las Vegas, Silicon Valley, and such resorts as Vail, Colorado, and Hilton Head, South Carolina. Everyone is aware of the absurdity of asking Americans across the country who live in less prosperous communities to subsidize the electric rates of those who live in the area serviced by the PMAs. It would also save Federal taxpayers tens of thousands, indeed millions, indeed hundreds of millions of dollars. The three PMAs I have identified cost the American taxpayers approximately $300 million each year. And this year alone the Senate has proposed in its energy and water appropriations earmark to increase funding by $92 million above the current budget request for those three authorities. I think this can be done. I think it can be done following concepts which would benefit all of the country. The greatest obstacle to privatizing the PMAs is to overcome the objections of those now getting cheaper electrical power, but I think it is important to note that while 24 percent of the American public benefits by current low rates, the remaining 76 percent of Americans pay for those subsidized rates. I would simply quickly point out that the fear of the current PMA customers that their rates will go up is one of the largest obstacles that we have to privatizing the PMAs. And yet other countries around the world have overcome these kinds of concerns. The bill I drafted was built on the success of the Czech Republic, which used a system called voucher privatization. Under voucher privatization those with vested interest in the government owned entity are given a voucher which can be traded for stock. As a result of that, the people currently benefiting from cheap public power would stand to benefit from the sale of the entity because they would own a portion of it. Now, the Czech government used this and it succeeded in moving from an economy that was 96 percent publicly owned at the fall of communism to where 64 percent of the entire economy had been privatized in 5 years by building public support for the privatization of public entities. The legislation lays out how we can achieve that goal and I would strongly urge you to take a look at it. Let me simply conclude with some general remarks about the Department of Energy. It is indeed I believe a classic example of a wasteful bureaucracy. In the materials you have been given there is a number of stories, but one I particularly like is a story of a program where the Disney organization, Walt Disney, is working in a project sponsored by Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico. We as a taxpayer are kicking in slightly over $300,000 to help the Disney Corporation find a better way to launch the 3,000 rockets it launches each night as they close down the facilities at Disney Land. Now, I have been there, Mr. Chairman, and I enjoy the fireworks display but I am hard pressed to understand why the taxpayers of America should be subsidizing Disney's research. It only made, I believe, 11--$1.1 billion last year as its profit. In my testimony, Mr. Chairman, I also cite President Clinton's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, which just issued a scathing report on the weapons labs, the adequacy of the measures that have been taken there to respond to the security threat. Fundamentally, it found that there was 11 team management structures which was incapable of performing itself and described DOE as a dysfunctional bureaucracy. Those are not my words, Mr. Chairman. They are the recommendations of the President's own advisory board. Again, I applaud you and the members of this committee for holding this hearing and I urge you to be relentless in going after corporate welfare and wasted bureaucracy. [The prepared statement of Mr. Shadegg follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. John B. Shadegg, a Representative in Congress From the State of Arizona Mr. Kasich, members of the Budget Committee, thank you for allowing me to testify today. As most of you know, I was previously a member of this committee, and I continue to feel like a member of the Committee. During my tenure in Congress, this committee, led by Chairman Kasich, has endeavored to create a smaller, less expensive, less intrusive, and more responsive federal government. To achieve these goals we must aggressively seek out and eliminate, wasteful, bureaucratic spending, especially ``corporate welfare''--that is, subsidies to private sector endeavors that the federal government has no business supporting. Before I go any further, let me be clear. Many of the projects funded by ``corporate welfare'' may be beneficial. However, the private sector--not the federal government--should be footing the bill. I believe in the Constitution, and nowhere in that great document is the federal government authorized to subsidize the private sector. Our country was founded upon freedom. When the federal government begins replacing freedom and individual initiative with government subsidies, we begin to lose the spirit and brilliance of independence, relying on government bureaucracy instead of individuals. Today, you have heard from my colleagues Mr. Sununu of New Hampshire and Mr. Miller of Florida. Their testimony on the sugar subsidy and various programs within the Department of Commerce focused on just some of the many examples of corporate welfare which riddle the federal budget. As just one example, as of FY 96, the federal government has spent more than $1.6 billion on the Advanced Technology Program, which subsidizes for-profit corporations, research institutions, and joint ventures. The General Accounting Office recently found that 63 percent of ATP applicants never even sought private sector funding before applying for government aid. Grant recipients include multi-million dollar companies that, on average, have research and development budgets of $3.5 billion. Such ``needy'' grantees include: IBM: $111,279,738 General Motors: $82,134,245 General Electric: $75,449,636 Ford Motor Co. $66,457,718 Sun Microsystems $50,113,692 Texas Instruments $45,545,315 Sarnoff Corporation $38,270,692 United Technologies $37,011,925 Phillips $36,518,925 (Source: MSNBC study of data provided by ATP, 1997) Mr. Chairman, with American taxpayers paying an ever increasing share of their earnings to the federal government, with families forced into having both spouses work just to get by and sustain a decent standard of living, we can no longer defend this level of wasteful spending on some of the wealthiest companies in the world. Indeed the Commerce-Justice-State-Judiciary Appropriations Subcommittee's report stated it well: ``in an era of scarce federal research and development dollars, funding ATP is simply a low priority.'' (Report to accompany HR 1274, 1997) This is a gross example of misdirected federal dollars. Let me turn briefly to corporate welfare related to energy. The Department of Energy is a Feeding Trough for Corporate Welfare fossil energy r&d One specific example of wasteful corporate welfare at the Department of Energy is the Fossil Energy R&D program. Although it has been cut by 15 percent since Republicans assumed the majority in 1995, it was still funded at $365 million in FY 97. That's more than one million dollars a day! The DOE markets this program as a plan to ``improve the capability of the nation's petroleum industry to produce additional supplies of clean, domestic natural gas and oil.'' The Fossil Energy R&D program is intended to help the coal, oil, and gas industries maintain their market share by allowing them to draw on government funded research on new products and processes for the commercial market. Its activities range from research in universities and national laboratories to applied R&D and company specific technology development and demonstration activities. In April of this year, however, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) stated the following about Fossil R&D: * * * Private entities are more attuned to which new technology has commercial promise than are federal officials. Federal programs in the fossil fuel areas have a long history of funding technologies that, while interesting technically, had little chance of commercial feasibility, even after years of federal investment. As a result, much of the federal spending has been irrelevant to solving the nation's energy problems * * * [In addition] because energy prices are low, potential users of such technology have little incentive to invest in implementing it. Consequently, the technology developed by the program may well sit on the shelf until it becomes obsolete. (CBO, April 1999) The President's own advisors have criticize elements of DOE's coal research and development program. As yet another example of misspent federal dollars, the DOE spent $2.7 billion on ``coal liquification'' research and development between fiscal years 1978 and 1997. In fiscal year 1998 the program received approximately $10 million; in fiscal year 1999 the request is for $7.3 million. Yet according to the President's Commission on Science and Technology report on Federal Energy Research and Development of the Challenges of The Twenty First Century [PCAST], released on September 30, 1997 ``The Department should terminate * * * direct liquefaction of coal.'' Likewise, ``coal gasification'' is another area of coal research and development which should be eliminated. According to DOE figures, $1.5 billion has been spent on coal gasification research and development between fiscal year 1978 and fiscal year 1997. Coal gasification funding was approximately $73.9 million in FY 98, and FY 99 funding was near $91.5 million. Yet even Greenwire reported in October 1997 that coal gasification was a virtual failure. It reported that ``Coal gasification. * * * has failed to win industry backing over the last ten years and now comprises less than 1 percent of the current world wide energy-generation market.'' By contrast to these wasteful, government funded programs, even the Clinton Administration has acknowledged the importance of private sector research and development in the energy field. PCAST stated: ``In the private sector, energy R&D has been an important engine of progress, enabling firms to improve their products and invent new ones, so as to increase their shares of existing markets, establish and penetrate new ones, and maintain or increase performance while reducing costs.'' And, a November 3 1997, BusinessWeek article made it clear that companies are moving forward on fossil R&D: Technological advances are slashing the costs of finding, producing, and refining oil, creating a new economic calculus for the oil industry. * * * The average cost of finding and producing oil has dropped about 60 percent in real terms in the past 10 years, while proven reserves are about 60 percent higher than in 1985. And these official figures far underestimate the amount of accessible oil in the ground. Another specific example of the Department's corporate welfare subsidies is the Energy Conservation R&D program. While the program has seen some cuts over the last few years, it should be eliminated altogether. In 1997 Congress appropriated nearly $400 million to finance corporate market development and product promotion programs. One of these programs, ``Building America'' pays for start-up costs and promotional activities for groups that want to promote energy efficient buildings. Included within the program was money for DOE to enter into licensing agreements with the world's largest air conditioning manufacturers to market a new heat pump. In return, these companies stand to make millions of dollars from this improved product with no payback to the taxpayer. the pmas should be privatized One area of corporate welfare about which I feel very strongly is the Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs). Simply put, the government should no longer be in the business of producing electrical power. And, private utilities do a more efficient job of producing hydroelectric power than the government. In its 1997 report, Should the Federal Government Sell Electricity? CBO found: The inadequate maintenance of power assets and the resulting low use of power-generating capacity show how high the cost of supplying federal power is * * * One consequence * * * is an inability to generate and transmit power at [intended] capacity * * * Over [the past five years], non-federal dams produced an average of 20 percent more electricity per unit of capacity than did dams supplying the power marketing administrations. In the 1930's, the federal government began building a number of dams, primarily in the West and South as a way to stimulate the economy during the Great Depression and promote regional economic development. The dams were built primarily for flood control, irrigation and navigation. It was also recognized that these dams had tremendous potential for generating electricity. To market this electricity, the federal Power Marketing Administrations were created corresponding to different regions of the country where the dams are located. There were originally five of these agencies: Bonneville, Alaska, Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western. Recently, Alaska has been privatized. The largest, Bonneville, is a special case, financed in a different way and, alone amongst the PMAs because it includes a number of non- functioning nuclear facilities. This leaves three PMAs as prime candidates for privatization: Southeastern (SEPA), Southwestern (SWPA), and Western (WAPA). Privatizing SEPA, SWPA, and WAPA would accomplish a number of important goals. First, it would get the federal government out of the business of producing electrical power, a sector of the economy in which it does not belong. While low-cost, government-provided electricity may have been justified for economic development during the 1930's and 1940's, it is not necessary today. Many of the once rural and undeveloped areas which benefit from this low-cost power have grown into thriving areas. These include suburbs of Los Angeles, the city of Las Vegas, and ski resorts such as Vail, Colorado. There is simply no justification for forcing federal taxpayers across America, many of whom life in less prosperous communities, to subsidize the electric rates for those who live in areas serviced by the PMAs. Privatizing would also end the constant drain imposed by the PMAs on the federal treasury. Perhaps a more fitting term would be a hemorrhage of the national treasury. According to the General Accounting Office, these three PMAs cost the American taxpayers approximately $300 million each year in unrecovered costs and financial subsidies. This year alone, the Senate's version of the Energy and Water Appropriations bill for FY 2000 added $39,594,000 to the Southeastern Power Administration above the budget request, allowed for an additional $60,000 above budget request for operation and maintenance at Southwestern Power Administration, and provided an additional $52,084,000 above the budget request for Western Area Power Administration. In fact, the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations bill earmarks a total of another $92 million above the budget request for regional power authorities. In addition to ending the constant financial drain, privatizing the PMAs would enable the American taxpayers to realize a return on the investment which they have put into the PMAs over the years. It would do so by bringing in a significant amount of revenue to the federal treasury, revenue which could then be used for debt reduction or tax relief. Under legislation I introduced in the 105th Congress, privatization would accomplish a fourth vital goal: it would directly benefit the consumers of PMA generated power. Presently, approximately one quarter of Americans get some portion of their electricity from PMAs. While these consumers may have benefitted from the PMAs in the form of lower electric rates, the legislation I introduced, unlike any other bill before Congress, would ensure that they would also benefit from their sale. As Congress and the states debate deregulating the electric utility industry, it is important to point out that one of the basic premises of a free market in electricity is a level playing field for all utilities. The PMAs pose yet another problem here. PMAs are required by law to sell power to their preference customers at a price close to the cost of production. This is an artificially low price. Not only is it lower than private utilities can match (since the government is required to not make a profit) but, according to the General Accounting Office, this price has typically not covered all of the costs associated with the PMA. The beneficiaries of these artificially low prices are called the preference customers, which are typically rural electric cooperatives and municipally owned utilities. They are able to buy power from the PMAs at artificially low rates, then distribute and resell the power at higher rates to residential and commercial consumers. Because preference customers can buy power from the PMAs at an artificially low price, these preference customers have an unfair advantage over private utilities which must pay higher prices for their power. By providing cheap power to the preference customers, PMAs undermine the transition to the free market. The PMAs also often discourage efficiency. They and their customers do not need to be efficient to compete because they get low cost, subsidized PMA power regardless of the efficiency of their operations. The PMAs are inherently inefficient because, as part of the government, they have no incentive to be efficient. The preference customers serve approximately 24 percent of the American public. The remaining 76 percent of Americans do not receive any benefits, either direct or indirect, from PMAs, but must subsidize the lower rates for the preference customers through their tax dollars. To solve the PMA problem, I have proposed a three step plan to privatize the Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western PMAs. This plan grew out of a report which I coauthored entitled Lights Out on Federal Power. In this report, we examined not only the benefits of PMA privatization but also how to achieve this in a way which would turn the current users of PMA power from potential opponents of privatization into enthusiastic supporters. The essential difficulty which this report identifies and which must be addressed before any PMA privatization plan will work is the fear of current consumers of PMA power that privatization will cause a significant increase in their electric bills. To address this concern, we examined the experiences of other countries which were faced with the task of privatizing state owned industry. It is curious that, at a time when other parts of the world including Eastern Europe and South America are privatizing their electric facilities, the United States-- the cornerstone of the free market--continues to subsidize government- owned power. The approach used by the Czech Republic to privatize state owned industry is the option most likely to enlist the support current PMA consumers. With the fall of Communism, the Czech Republic faced a significant problem. How could an economy in which 96 percent of business assets were owned by the government be privatized in such a way that would gain the support of a majority of the people? The method which the Czechs developed is one called ``Voucher Privatization.'' Each citizen was allowed to purchase vouchers which could be exchanged for shares of the enterprises being privatized. Enterprises being privatized were sold at auctions in which people were able to bid on shares in the enterprises and pay for them with their vouchers. The price of the vouchers was purposely set very low (around $40) relative to the expected value of the shares (around $1,200) to enable individual citizens to make a significant profit. This approach generated very high levels of public support for privatization. Most Czech citizens took part and most obtained shares worth much more than their vouchers. In using this approach, the Czech government accepted the fact that it would realize a smaller gain from privatization than it would through a sale to the highest bidder. They recognized, however, that it was better to build public support for privatization by allowing ordinary Czechs to directly benefit. The result was extremely successful. The Czech Republic succeeded in privatizing 64 percent of its economy between 1990 and 1995 and did so with the overwhelming support of its citizens. During the 105th Congress, I introduced this plan as H.R. 296. An updated version of this legislation will be introduced shortly. First, as a transition step, the legislation establishes three government corporations which correspond to the three PMAs being privatized. Second, it directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue warrants to the end-use consumers of the three PMAs. These warrants are the heart of the plan and correspond to the ``vouchers'' issued by the Czech government during its privatization. These warrants entitle each end-use consumer to buy shares of stock in the government-owned corporation at a low fixed price called the ``strike price.'' This ``strike price'' allows end-use consumers to make money by either purchasing shares for less than their free-market value or by selling the warrants to others. The gains for consumers of PMA power vary depending upon what percentage of their power comes from a PMA but should be enough to cover potential rate increases. For example, the average residential consumer of SEPA would receive $179, SWPA would realize $402, and WAPA, including households in Arizona, would receive $156 under this legislation. As consumers of larger amounts of PMA-generated power, commercial and industrial customers would receive a greater number of warrants and would therefore realize even larger amounts. The third step is the sale of stock in the three government corporations to the public. Once 60 percent of stock in each corporation is in private ownership, its status as a government corporation ends and it becomes a private corporation. PMA privatization is a reform which is long overdue. While previous Congresses were able to avoid the technical complexities and political difficulties of addressing the issue, the upcoming deregulation of the electricity market makes the PMA problem impossible to ignore for much longer. Deregulation is not a question of ``if,'' it is a question of ``when.'' In this world of free market competition, PMAs are a harmful anachronism. It is our duty in Congress to tackle this problem and change PMAs from an impediment to a useful element of the free market. the doe is incapable of reform Finally, I would like to address the overall issue of the Department of Energy. I have long been a supporter of the proposal by my colleague, Mr. Tiahrt of Kansas, who has introduced legislation to abolish the DOE in the past three Congresses. The Department of Energy is a wasteful bureaucracy without a true sense of mission. Founded on the heels of the energy crisis of the 1970s, the Department's energy-related functions now account for only 10 percent of its budget. Even the GAO talks about the scattered function of the DOE. In a 1995 report to Congress, GAO stated ``almost from the time of its creation in 1977, DOE has been in transition.'' GAO has also said that the agency is ``burdened by mission overload'' and has a ``diminishing sense of purpose.'' Yet while the agency has struggled and floundered, its budget has grown by 235 percent in the last 20 years. Furthermore, the DOE has developed into a feeding trough for corporate welfare recipients. Over the last four decades, Congress has appropriated $50 billion in grants and research money, much of it directed towards energy R&D. Most recently, the ineffectiveness of the DOE and the National Laboratories has grown to dangerous levels. The Cox Report showed that critical security breaches and a lack oversight have resulted in the transfer of sensitive missile technology to the Chinese government. In light of these discoveries, I am more committed than ever to doing away with this department. In March 1999, President Clinton asked his Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board [FIAB] to undertake a review of, and issue a report on, the security threat at the Department of Energy's weapons labs and the adequacy of the measures that have been taken to address it. On June 18, FIAB issued its report. The findings of the panel, headed by former Senator Warren Rudman (R-NH), were scathing. For example: ``The * * * Panel found a large organization saturated with cynicism, an arrogant disregard for authority, and a staggering pattern of denial.'' The ``Panel has concluded the Department of Energy is incapable of reforming itself--bureaucratically and culturally--even under an activist Secretary.'' ``The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy.'' ``* * * the Board is extremely skeptical that any reform effort, no matter how well-intentioned, well-designed, and effectively applied, will gain more than a toehold at DOE, given its labyrinthine management structure, fractious and arrogant culture, and the fast- approaching reality of another transition in DOE leadership.'' ``The current form of the Department took shape in the first year of the Carter administration through the merging of more than 40 different government agencies and organizations, an event from which it arguably never recovered.'' The report concludes that the weapons complex is so permanently flawed that significant change must occur. Mr. Chairman, these are not my words. They are the recommendations of the President's own Advisory Board. While the elimination of the Department of Energy may not exactly qualify as ``corporate welfare,'' the savings realized by doing so would be significant. Instead of continuing to reward a broken, fundamentally flawed system, we should eliminate it altogether. Continuing to fund the Department, its many and scattered missions, and its wasteful programs has not yielded positive results. It is a clear example of a bloated and inefficient government organization that has grown unruly and out of control. Mr. Chairman and Members, I applaud you for holding this hearing and urge you to be relentless in your efforts to end wasteful ``corporate welfare'' and inefficient federal bureaucracies wherever possible. We must begin to shrink the size of the federal government and I can think of no better place to start than the ``corporate welfare'' at the Department of Energy. Thank you. Chairman Kasich. I want to really compliment the gentleman for his testimony. I would recommend to the gentleman that he distribute that. I don't know if the whole testimony but maybe summarize and distribute it to the Congress on the issue of the Department of Energy because I think earlier when I suggested that that department didn't need to exist, the question is, well, how will we do these various functions? There are some functions you are going to keep. The question is do you need everything in order to keep the vital functions? Can you get rid of the things that you don't need? And I think your testimony was--it was excellent. I think the membership needs to know about it and they need to know precisely how we can make this Department of Energy a lot more efficient and I think you laid out program by program some of the things that should go. And of course since you are all members of the Appropriations Committee, I hope you will be prepared for my question about why don't any of these things go. I thought you were on Appropriations, John. Mr. Shadegg. No, Commerce. Chairman Kasich. The gentleman from New Hampshire is recognized. STATEMENT OF THE HON. JOHN E. SUNUNU, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE Mr. Sununu. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It is a pleasure to be here today. I would like to do a couple of things, offer some comments of my own about the Department of Commerce but also to present testimony on behalf of Representative Ed Royce. Ed is the principal sponsor of legislation to dismantle the Department of Commerce and take the operations and streamline them, consolidate them, and in some cases give them more independence. But as a cosponsor of that legislation I fully recognize that so much of what the Department of Commerce does isn't pro business at all. Critics often point out, well, if you want to dismantle the Department of Commerce, you must not be supportive of the business community or economic growth and opportunity. It is just the opposite. The pro economic growth position is to stop the kind of distortions and incentives we have out there that work against efficient markets and that Mr. Nader in our previous testimony testified to at length. As Members of Congress, we really have to remind one another from time to time that all things don't flow from Washington and that every conceivable human endeavor doesn't need a department here in Washington to manage its activity or guarantee its continued vitality. Oftentimes it is not just unnecessary but it can even be harmful and the Department of Commerce is an excellent example of that case in point. According to its own inspector general, the Department of Commerce has evolved into ``a loose collection of more than a hundred programs delivering services to about a thousand different customer bases.'' The GAO says that the department has ``the most complex web of divided authorities and shares its mission with at least 71 other departments, agencies, and offices.'' a former Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Robert Mosbacher, says that the department is ``nothing more than a hall closet where you throw everything that you don't know what to do with.'' And we as Members of Congress need to do something about that kind of duplicative and wasteful bureaucracy. The Department of Commerce is expected to perform a task totally at odds with the American ideal of government. It determines winners and losers in our economy by distributing subsidies, incentive packages and other selectively provided benefits and that phrase ``picking winners and losers'' is one that in the series of testimony we hear today will come up over and over again. Every time a company gets a grant, whether it is for $300,000 to develop better fireworks or for $2 million to develop a better mousetrap, they are getting those funds to the detriment of another firm that didn't get the money. Every time we choose one industry, whether it is steel or aluminum or textiles or electronics to receive these special grants, that is to the detriment of another industry that didn't get the money. It is anticompetitive and quite frankly it is no exaggeration to say it is un-American. As much as $695 million was spent last year by just three of the department's many subsidy programs, the Advanced Technology Program, the Economic Development Administration, and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. And notwithstanding the fact that these programs have important words in their title, like technology or manufacturing or economic development, that belies the fact that they are choosing these winners and losers. Corporate X gets the money but corporate Y does not. Industry A gets the money but industry B does not and therein lies the nature of the anticompetitive practices. Supporters of the departments assert: ``Well, this is really a small percentage of the Federal Government and it really isn't much money.'' But it is a lot of money. It is a tremendous amount of money. More importantly, it is money that is earned by the American taxpayers, sent to Washington, and then distributed by Federal bureaucrats. Essentially we are asking hard working families to subsidize businesses which oftentimes aren't even producing products that are worthwhile, as in the cases that Mr. Shadegg mentioned, where not just millions but billions of dollars have been spent for technologies that never even came to fruition. Finally this $695 million is siphoned away from productive investment so that bureaucrats or oftentimes politicians in Washington can dole out favors or take credit for job creation. Every dollar that is taken by Washington in taxes so that bureaucrats can determine who gets subsidized is one less dollar that that individual or family has or small business has to invest in their well-being, their own economic development, economic future that is competitiveness that is driven by free market. Government handouts also penalize successful companies by forcing them to subsidize their competition. I spoke about this earlier. Company X is paying taxes but if they don't get a grant, they don't get the benefit and company Y does. They are essentially paying to have their competitors strengthened. A few years ago there was one company that had developed a video compression technology after years of investment and research and development. Once the technology began to take off and the company started making a profit, the Department of Commerce funded one of their competitors through the Advanced Technology Program to develop the exact same or competing technology. Defenders of these subsidies claim that they are necessary because the programs they fund aren't adequately pursued by private investors because they are high risk. T.J. Rogers, however, who is the founder of Cypress Semiconductor, has noted that the ``high risk argument that is used by the Department of Commerce is usually justification to subsidize poor investments.'' High definition TV is one of the clearest examples of the failure in these government targeted handouts. Japanese businesses with subsidies from the Federal Government in Japan that totaled over a billion dollars in the late 1980's sought to help and nurture and encourage the high definition television market using the current existing analogue technology. And the French government did the same. Between the two of them, they invested over $2 billion in a government sponsored program to standardize the high definition technology around a government chosen practice. In the United States we denied the $1.2 billion that was being sought in subsidies and the argument for needing the $1.2 billion was we had to do what the Japanese were doing or we had to do what the French were doing. But the fact is that the digital technology that was ultimately developed by private markets, by American firms, made the government sponsored technology in Japan and France completely obsolete. As a result, as the high definition market--or when the high definition market--fully develops, the American standard developed by a private consortium is going to be the market winner. That is how private markets work. That is how competition works. And that is why we need to end the distortions in the private market that these subsidies create. Subsidies also fuel high taxes and drive high taxes. They are directly related. Higher taxes, more subsidies. And as we have the need for higher and higher subsidies, we reach out to the taxpayer to pay more and more of a share of their income. In 1993 the largest tax increase in history was passed and in 1994, the Advanced Technology Program received its highest level of funding ever. Increasing the tax burden on American families and industry so that bureaucrats can give something back to the politically powerful is not right. Mr. Nader talked about the moral implications of penalizing those that are most in need so that we can hand out Federal subsidies and it is especially worth noting that although the Advanced Technology Program has fortunately seen a reduction in funding since 1995, their funding has gone from $450 million a year to under $200 million a year in the last 4 years, I haven't seen any sharp curtailment in the American productivity. In fact, it has been just the opposite. American productivity continues to increase. Unemployment is lower. So it is a completely false argument that this program or any other Federal plan is necessary to instill competition in private markets. The way to enhance competitiveness in productivity is to minimize government interference, lower the tax burden on investment, reduce the tax rates and lower the regulatory burden. Tim Draper, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, flatly states that ``government subsidies, winners and losers selected by non-market forces simply distort the market.'' The government's job should be to create the best possible economic climate and to let business and industry do what it does best, which is to create economic opportunity. Good public policy isn't about political distribution of resources but about maintaining rules that allow the exchange and production and distribution of good ideas and good products. In short, we must allow the free market to work. It is the individuals voluntarily investing their own money that drives progress and economic growth, not government subsidies or corporate welfare. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for your time. [The prepared statement of Mr. Royce follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Edward R. Royce, a Representative in Congress From the State of California I would like to thank the committee very much for the opportunity to testify today. ``The policy of the American government is to leave their citizens free, neither restraining nor aiding them in their pursuits.'' With those few words, Thomas Jefferson articulated the premise of the Constitution and the genius of our political and economic system. Freedom and justice require government to be a neutral body that applies the law equally. The preamble of the Constitution outlines the premise of the document and states that it is to ``promote the general welfare.'' This is quite different than distributing selected benefits. As Members of Congress, we have to remember that all things do not flow from Washington, nor does every conceivable human endeavor need a department in Washington to manage its activity or guarantee its continued vitality. Not only is it unnecessary, it's harmful. The Department of Commerce is a perfect example. According to its own Inspector General, the Department has evolved into ``a loose collection of more than 100 programs delivering services to about 1,000 customer bases.'' The General Accounting Office says the Department has ``the most complex web of divided authorities,'' and ``shares missions with at least 71 Federal departments, agencies, and offices.'' Former Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the Department is ``nothing more than a hall closet where you throw everything that you don't know what to do with.'' The Department of Commerce is expected to perform a task totally at odds with American ideas of government--determining winners and losers in our economy through subsidies, incentive packages and other selectively given perks. In other words, political influence is what drives rewards rather than competence in providing goods and services to customers. The Department claims to be an advocate of America's small business community, yet it routinely competes with small businesses by providing products, administrative support, and specialized weather and mapping services that are readily available in the private sector. $695 million was spent last year by just three of the Department's many subsidy programs; the Advanced Technology Program, the Economic Development Administration and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. Supporters of the Department assert that this is a small percentage of the Federal budget and isn't much money. First, it is a lot of money. Second, it's money earned by the American taxpayer before it was taxed and given away. And third, it's $695 million dollars siphoned away from productive investment so that Washington can dole out favors. Every dollar taken by Washington in taxes so that bureaucrats can determine who gets subsidized is one less dollar that can be invested in promising technology. T.J. Rogers arrived in California with $700. He founded Cypress Semiconductor in 1983 which now employs over 2,000 people and is worth well over $1.5 billion. I would argue that the $700 invested by the person who owned it will prove to be more productive than the $695 million that was given away in subsides. Government handouts also penalize successful companies by forcing them to subsidize their competition. Promising technology and companies are well funded by private investors. Poor investments and less- promising companies can't attract private investment, so they seek government subsidies instead. This forces the successful companies who have paid their dues, taken risks and incurred losses for many years to subsidize their competition with their tax burden. A few years ago, a company had developed video-compression technology after years of investment in R&D. This new technology promises to reshape picture transmission for television, computers and the internet. Once the technology began to take off and the company started making a profit, the Department of Commerce funded one of their competitors through the Advanced Technology Program to develop the same technology. Defenders of these subsidies claim that they're necessary because the programs that they fund aren't adequately pursued by private investors due to their high degree of risk. T.J. Rogers notes that the ``high-risk'' argument used by the Department of Commerce is usually justification to subsidize poor investments. He points out that the important evaluation is about the return on investment (ROI), not risk. Using this analysis shows that investments with high risk and ordinary or low return are those that are given subsidies. Investments with a good return are enthusiastically supported by private investors because they are seen as a wise use of their money. On the other hand, those that are considered poor investments are given government subsidies. High-definition TV is one of the clearest failures of government targeted handouts. Japanese businesses, with subsidies that totaled $1 billion in the late 1980's, sought to help HDTV using existing analog technology. The French did the same. In the United States, we denied the $1.2 billion in subsidies that some had sought to compete with these foreign rivals. American companies went on to develop an alternative technology with their own money. In Japan, HDTV was transmitted by satellite. The picture quality was only marginally better than their standard signal and special televisions were required to receive HDTV. The Japanese people responded to this massively subsidized technology by doing nothing; they refused to purchase the televisions required to receive the signal. Alternatively, the digital technology developed by the American companies made the Japanese analog system obsolete. As a result, the Japanese announced plans to adopt the American system. The Japanese and European taxpayers lost $2 billion because their governments handed out subsidies. We relied on the market, and again it showed that the market works. Economic growth and technical innovations are not a result of selective government subsidies; they are the result of the genius and insight of the American people operating in the free market. High taxes and large subsidies fuel the growth of one another. In 1993, the largest tax increase in history was enacted. In 1994, the Advanced Technology Program was funded at its highest level before or since. Increasing the tax burden on American families and industry so that bureaucrats can give some of it back to the politically powerful is not right nor is it economically beneficial (except of course to those receiving the subsidy). The way to enhance the competitiveness and productivity of American industry is to minimize government interference in the marketplace and substantially reduce tax rates and regulatory burdens. Tim Draper, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist flatly states that ``government subsidies * * * winners and losers selected by non-market forces * * * simply distort the market. This is not just a waste; it is just plain wrong. The government's job should be to let the market do its job. The best thing bureaucrats and politicians can do is leave us alone.'' Agencies like the Department of Commerce distort and harm the relationship between business and government. Much of what is called ``industrial policy'' is really little more than a political payoff to unfairly favored industries or businesses. This is not the proper role of the Federal Government nor is it right. People in America get up every day and work hard so they can provide for their families. It's just not right for their government to take that money which they earn in order to provide subsidies and special programs for multimillion- dollar corporations with their hands out in Washington. Good public policy is not about the political distribution of resources, but about maintaining rules which allow exchange, production and distribution. In short, we must allow the free market to work. It is individuals voluntarily investing their own money that drives progress and economic growth, not government subsidies. The Department of Commerce should be abolished and with it those programs which stifle innovation and fuel increased tax burdens. Today, I am introducing legislation to do just that. Thank you for the opportunity to appear today before the Committee. [The prepared statement of Mr. Rodgers follows:] Prepared Statement of T.J. Rodgers, President and CEO, Cypress Semiconductor Corp. The list of unproductive--and sometimes even ludicrous-- ``investments in government-industry partnerships,'' unnecessary subsidies and outright gifts to America's corporations by our government, is long, shameful, and very well documented. What's lacking is not another regurgitation of the evils of corporate welfare, but a Congress and president with the courage to do something about it. Stereotypes of our political parties would lead one to believe that corporate welfare is the darling of Republicans, and under attack by Democrats. But, my direct experience in testifying on corporate welfare before the House of Representatives and Senate on five occasions over a 10-year period is that Democrats and Republicans are equally to blame for the shameful corporate giveaways. (On one occasion, I was personally attacked by Rep. Herbert Klein, D-N.J., and was so offended that I offered to fly at my expense to New Jersey during the next election to campaign on behalf of his opponent: ``New Jersey voters, I am a Silicon Valley CEO who says 'no' to corporate welfare, but your congressman insists on taxing you and sending your money to Silicon Valley. '') Most Silicon Valley chief executive officers are dead-set against corporate welfare, even if it means their companies would lose government funds. (In the same congressional session in which Rep. Klein impugned my integrity and motives, Silicon Valley Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., condescendingly told the committee that she was more in touch with the desires of Silicon Valley companies than I, and that Silicon Valley did want government funding. Consequently, on my fifth trip to Congress, I took only one day to gather the signatures of 78 Silicon Valley CEOs on a statement declaring unequivocally that they did not want corporate welfare.) I am the vice-chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents the vast majority of silicon production capability in the United States. The SIA is on record opposing government subsidies for the semiconductor industry. Corporate welfare persists because many companies outside the semiconductor business, unlike most Silicon Valley companies, make a handsome living at the taxpayers expense. For example, General Electric is a large recipient of corporate welfare, and its CEO, Jack Welch, refused to sign our petition to Congress to end corporate welfare. Archer Daniels Midland of Iowa rakes in approximately $400 million a year in government subsidies of different types and earmarks part of that money for political activities focused on keeping its government funding. ADM is a big campaign contributor and a heavy funder of Sunday morning political television programs. One reason Congress has chosen consistently not to act on corporate welfare is that the states and the congressmen that represent them benefit from it. The situation is very similar to the scattering of military bases (and expenditures) around the country not for strategic, but for political reasons. Much of the corporate welfare these days comes under the ``technology'' heading. Trendy politicians for example, have taken on the Internet as a second deity. Many, if not most, government technology giveaways are unproductive or even wasteful. The unfortunate aspect of wasteful government technology largess is that it is currently drying up funding for the worthy cause of teaching hard science at our universities. At the same time the government is putting pork-barrel money into dubious corporate projects, we have a critical shortage of engineers and scientists so bad that it threatens high-technology growth. To alleviate this problem in Silicon Valley, Stanford University is currently trying to raise $300 million to create funded scholarships for science and engineering graduate students. Although Stanford certainly would not agree, I think their potential loss of government funding will be ultimately beneficial: In the long run, it will free the university system from government curriculum dictates. In general, I believe that Silicon Valley has created its wealth and miracles precisely because its chief executives refuse to engage in the competition for pork-barrel funding and rarely engage in time- consuming political activities. We watch after our businesses, and value winning in the marketplace over using the force of government (subsidies, tariffs, quotas, antitrust activities, etc.) to beat our competition. The current Microsoft antitrust litigation is an unfortunate and rare counterexample. Over the last 10 years, I have traveled at my company's expense on five occasions to testify before either the House of Representatives or the Senate on the wastefulness, destructiveness, and unfairness of the corporate welfare system. I have not been well received. After I prepared for hours and travelled for a day to testify, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, arbitrarily cut my testimony to three minutes. At the same hearing, the only other committee member present, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., didn't seem to appreciate my message against Sematech, a chip industry giveaway he supported; he did not greet me, thank me for my testimony, or even look up once from his reading material during my testimony. I gave my last two presentations on corporate welfare to a nearly empty room with only one committee member in attendance. Consequently, I now believe that I am an actor in a play that waxes eloquent about cutting corporate welfare but has no last act. If this committee is serious about eliminating corporate welfare, what to do is strikingly simple: put all pork-barrel projects in a single package and have a vote, yea or nay, to eliminate corporate welfare across the board, once and for all. It's that simple--and that hard. Executive Summary Two-hundred-twenty-one years ago, American colonists declared independence: to be free and to pursue their interests in free markets with limited government. Real Americans hated taxes. They listed as a cause for rebellion in the Declaration of Independence: ``for taxing us without our consent.'' Their new constitution limited government and banned personal income taxes. The Revolution produced the American Dream, during which the common man became better off more quickly than any other time in history. For our first 200 years, from 1776 to 1976, America's per capita income grew at the rate of 458 percent per century, versus the 3 percent per century growth rate of the pre- American world. Now, the American dream--that every generation will enjoy a higher standard of living--is threatened. Since 1976, the GDP per capita growth rate has steadily declined from 2.5 percent per year to 1.5 percent per year, and we hear people say, ``America needs a raise.'' In 1913, the 16th Amendment legalized a Federal income tax with a levy of 1 percent of GDP. Today, the American Dream is being eroded by the ever-increasing burden of federal, state, and local taxes, which consume a whopping 35 percent of our national output. Although we are at peace and without a Cold War, our government is currently spending at a higher rate than the peak 30 percent-of-GDP rate of World War I, and nearing the record 50 percent-of-GDP rate of World War II ! There is a broad consensus that government spending must be cut. Eliminating ``corporate welfare'' should be a priority in government spending reduction. The risks are minimal. Savings could reach $275 billion over 5 years. And there is a moral imperative: We should not be asking our senior citizens to tighten their belts while our government is literally subsidizing the sale of Chardonnay to the French. The current pork-barrel system of taxing and spending (read: wealth confiscation and centrally controlled redistribution) creates a downward economic spiral. With corporate taxes so high, companies must lobby for givebacks to remain competitive. Congress is consequently put under extreme pressure to ``bring home the pork'' to home-state corporations, some of which are political contributors. Payouts to those corporations then pressure the government to raise taxes, which, in turn, stimulates corporations to invent new subsidies, sometimes creatively labeled ``government investments'' or ``government-industry partnerships.'' ``Government-industry partnership,'' is Washington- speak that means Americans will be compelled to pay for some silly program like the ATP proposal to re-bioengineer cotton, making the cotton fibers more like polyester. We should choose to break out of this downward economic spiral by ending corporate welfare now. Technology subsidies to corporations are sold using technobabble to camouflage unjustifiable investments, which typically fall into four categories: Subsidizing the rich: Sematech. We gave $800 million over an 8-year period to 14 electronics companies that currently make more than $800 million in profit every month--and they don't even have to pay it back. Competing unfairly with private industry: the ATP video compression project. C-Cube Microsystems was venture funded in Silicon Valley and lost money for years before its video compression technology took off. C-Cube woke up 1 day and found a $1.2-billion-dollar rival entering its market with government funding. C-Cube's investors paid full fare. Spending that provides no benefit: Gallium arsenide wafers in space. Vitesse Semiconductor in Camarillo, California, makes some of the world's fastest chips using an exotic semiconductor called gallium arsenide. Vitesse sees no value whatsoever in the $500-million NASA plan to make gallium arsenide chips in space. Spending that hurts the intended beneficiary: European semiconductor subsidies. The European Union put a tariff on semiconductor chips to protect its fledgling chip industry. Now, the EU is removing this tariff, but not before higher chip prices decimated its computer industry. Meanwhile, European chip companies lost market share anyway. Taxes to fund government boondoggles come from two sources: from the rich who can afford to pay excess taxes, and from working people whose lives are less well off when the government takes their money. It is immoral and un-American to take money away from people who are just making ends meet in order to subsidize corporations--or anything else. Taxing the rich to fund poorly managed government programs is simply a self-destructive decision: It does nothing more than move money and investment decisions away from proven moneymakers (read: job producers) to Washington amateurs. In both cases, Americans lose. One common rationalization for corporate welfare is that Japan and Europe subsidize their corporations, compelling U.S. corporate subsidies in order to remain competitive. The rationalization is totally false. Objectively viewed, Japan's programs have been consistent losers. Western Europe's socialized economies are among the least healthy on the planet, second only to the 100 percent-socialist disasters in Eastern Europe. The choice to take money from citizens to pursue the government's ``good ideas'' is pure and simple socialism, which has been consistently self-destructive to the economies of those countries pursuing it to any degree. The damage falls on a gray scale ranging from America's first income-taxless society to the near-100 percent wealth control of the collapsed Soviet state. Our current taxes total 35 percent of GDP, in the middle of the gray scale. The best way to shut down corporate welfare is to have a ``yes'' or ``no'' vote on a package of corporate subsidies identified for elimination by an independent commission, as we did in the most recent military downsizing. Silicon Valley CEOs would support a fair package proposal to cut corporate subsidies, as attested by a list of names in an appendix to this report. The commission mechanism allows Congress to avoid the lose-lose proposition of voting either for more corporate welfare or against a subsidy to a home-state corporation. Corporate Welfare vs. the American Dream Our forefathers hated taxes. They viewed them as confiscation of individual wealth. They threatened rebellion over the Stamp Act of 1765--a British invention to raise money from the colonies by requiring a tax stamp on documents. They threw the tea into the harbor in 1773, rather than paying taxes on it. And they listed as a cause for rebellion in the Declaration of Independence: ``for imposing taxes on us without our consent.'' The Constitution turned on its head the basic premise of all prior world governments. In other countries, the king, or other sovereign, owned the land, the citizens, their property, and their wealth. People were allowed to own property and to have rights only through the grace of the king, sometimes in a formal agreement such as the Magna Carta. The American Constitution created a bottom-up country by ensuring the people's right to be free: they owned themselves, their intellectual and physical property, and their money. The markets were to be free and the new government was to be given only limited, enumerated powers. Those powers not enumerated were specifically reserved for the people. The new government made it unconstitutional to levy an income tax on individuals. The Real Americans who founded our country wanted ``the government off of our backs and out of our pockets,'' to use a Reagan phrase. This first-ever, morally profound decision to organize a country ``by the people, of the people, and for the people'' led to the most rapid improvement in the well being of the common man in history. During our first 220 years, the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of Americans grew from $60 per person in 1776 (equivalent to $919 in 1996 dollars) to $28,540 per person in 1996. Personal income per capita in 1996 was $24,296, or 85 percent of GDP per capita--most of GDP per capita falls through to personal income. GDP per capita grew at an unprecedented rate of 458 percent per century from 1776-1996, effectively doubling every 40 years. It took mankind 30,000 years to reach $919 per year, while America catapulted its citizens from $919 to $28,540 in just 220 years. Footprint of Capitalism gdp per capita (1996$) [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7748.149 Source: U.S. Gov't, Stanford University. Figure 1. GDP per capita in America rose to $28,540 in 1996 of which 85 percent or $24,296 ended up as personal income per capita, based on government statistics which go back to 1869. Another source, Another Economic View of American History, by Passell and Atack, provides the estimates for U.S. GDP per capita in 1775 as $60, equivalent to $919 in 1996 dollars. The doubling of income every 40 years gave rise to the American Dream--the expectation that every new generation in America would be better off than the prior generation. Something special happened in America in 1776: When the common people decided to stop serving government and to mandate government to serve, they prospered as never before. The Slowdown The first Americans would have scoffed--or rebelled--if the government had proposed to tax them to ``stimulate the economy'' by ``investing'' taxpayer dollars in ``government-industry partnerships.'' That type of language, Washington-speak, is the very un-American language of confiscated wealth, weakness, and usurped freedom. Ultimately, if we don't change--it will be the language of defeat. A closer examination of GDP per capita over the last 20 years, from 1976 to 1996, shows a slow down. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7748.150 Source: U.S. Gov't; 1996$, 20-yr CAGR. Figure 2. Graphing the 20-year compound annual growth rate of GDP per capita from 1976 to 1996 shows a decline in growth from about 2.5 percent per year to about 1.5 percent per year. The 2.5 percent growth rate of GDP per capita in 1976 corresponds to a doubling every 28 years. The slower 1.5 percent GDP per capita growth rate corresponds to a doubling every 46 years. The American Dream, the engine of our prosperity has not stopped, but it is slowing down. We continue to hear that the working man is not getting better off and that ``America needs a raise.'' How do we get back on track? Cut Government Spending One important factor slowing the American economy is the ever- increasing consumption of our national wealth by government. In 1913, the 16th Amendment lifted the constitutional ban on Federal income taxes. The first Federal income taxes were modest in both scope and magnitude.

The first Federal income tax in 1914 was almost insignificant in terms of the total and per capita amount paid, the percentage of GDP consumed, the percentage of the population required to pay taxes, and the complexity and size of the IRS. During the last 80 years, every aspect of the Federal income tax system has grown much more rapidly than the economy. In 1994, the personal per capita Federal income tax levy of $2,622 reached 12 percent of the $22,104 personal income of Americans. The combination of federal, state, and local taxes now supports spending which consumes a whopping 35 percent of GDP. Our government is currently consuming a higher percentage of our gross domestic product than the 29 percent spending peak of World War I! [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7748.151 Source: Harry Browne Reports, U.S. Gov't statistics. Figure 3. Government spending as a percentage of gross domestic product has increased consistently since the New Deal of the 1930's. Total spending includes federal, state, and local taxes, adjusted for the Federal exemption from state and local taxes. Even though we have no ``hot'' or Cold War in progress, government spending is near 49 percent of GDP, the all-time record set during World War II. Despite this rapid increase in tax collections, the government spent money even faster, piling up in addition a national debt of $4.7 trillion dollars by 1994, over $18,000 for every American. The interest payments on the national debt now amount to two-thirds of the entire budget of the Defense Department. It's time to cut back. Cut Corporate Welfare I believe we ought to eliminate immediately most corporate subsidies, so-called ``corporate welfare,'' which amounts to about $65 billion a year. The electronics industry would be unscathed if it lost all of its subsidies, although a few individual companies might be hurt. (Of course, it would be precisely those CEOs who would travel to Washington to make ``end of the world'' speeches.) When U.S. airlines were deregulated, removing subsidies in the form of higher fares, the industry got healthier, weak competitors were absorbed by better-managed companies, and airfare became affordable for the first time to many Americans. The airline industry is healthier and better off without subsidies. There is also a moral imperative regarding corporate welfare: unjustifiable subsidies, such as those to promote the sales of wine and oranges in Europe, should be eliminated completely before the discussion turns to asking senior citizens to endure cuts in Social Security and Medicare. Our current pork-barrel system of taxing and spending has created a vicious downward economic spiral that will be difficult to break. If two corporations are taxed at a rate of 37 percent (my company's current total tax rate), but one of them receives a subsidy equivalent to a 10 percent-point rebate, the subsidized company will enjoy visibly higher profitability, higher share price, and an enhanced ability to raise funds at a lower cost. Consequently, companies must compete for government subsidies whenever those subsidies make a competitive difference. Even though this is my seventh trip to Congress to oppose corporate subsidies, I would without hesitation pursue any important subsidies offered to my company, because it is my obligation to our shareholders to do my best for them, including obtaining any available low-cost funding. A company that failed to do so would be as foolish as an individual who refused to take income tax deductions because of a strong belief in a flat tax. The spiral continues as corporations build lobbying organizations to pressure Congress to ``deliver the pork'' to home-state corporations, which are often political contributors. As Congress succeeds in rewarding home-district corporations with their ``fair share of the government pie,'' the pressure falls right back onto the government to raise the revenue to pay out all of those subsidies. The spiral is completed, as it was in 1993, when tax revenues are raised to pay the bills by hiking taxes on corporations which then seek new and creative subsidies to offset their higher tax rates. We can use happy words like ``government-industry partnership,'' and ``effective representation'' to describe the process, but the economics of the downward spiral is precisely socialism; that is, the mandated movement of money from individuals and companies to central government control. At one extreme, when all of the assets (save those of the black market) are controlled by central government planners, we have pure, Soviet-style socialism. At the other extreme, when income taxes are illegal, we have American-style capitalism, circa 1776. That is a black-and-white representation. Today, Americans live in a gray world where the government takes and controls 35 percent of the country's yearly production. Western Europe's economies are more socialist than ours, and they show it. They have slow growth rates and unemployment rates so high that they would limit any American presidency to one term. And, of course, the socialist disasters of Eastern Europe make even the ailing Western Europe economies look great. Sometimes, it is difficult to see the obvious big picture because of incremental thinking. An increased tax of only a nickel a day per American supports a $5 billion-per-year subsidy. With easy money and companies promising breakthroughs in health care, pollution control, or electronics for ``only'' a few billion dollars, government often makes the wrong choice. The road to socialism is paved with nickels-- trillions of them--each taken from Americans with the greatest good intent. The synopses of ATP programs dazzle us with possibilities: ``next- generation video compression,'' ``high-definition television (HDTV) studio,'' ``new generation laser-based welding,'' ``less polluting, more cost efficient painting process,'' ``super-hard coatings of boron nitride,'' and so forth. All of these ostensibly compelling and cost- effective requests for corporate subsidies beg the big question: ``If you are General Motors, with annual sales of $160 billion, and $20 billion in the bank, why don't you fund this great XYZ idea yourself, and patent it?'' GM is prevalent in the ATP programs, but don't overlook Ford, Chrysler, General Electric, AT&T, IBM, Black and Decker, Honeywell, 3M, U.S. Steel, duPont, RCA, Phillips, MCI, Goodyear, Amoco, Kodak, Polaroid, Xerox, Caterpillar, Westinghouse, and Time Warner-- apparently, Bugs Bunny needs the taxpayers' money. All of these great corporations with all of their great ideas and big bucks somehow need nickels from the American taxpayer to bring their ideas to market. There are two reasons for the apparent dilemma. First, some of the projects are worthy and the big companies are simply looking for a tax rebate to get value from their extensive lobbying groups. The second reason is risk avoidance--companies want the government to help fund their long-shot projects. I believe that the ``high-risk'' argument used by the Commerce Department is usually just an excuse for making poor investments. Breakthrough ideas often involve great risk; that is, a significant chance for failure. The important evaluation is really not about risk, but about return on investment (ROI). Risky ideas can be great, if they offer huge returns. It is like gambling: A bet that has only a 1-in-10 chance is very risky, but it is a big winner if its pays 100-to-1. Conversely, a bet that wins 9 times out of 10 has very low risk, but is not worth making if it pays back only even odds. In Silicon Valley, we have become rich (San Jose has the highest per capita income in the United States) by making many very risky bets, some of which turned out to be colossal winners, like the microprocessor chip. No company in Silicon Valley has ever had the size or assets of General Motors, yet most of us have taken big risks--to get even bigger returns. Analyzing ROI rather than risk shows which poor investments get foisted off on the government: the ones which have high risk and an ordinary return. The mentality of investing ``free'' government money is straightforward: ``We would never invest our corporate money on this Edsel of a project, but if the government invests in it, great. If the Edsel succeeds, it will be a nice business; if not, we have not lost anything.'' Medium return/high-risk investments are sold to the government using technobabble. Let me give you an example. Most of you are lawyers, and I have a Ph.D. in transistor physics. On Monday, I could convince you that there is a national imperative to build ``gallium arsenide wafers in the near-perfect vacuum of space to achieve near- perfect tetrahedral crystals with very high electron mobility.'' I would convince you with a modified form of the classic ``Russian missile gap'' argument, which worked so well for the Defense Department during the Cold War. I would paint a picture of a potentially catastrophic technical threat, with which our foreign competitors could wipe out an entire American industry segment. You would support the project. (As a matter of fact, you did, as I will discuss later.) Meanwhile, on Tuesday, I could come back and tell you that my original technology calculations were in error, and that a more refined version of an existing technology--indium antimonide--could save the day. And, as a test of my skills of persuasion, I might come back on Wednesday to turn you around again based on recently published ``new data.'' Given that I were a credible scientist from a credible corporation, you would have no choice but to agree. And don't think that your technical experts could help you deal with me--they are the ones my company didn't hire. I would not even have to be dishonest or a cynic in order to mislead you. I spend many working hours exercising my skills as an engineer/businessman to figure out which one in 10 of the ideas presented to me are worthy investments for our shareholders. I often say ``no'' to well-meaning engineers in our company who are convinced that their high-risk/medium-return idea is really a medium-risk/high- return idea. Indeed, most Silicon Valley entrepreneurs don't start new companies to become techno-millionaires, but to prove their old bosses wrong, to show that their great ideas were misjudged. I founded Cypress Semiconductor Corporation 14 years ago precisely for that reason. Making difficult technology decisions professionally is what Silicon Valley is about. Whenever a dollar is transferred from San Jose to Washington, its chances of being invested in something important diminish greatly. So far we have discussed two unjustifiable forms of corporate welfare, subsidies to the rich, tax rebates for research and development that would have been done anyway, and spending for no benefit, funding low ROI programs that will never pay off. There are two other common categories: spending that actually harms the beneficiary and unfair government competition against private industry. Sematech: A Subsidy to the Rich By 1986, the Japanese were starting to take over the semiconductor industry, once dominated by American companies. The Semiconductor Industry Association lobbied for a $500-million subsidy called Sematech, a technical consortium. They used the classic arguments to justify Sematech: ``critical industry,'' ``Japan has subsidies/we need subsidies,'' and ``jobs will be lost.'' Sematech was funded, and my company inquired about joining, but the 14 Sematech charter members (12 of the 14 were billion-dollar-plus corporations) effectively excluded us and America's other 100-plus small semiconductor companies by using the mechanism of a $1-million yearly minimum membership fee. Although Sematech was sold to Congress as a consortium open to all companies willing to pay dues of 1 percent of sales, the $1 million minimum meant that a $20-million semiconductor company actually had to pay 5 percent of sales. Big companies got a break, paying maximum yearly dues of $15 million. Consequently, for a $3-billion semiconductor company, the dues amounted to 0.5 percent of sales--10 times lower than the dues paid by the small companies. That is why so few companies joined Sematech, even though it had $500 million to spread around. My battles with Sematech started when our engineers were denied access to an advanced piece of wafer-making equipment called a ``chemical mechanical polisher'' (CMP) machine manufactured by an Arizona company then named Westech. Sematech contracted Westech to develop the CMP machine and asked that the machine be held off the market and offered to Sematech members only for 1 year. The president of Westech assured me that the equipment would be on the open market and that there was no deal between his company and Sematech, but Cypress was denied access to that critical piece of wafer-making equipment, which could have differentiated between winners and losers in the next-generation technology. It was at that point I became a vocal critic of Sematech, the ``government-industry partnership'' that attacked all competitors, including American corporations like mine. There were rumors about other Sematech deals with equipment manufacturers, but Sematech assured me that there were no ``hold-back'' equipment contracts. It turns out that there really were contracts to hold back new equipment. I should say that Sematech's new president, Bill Spencer, ended that practice voluntarily. Several years later, I agreed to become an expert witness in a trial in Austin, Texas, in which Travis County sued Sematech for failure to pay local road and school taxes. Sematech had claimed on its tax exemption form that it was a ``charity.'' I used my position as a witness to subpoena documentation from them, requesting any contracts between Sematech and the manufacturers of wafer-making equipment, including Westech and others, as well as any contracts between Sematech and its own members. Sematech's lawyers were fast asleep, and provided me with a six-inch stack of contracts, including precisely the contract between Sematech and Westech Corporation to develop and manufacture a ``chemical-mechanical polisher,'' which was to be sold to Sematech members only ``for a period of 1 year after the point of normal product introduction.'' There were also other hold-back contracts. A bonus of the fishing expedition: Sematech had also granted development contracts to its own members, casting doubt on the fairness of the 50-50 ``partnership'' between its members and the government. The behavior of the Sematech members was neither illegal nor unethical. Sematech asked for and received an antitrust exemption at its formation. It used the combined resources of its members and the government to create a competitive advantage, and it did a good job of keeping its secrets away from its competitors. Sematech did what rational people do when the government gives them free money and an exemption from the rules. A few years ago, Sematech announced that it was not going to accept the last $200 million of its second $500 million grant. Based on my discussions with Sematech leaders, I know that they desired to be independent of government restrictions and not to accept government subsidies when their industry was doing better financially. Consequently, Sematech's budget was cut in half, yet its performance remained essentially unchanged. Bill Spencer changed Sematech from an expensive 800-employee manufacturing organization to a leaner research center and information clearinghouse that relies more on the manufacturing resources of its members. I believe that if Sematech had been formed as a private consortium with a smaller budget, it would have come to its current, more efficient model of operation much more quickly. But with government money, an organization can afford to be inefficient. To be fair to Sematech, I should note that the abuses I have mentioned are more than 5 years old and that the new regime at Sematech is doing a good job. Sematech's initial membership of 14 has now dwindled to 10, but the consortium appears to provide value to those remaining companies--it simply never should have been funded by the taxpayer. Sematech falls into the ``subsidies for the rich'' category because its members include Intel, Motorola, Digital Equipment Corporation, IBM, AT&T, Texas Instruments, Advanced Micro Devices, Rockwell, and National Semiconductor. These companies make enough profit every month to pay back the government's 8-year, $800-million investment. At the very least, Sematech should have been funded by a loan, not a gift from the taxpayer. Jerry Sanders, for 28 years the CEO of Silicon Valley's third biggest chip company, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), is a board member of Sematech. He would disagree with a lot of what I've said. Also, it was his company that I left to start my company. He challenged me on that issue, too. Cypress and AMD are competitors who have disagreed in court--twice--on intellectual property issues. But, Jerry and I agree on one statement, the one he and I signed at the end of this testimony asking you to cut off corporate welfare. Other Silicon Valley CEOs have also signed up. Unfair Competition: The ATP Video Compression Program Video compression is the technology that enables digital TV and small-dish satellites. Conventional television requires one satellite transponder per channel and a 10-foot dish to receive the weak analog signal. Digital TV signals are clearer, and 10 channels fit on one satellite transponder (think of the billions saved on the extra satellites that we will not need). The basic concept of video compression is that frame after frame, most TV pictures don't change much. When Dan Rather presents the evening news, he moves, but the set behind him does not, begging the question of technologists: Why not just transmit the differences from frame to frame, rather than re- transmitting the entire picture? The concept is obvious and simple, but the mathematical algorithms and special-purpose computers required to implement it are decidedly not. The leader in video compression technology is C-Cube Microsystems Inc., a quarter-billion-dollar Silicon Valley startup company, which has received an Emmy for its contribution to the television industry. C-Cube is the largest and most technologically potent company in a new industry that will reshape picture transmission not only in television, but also in computers and on the Internet. Dr. Alex Balkanski, a brilliant mathematician and businessman, is C-Cube's CEO. I am a member of its Board of Directors. Despite C-Cube's leading technology, becoming a successful business in the video compression market has been a struggle. Changing the way pictures are transmitted in a government-regulated market is a prolonged task. The venture-funded company lost money for years while waiting for its technology to take off. Shortly after C-Cube started making a profit, we were shocked to find out that the government had funded one of our competitors. An ATP grant went to LSI Logic Corporation, one of America's top-ten semiconductor companies, to help fund their effort in video compression. Perhaps LSI Logic intended to enter the video compression market anyway, so its R&D group did the heads-up thing by getting all available funds. LSI Logic's CEO is Wilf Corrigan, a friend and competitor. Wilf Corrigan and I agree on ending corporate welfare, as his signature attests. Spending for No Benefit: Gallium Arsenide Wafers in Space Gallium Arsenide (GaAs, pronounced ``gas '') is a semiconductor five to 10 times faster than silicon. GaAs chips are used to transmit data at very high speed on the so-called ``electronic data superhighway.'' GaAs chips are capable of transmitting and receiving signals on a single fiber-optic cable at the rate of 10 billion bits per second, fast enough to transmit 250,000 typed pages of information per second. The Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center (SVEC ) is billed as ``a NASA center for the commercial development of space.'' It is funded to grow GaAs wafers on space shuttle flights using a process called epitaxy. NASA's Wake Shield was designed to grow GaAs crystals behind a shield sweeping through space some 30 miles away from the contaminants surrounding the space shuttle. The theory: The vacuum in space is much better than the vacuum earthbound equipment can provide, thus offering the potential to grow more perfect crystals in space. (NASA's technobabble is award winning: ``molecular beam epitaxy'' doing ``ordered growth'' in an ``atom by atom manner'' of ``near theoretical'' atomic quality in an ``ultra-vacuum of 10-\\14\\ torr'' as part of a ``cost and time-efficient program'' which ``could be a model for future commercial space endeavors. '') The Wake Shield became one primary objective of five NASA missions. No one at SVEC would say exactly what the cost of the space wafer experiments was, but a ball-park estimate is $200 million per flight, shared among several experiments. The management of the Wake Shield claimed that although the initial wafers would be astronomically expensive, later production of GaAs wafers in space would cost only $10,000 per wafer, a number declared to be commercially viable. Congress bought off on SVEC, and at least two missions have been flown. Dr. Lou Tomasetta, the CEO of Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation in Camarillo, California, studied at MIT. He is an expert in transistor physics, data communications, and GaAs integrated circuit manufacturing. I enjoy ``tech talk'' with Lou during our monthly meetings at Vitesse, where I am also a member of the board of directors. Neither Lou nor I can figure out why our government is making GaAs wafers in space. Lou calls the program a ``solution looking for a problem.'' Vitesse is one of America's Big Three GaAs companies. Given the possibility that Lou and I were missing something, I called Steve Sharp, a Silicon Valley friend of mine who moved to Oregon to run TriQuint Semiconductor, another of the Big Three. Steve said that he was buying GaAs wafers for $175 each, and that the very highest performance GaAs wafers sold for $1,000. He said that it would be very difficult to figure out how to make money on a $10,000 space wafer. His final comment was, ``I tend to ignore this sort of request.'' In response to criticisms I published in an industry publication, Electronic News, challenging the commercial value of the space wafers, the head of the SVEC project said the wafers ``could be useful for technologies not yet developed'' and then listed numerous commercial products including CD players and optic fibers that already are on the market, with technology derived from ordinary terrestrial wafers. Maybe we are all missing something, but I think our government has taken several hundred million dollars from American taxpayers to subsidize an exotic technology manufactured in an exotic place for a super-high-tech industry that neither needs nor cares about the investment. Spending That Hurts the Beneficiary: European Semiconductor Subsidies Recently, countries with advanced electronic capabilities agreed to remove tariff barriers on a broad range of electronic products because they realize that high prices hurt everyone in the electronics industry. In an industry where life depends on fast improvement, consider the effect of the tariff that the European Union placed on semiconductor chips imported into Europe. Currently, semiconductors comprise about 20 percent of worldwide electronic shipments. In other words, the average personal computer contains about 20 percent of its value in semiconductors. Put another way, for every $1 in semiconductor sales, there are $5 in computer or home electronics sales. When the European Union decided to protect its fledgling semiconductor industry by imposing a stiff 14 percent tariff on imported chips, it also raised the price that the European computer industry had to pay for its most important raw material, chips. The EU policy to protect its small semiconductor industry had a devastating impact on its much larger computer industry. Europe's largest computer company, Great Britain's ICL had to sell a 50 percent stake to Fujitsu to stay afloat. Nixdorf, a prominent German computer company, was acquired by Siemens after a financial crisis. Italy's Olivetti, Europe's biggest PC producer, still sells PCs, but stopped manufacturing, triggering big layoffs. The market share of European computer companies as a group declined. And what happened to the fledgling European semiconductor industry while it was being protected? Its market share dropped from 10.2 percent to 5.4 percent from 1988 to 1996. In this case, government ``help'' damaged all parties concerned. The Hidden Costs of Technology Subsidies If a tax of a nickel per day per American supports $5 billion in yearly subsidies, the whole $65 billion-per-year tab for corporate welfare can be viewed as a ``mere'' 65 cents per day per American. An obvious question comes to mind: ``Wouldn't you be willing to pay 65 cents a day to make America's companies the most competitive in the world?'' While I hope your answer to that question is ``no,'' I would also like to point out that true cost of corporate welfare exceeds that cost by a lot. Consider the tax levy for corporate welfare as it applies to two groups, average Americans and rich Americans. That 65 cents per day is $237.25 per year, a nontrivial sum for the average American. That means less money in the pockets of families struggling to make ends meet: a bicycle not bought, a vacation not taken, or missing the monthly college fund payment. It is unconscionable and un- American that we would tax working families while we fund the dubious corporate subsidies I have reviewed. On the other hand, it is much easier to talk about funding corporate welfare by eliminating those ``tax loop holes for the rich'' (who pay ``only 50 percent'' of their income to the government). I am an example of one of those rich people who can afford to pay more taxes. Although I came to California with only $700, I became a founder of a startup chip company which employs over 2,000 people. My personal wealth comes from the 2 percent of the shares of our company I still own, most of them held since our founding in 1983. The market value of our company is now $1.5 billion. Two percent of $1.5 billion is $30 million. I am rich. What does it matter if the government takes an extra million dollars from me in order to fund corporate welfare or other ``good ideas''? Like many Silicon Valley people who have created wealth, I consume very little of my net worth. I'm interested in transistors, companies and competition--not yachts and airplanes. Consequently, I invest almost all of the money I have earned right back in Silicon Valley. I have already described two of the companies that I not only invest in, but help to run as a board member. There are numerous other companies that I invest in because I know what they do and why it will make a difference. In aggregate, I hold shares in over 100 companies, almost all of them Silicon Valley high-technology companies whose names you would not recognize. When Congress and the President voted to raise my personal taxes in 1993, I paid the extra amount by selling some of those Silicon Valley stocks. That money then went to Washington to be ``invested'' in ``government-industry partnerships'' related to the ``electronic data superhighway'' (at least as the PR described it at that time). The point is this: When government raises taxes on wealthy individuals, it is simply taking investment dollars from those individuals and moving them to Washington. Proven moneymakers and job creators lose control over the investment of their funds and unproven Washington amateurs take over. The real question for Americans is, ``If you had to bet the creation of your job on investment from wealthy people in the private sector versus investment from the government, which would you choose?'' The answer is obvious. Although it is good stump rhetoric to fume about ``tax breaks for the rich,'' the fact is the average American loses out every time a dollar is taxed out of the private sector. If you really want to enhance the competitiveness of American corporations, cut the capital gains tax and let me invest my own money--I'm very much better at it than government is. There is one final hidden cost of government interference in the free market: The inefficient use of human resources is the most devastating cost of all. All CEOs know one fundamental truth: that the human knowledge and energy collected in a company is what drives profit. It's not assets, or factories, or cash, but people that separate one company from another. Consequently, in Silicon Valley, we fight titanic battles to woo employees in an area where unemployment is less than 2 percent. When Cypress was a startup company, we wooed numerous employees from Intel with the lure of a more prominent position (in a very much smaller company), and the potential wealth from stock options. Intel, now the largest semiconductor manufacturer, has counter-attacked in the Valley with a new campaign promising--in writing--a Hawaiian vacation as a sign-on bonus for working at Intel. Recently, when one of our competitors, Cirrus Logic, suffered a problem in the marketplace prompting layoffs, we hired an airplane to fly over Cirrus's headquarters carrying a banner with the message that we had jobs open and listing our Internet address. Corporate welfare can have a devastating effect in an environment like Silicon Valley. While companies are fighting with salary, stock, and promotions to woo the best and brightest, the government sometimes uses corporate welfare to prop up sick companies. Consider this hypothetical case: When the automobile industry was moving from mechanical carburetors to electronic fuel injectors, what if the government decided to ``protect jobs'' in the carburetor industry by subsidizing carburetor companies? With American fuel injector companies starving for the human talent, and Japanese competitors taking market share, the government would be spending money to keep people at the failing carburetor companies in order to ``save jobs.'' Subsidizing losing companies traps people in dead-end jobs, prevents other companies from getting the talent they need, and gives our international competitors an advantage. Japan and Europe Subsidize, So Must We One of the most common-and erroneous--rationalizations for corporate welfare is a scare tactic: Foreign governments give out corporate welfare; America must do the same to remain competitive. Perhaps Europe is not an immediate threat, but what about Japan? Sematech was formed at the height of the Japanese attack on the American semiconductor industry. The American semiconductor industry dominated its market, from its origin in the '60's, through the '70's. As late as 1982, America held a 57 percent-32 percent chip market share advantage over Japan. But in the '80's fortunes reversed, and by 1989 Japan actually took a 50 percent-37 percent lead. Clyde Prestowitz, a big fan of government subsidies, wrote the book Trading Places, and testified before Congress that Japan's semiconductor subsidies, channeled through its Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), were responsible for the defeat. Prestowitz declared that the American semiconductor industry was lost to the Japanese and pondered whether or not the American computer industry could survive (both assertions were wrong). In 1993, I debated Prestowitz at the Cato Institute, where he went so far as to declare that the semiconductor industry was created by defense spending. Nothing could have been further from the truth, yet Prestowitz was presented as an expert to justify subsidies to Silicon Valley, about which he knew very little. I also debated Michael Maibach, the chief lobbyist for Intel Corporation, on public television in 1993. Maibach said that Sematech was needed to maintain the domestic supply of military chips. What if our military had to depend on Japan? It was another scare tactic used to justify corporate welfare. Even at its lowest point in 1989, America still manufactured 37 percent of the world's $49.7-billion worth of chips. The military rationalization for corporate welfare sounded OK in Washington, but it had no rational basis. I reminded Mr. Maibach that my company, Cypress Semiconductor, shipped 20 percent of its production to the military and had chips in the F-14, F-15, F-16, and F-18, as well as many of the guidance and weapons systems aboard those airplanes. My position was vindicated a few years later when Intel announced that it was voluntarily exiting the military-chip business, despite its Sematech subsidy. Cypress still ships a wide variety of chips to the military. Did MITI subsidies to the Japanese semiconductor industry hurt our chip companies? Were Japanese companies sharing secret data in a way that would violate American antitrust laws? The answer to both questions is ``no.'' In 1992, I convinced Dr. Yoshio Nishi to testify to that effect at a congressional hearing. Dr. Nishi, then the head of chip development at Hewlett Packard, had been head of the VLSI program at Toshiba, one of the few MITI-sponsored programs that seemed to work. The MITI VLSI program was targeted at entering the dynamic random access memory, or DRAM market, the biggest chip market in the world. Japan successfully entered that market en masse, causing Silicon Valley's three largest companies, Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, and National Semiconductor, to abandon the DRAM market. Intel later acknowledged that it felt it could have weathered the storm, but chose to abandon DRAMs in order to put its full force behind microprocessor development. What a great decision that was! I was working in the memory group at Advanced Micro Devices at the time. We did exit the DRAM business because we could not make money in it. We felt at the time that Japan was dumping DRAM chips into the U.S., selling them below manufacturing cost. In retrospect, I believe now that Japan simply got better at manufacturing than us for a while and was able to produce the chips at extremely competitive costs. Charlie Sporck, then president of National Semiconductor, was the father of Sematech. Sporck used the DRAM failure as a rallying cry. Dr. Nishi ran the Toshiba DRAM program, which was the most successful of the Japanese efforts. He testified that there was very little financial aid from MITI to the Japanese semiconductor industry, and also that the Japanese semiconductor companies--intense rivals-- never shared secret information, but only general ``roadmap'' information that allowed the companies to gauge the effectiveness of their programs and make sure they were headed in the right direction. Three important American semiconductor companies did remain in the DRAM race: Motorola, Texas Instruments, and then-startup Micron Technology in Boise, Idaho. TI now manufactures DRAMs in plants around the world, and Micron has grown to be a $3-billion company known to be able to outmanufacture any of its Japanese rivals. The domestic military chip supply was never in danger, and MITI had very little to do with the Japanese success in the mid '80's. Superbly managed Japanese companies simply beat us--for a while. The tables have now turned. America again leads Japan in semiconductor market share. Intel's decision to focus on the microprocessor business, combined with its excellent execution, have propelled it to become the No. 1 semiconductor company in the world. American semiconductor manufacturing capability has caught up to Japan's. Our focus on designing innovative chips has proven to be more important than Japan's focus on grinding out commodity chips at very low cost. Many of the American semiconductor companies that were very small startups at the time of Sematech's formation, my company, Altera, Xilinx, Linear Technology, Maxim, Micron Technology, LSI Logic, and VLSI Technology are now substantial semiconductor corporations with revenues from $500 million to $3 billion. These companies manufacture a dazzling variety of products. We all export to Japan. The innovativeness and resilience of the American semiconductor industry enabled it to react to the attack--and win. Although the MITI VLSI program was successful, the fact is that MITI has also wasted huge amounts of money and has many more failures than successes. For example, MITI's high-definition television (HDTV) program spent $1 billion to define and dominate the next-generation HDTV. Some American executives immediately appealed to Congress to get their corresponding piece of corporate welfare. The realities: 1) the U.S. won the High Definition Television (HDTV) race with a superior digital design, and 2) the only digital TV deployed today is not that burdensome, FCC-approved HDTV system, but a digital enhancement of ordinary television. (Prediction: I have a 2000-line, super-enhanced TV in my house that qualifies as ``HDTV,'' but uses a normal TV input signal. That system will be deployed commercially, and the expensive new HDTV being pushed on a reluctant industry by the FCC will stall; no wonder CBS and NBC want ATP grants to build the first HDTV station.) MITI caused Japanese taxpayers (who live in homes with half the square feet per person of Americans) to lose $1 billion on its HDTV boondoggle. TRON was a nickname for a Japanese advanced, fifth-generation computer partially funded by MITI that threatened to wipe out the U.S. computer industry. It turned out to be a loser, and the U.S. computer industry remains dominant. MITI support to the Japanese aircraft and biotech industries has also produced no tangible results. MITI focuses on 13 Japanese industries. The four areas of heaviest emphasis are textiles, mining, basic metals and chemicals. Despite that, these areas ranked lowly--13th, 12th, 10th, and 9th, respectively, in growth rate among the 13 industries. In response to the theory that MITI was not trying for growth in those industries, but simply subsidizing declining industries to ease their pain, Harvard economist David Weinstein stated, ``But if that is true, that makes Japanese industrial policy very like its French and American counterparts over the past four decades--politically driven, favor- based, [and] non-helpful to the nation's overall economic functioning.'' As I testified before Congress in 1995, ``Corporate welfare does not work anywhere in the world. It does not work because it penalizes a country's winners with excess taxes in order to fund that country's losers with inefficiently run government programs. `They've got subsidies; we need subsidies,' is exactly wrong. America will be much more competitive on a relative basis if we allow the nations with whom we compete to squander their taxpayers' money, while we encourage our companies to win without subsidies. It's like the Olympics: there comes the day when an athlete must walk alone into the arena of competition. The government cannot lift the weights and run the miles that are required to be a champion--only an individual can.'' The fact is that in western Europe or Japan, the choice to take money from citizens to pursue the ``good ideas'' of government has been consistently self destructive to their economies. Socialism does not work. Socialism is immoral. We should abandon socialist programs like corporate welfare. Barriers to Progress: The System and Lobbyists One of the biggest barriers to eliminating the corporate welfare drain is the pork barrel system itself: Members of Congress are put in a lose-lose situation forced to choose between voting down a significant subsidy for a home-state corporation, or voting to continue corporate welfare. Congress recently faced the same situation in the downsizing of the military. Individual senators were very reluctant to vote to close down major bases in their home state, yet everyone agreed that the Soviet collapse provided a great opportunity to reduce spending. The solution--to appoint an independent panel to collect military cuts into a single bill for a ``yes'' or ``no'' vote without amendments--turned out to be a winner. It got the job done, and even in California where we were hit very hard by military downsizing, most of us believe that we are all better off. We should follow the same procedure with corporate welfare. Prior to traveling here, I polled a few CEO friends of mine in Silicon Valley to see if they would support a statement saying that they would support cuts to corporate welfare, even if it meant cuts in government funding to their companies. Most agreed, and their statement is attached as an appendix to this testimony. As a general rule, Silicon Valley CEOs like smaller governments and lower taxes, and are willing to forego subsidies to achieve those goals. CEOs would much rather make money with healthy companies in a healthy economy than receive welfare from the government. I believe that the popular impression that CEOs cling strongly to their corporate welfare is completely inaccurate and stems from two sources: 1) a few CEOs who receive massive subsidies and do fight for them, and 2) industry lobbyists who are out of touch with their constituencies. I have testified before the Senate and House against corporate welfare since 1989. In my 1995 testimony before a House Subcommittee, my opponent was a lobbyist from the American Electronics Association (AEA). His testimony started with, ``We represent 10,000 corporations * * *'' What struck me was that my company was a member of AEA, and that we were paying this man to argue against me! The AEA was out of touch with the Silicon Valley CEOs I know, and absolutely misrepresented my position. Furthermore, the AEA had never polled me to determine whether or not our company wanted them to lobby for maintaining Commerce Department subsidies. The AEA started as a Silicon Valley-based electronics organization. Now, like many other lobbying organizations, it has moved to Washington and been co-opted by the pork-barrel process. One unspoken assumption behind the AEA seems to be, ``Our job is to bring home the pork for electronics companies.'' Although many of us agree with tactical positions taken by the AEA on workplace or technical issues, I know that there is no consensus support for pork- barrel politics among high-tech CEOs. When I returned to California after that meeting, I asked why we had joined the AEA. The answer was that our membership was solicited by mail, the dues were low, and we simply signed up in order to get information. I fired the AEA; we are no longer members. We are members of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). I testified earlier that I do not believe the American taxpayer should be compelled to subsidize the sale of American products overseas. The most recent cover story of the NAM Briefing newsletter is entitled, ``NAM Report Proves Export Financing is Critical to Job Creation.'' NAM favors taxing people to subsidize exports. They argue that the Japanese, French, and Spanish do it, and we must also in order to be competitive. In other words, they are using every tired argument debunked in this testimony to justify their favored form of corporate welfare. I am going to fire NAM as soon as I get home. Conclusion Our government did best for its people when it stayed near its founding principles of free markets, limited government, and enlightened self interest. It did better economically and it did better morally. Unfortunately, starting with the 16th Amendment, and then the New Deal in the 1930's, we have drifted toward socialism. The government now controls 35 percent of America's output. That makes us all poorer and less free. The reasons for government taking one-third of what Americans produce are couched in Washington-speak and technobabble and do not stand up to scrutiny. The words rationalize the workings of a system in which taxing and spending drive us in a downward economic spiral. We are at a cross-roads where we can choose to seize the opportunity to leave epithets like ``pork barrel'' and ``corporate welfare'' behind us and return to the high ground. American business has always been ready to lead. By 1800, America had more corporations than all of Europe, combined. We can help revitalize the American Dream. Stop taking money from Americans for socialist subsidies--companies do not need or want that kind of money. Capitalists make money from customers who voluntarily trade their money for the higher value we provide them. We declare independence from the corporate welfare state. The difference between it and free market capitalism is the difference between taking and giving, immorality and morality, poverty and wealth. Make the right choice, end corporate welfare. Declaration of Independence: End Corporate Welfare The high taxes that our company and its employees pay to support the current local-state-federal government tax burden of 35 percent of GDP hurts our economy more than any possible corporate benefit from government spending. If an independent commission similar to the military base-closing commission identified a fair and substantial government spending cut in the area of so-called ``corporate welfare,'' I would support that cut, even if it meant funding cuts to my own company.

Welling, CEO, Xiox Corporation Phillips Smith, CEO, Zycad Corporation The Political Greening of Silicon Valley Silicon Valley went political for the first time to stop Proposition 211, the California ballot initiative that would have subjected Silicon Valley companies to a blizzard of shareholder lawsuits. Of course, real shareholders almost never bring so-called shareholder lawsuits, these suits are brought by securities-litigation specialists such as Bill Lerach, the market-share leader in suing high tech companies. Lerach was the author of Proposition 211. During my 28 years in Silicon Valley, I saw Intel's chairman emeritus, Gordon Moore, only about once per year. Our conversations were almost exclusively about the chip business. During one extraordinary 3-month period in 1995, however, I met four times not only with Gordon Moore, but also with a large group of Silicon Valley CEOs, to talk politics: how to defeat Proposition 211. That Silicon Valley leaders would convene for and contribute $30 million to a political activity was unprecedented. We did it because Proposition 211 threatened the core of how we do business. For example, one of the provisions of Proposition 211 made it illegal for companies to indemnify their board of directors against lawsuits. How could any Silicon Valley company assemble a board of directors if the directors' personal property were liable to the vagaries of class action lawsuits? We defeated Proposition 211 by a 3-1 margin, but our activism on Proposition 211 triggered the still-ongoing series of media reports on the ``political greening of Silicon Valley.'' The press badly wants us in the action: Silicon Valley should stop sitting on the sidelines, stop being isolationist technonerds, recognize the value of government- industry partnerships, become part of the process and help lead the country. I believe we could make no bigger mistake. Silicon Valley is what it is because of the core values that drive our success. The politics- as-usual we ignore is antithetical to--and highly destructive of--those core values. I will build the framework for that conclusion--starting with the basic American freedoms that allow for the very existence of Silicon Valley--as follows: Freedom and free markets (that is, capitalism) are built into the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. America is unique in that it was the first truly free nation. Freedom creates prosperity. Silicon Valley is an island of freedom and free markets, more in line with 1776 America and its government than 1998 America and its government. Many CEOs practice not free-market capitalism but collectivism in one of its forms. Collectivism is the irrevocable enemy of capitalism. The collectivism espoused by big government undermines capitalism and therefore the fundamental wealth-producing process of Silicon Valley. Rapport with Washington offers only downside to Silicon Valley. For these reasons, Technet, the Silicon Valley lobbying organization, is a bad idea. Freedom in America The basic premise of freedom is: I own myself. Therefore, I do what I want and go where I want--subject, of course, to the responsibilities to observe the freedom of others. Our freedoms beyond self-ownership are enumerated in the Bill of Rights, constitutional amendments 1-10. (Here, I would like to stop to thank the Cato Foundation for the booklet given to each of you, a pocket-sized reprint of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.) The first amendment calls for freedom of religion, speech, press, and assembly. The form of these rights is particularly important: ``Congress shall make no law prohibiting the freedom of * * *.'' I call this form a ``protective right,'' because it tells us what the government cannot do to us, not what the government promises to do for us, like the so-called right to a ``decent'' wage, what I refer to as an ``entitlement right,'' one which is not part of our basic freedoms-- and shouldn't be, as I'll explain later. The first 10 amendments take the form of protective rights: to protect us from government because our founders did not trust unfettered democracy. John Adams, our first vice president and second president, said: ``We may appeal to every page of history we have hitherto turned over, for proofs irrefragable, that the people, when they have been unchecked, have been as unjust, tyrannical, brutal, barbarous, and cruel, as any king or senate possessed of uncontrollable power. The majority has eternally, and without one exception, usurped over the rights of the minority.'' John Adams would say, ``I told you so,'' if he knew that the TV- sitcom son of Archie Bunker, ``meathead'' Rob Reiner, had just succeeded in passing California Proposition 10, an initiative to tax smokers 50 cents a pack because Reiner doesn't like cigarette companies and smoking. The tax is earmarked to ``help children,'' via a new, ill- defined, statewide bureaucracy. Even if we dislike smoking and believe in helping children, we should never support any government action that confiscates the property of a minority group at the whim of, in the case of Proposition 10, a 50.1 percent majority. High-tech leaders Microsoft and Intel are currently learning that yesterday's Gallup-Poll heroes can become today's pariahs, just as subject to unfair government action as the tobacco companies. The Constitution also allows individuals to own their own thoughts--that is, their intellectual property--in the form of our patent system. And the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution also defines the right to own real property without the fear of unwarranted search or confiscation: ``The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.'' With the right to own real and intellectual property comes the right to freely trade property with others. That's the basic mechanism of capitalism: free trade between consenting parties. I think most Americans embrace these basic freedoms. Our government talks that talk, but as we know, they certainly do not walk that walk. Consider the so-called ``living wage'' measure just adopted by the city of San Jose. One advocate of the new $10.75-per-hour mandated wage said that ``we should find it in our hearts'' to pass the measure. Although he did find compassion in his heart, unfortunately, he had to reach into someone else's pocket to pay for his compassion. That's what is wrong with the San Jose and all other minimum wage laws: They strip away the basic right of consenting parties to freely trade their goods and services in an uncoerced marketplace. Minimum-wage laws are not about compassion, they are about politics--politicians currying favor with one block of voters by turning the government into a collective bargaining agency with powers well beyond those of any union. Often, capitalists defend free markets with the wrong reasons--on economic rather than moral terms. The president of the San Jose Chamber of Commerce argued against the new ``living wage'' law because it will cause economic harm. That may be true, but most in harm's way will be the poor, many of whom will face the prospect of being fired from their jobs under the new law because they cannot provide the value to warrant their new non-market salary. But economic harm is not why minimum-wage laws are wrong. Minimum wage laws are wrong because they immorally strip away our basic freedom to trade our services and property freely. It is also true that lost freedom causes economic harm, as I will demonstrate later. Minimum-wage laws are one example of entitlement rights. Other examples include a government guarantee to a given wage, health care, or a job. Although we all want a world with good wages, universal health care, and low unemployment, we must realize that these goals are not ``rights'' at all in the sense of our Constitutional rights; they are nothing more than a government demand that Americans surrender their property and wages to achieve government-mandated objectives. If we believe in the basic protective rights outlined in the Constitution, we cannot consistently believe in any entitlement ``right'' that negates those basic rights. America, the First Free Nation America was founded on principles unique and profoundly different from those of its predecessors. Our Constitution defined a government that was for the first time architected from the bottom-up (the people owned a government that was created to serve them) rather than from the top-down (the king-dictator, tribe leader, politburo--owns you and your property). One might be tempted to say that the European monarchies were on the path of providing rights like ours, but, even under the assumption of similar rights, there was a profound philosophical difference. For example, British rights were granted in documents like the Magna Carta, which granted some rights from an otherwise top-down government. The American mind-set was, ``I am the king, I own you and your property--even your wife on the first night--but, being a good king, I will grant you the following rights.'' In our bottom-up government, the first 10 amendments are protective rights, covering most daily activities--speaking, praying, owning things, defending yourself--over which government control was explicitly forbidden. The mind-set was totally different, ``We are the people; we own the government--and it will not be allowed to interfere with us in the following ways.'' Furthermore, the Bill of Rights finishes with the 10th Amendment, which imposes a limit on government: ``The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution * * * are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.'' In other words, the government was specifically forbidden from meddling in an area where no powers were expressly granted. I wonder what the authors of the Bill of Rights would say about the Federal Government's current micromanagement of our daily lives, like the case of the meat-packing plant in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was penalized in 1 week by the Food and Drug Administration for unsanitary plant conditions, and by OSHA the next for unsafe working conditions caused by frequently washed wet floors? In addition to the personal and economic freedoms outlined in the Bill of Rights, our Constitution did not allow a Federal tax to be imposed on individuals; no revenue stream was to be created to feed a potential monster. Americans paid no Federal taxes until 1913, when we mistakenly passed the 16th Amendment to allow the Federal income tax. The passing of that amendment set the tone of duplicity common in tax legislation today. The 16th Amendment was passed with a promise that there would be a top-bracket tax of only 7 percent levied only on the richest 1 percent of Americans. The promise lasted 3 years. By 1918, the average American was taxed, and the top-bracket rate reached 77 percent. Since no one would ever really pay a 77 percent income tax, we instituted some very destructive systems: complex tax laws to aid in tax dodging, Congressional micromanagement of the economy using tax breaks, and the practice of giving political contributions in return for tax breaks and subsidies. The corporation was an important part of our economic freedom, even in colonial times. Corporations provide the ability for people to work together with joint liability, rather than individual liability. That means if the company we work for becomes liable to another company or individual, our personal property cannot be confiscated, only that of our company. One reason Proposition 211 was so abhorrent to Silicon Valley is that it made it illegal for the directors of a company to have the same individual liability protection enjoyed by all other company employees. Without corporations, individuals would not organize to perform tasks greater than individuals can achieve alone. America did not invent corporations, but we embraced them. By 1800, there were more corporations in America than in all of the great countries of Europe combined. Freedom Creates Prosperity Ayn Rand once asked the rhetorical question, ``Where did the extra come from?'' She was referring to the wealth created by capitalism. She noted that after capitalism's invention, wealth creation reached the rate of 300 percent per century, while prior to capitalism, the world had achieved a rate of only 3 percent per century. I decided to quantify more carefully Rand's back-of-the-envelope look at economic prosperity. My most accurate estimate for wealth creation since 1776 is 458 percent per century. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7748.152 Figure 1. This graph of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita vs. year shows that Americans in 1776 produced $919 per person per year in 1996 dollars, according to a 1994 Stanford economic study done by Passell and Atack. By 1869, the Department of Commerce reported its first results at $3,124 per person per year. Since 1869, yearly data shows an increase to $28,540 in 1996. The growth rate of GDP per capita from 1776 to 1996--which is nearly identical to the growth rate of the average wage--is thus best estimated at 458 percent per century. Rand was right--something big did happen around 1776--and the common man became much more prosperous, much faster, than ever before in history. A more contemporary look at the relationship between freedom and prosperity is produced on a yearly basis by Canada's Fraser Institute, whose Economic Freedom Index ranks countries according to complex measures including: The size of government as a percent of the economy. Government investment relative to the private sector. The use of price controls. The top marginal tax rate. The right of citizens to own foreign currency. The right of citizens to hold foreign bank accounts. The protection of property rights. The freedom to trade with foreigners. Taxes on international trade. Private vs. public bank ownership. The use of interest rate controls. The use of conscripts to obtain military personnel. It is interesting to note that the military draft is considered in an economic context, separate from its impact on human rights. However, if you think back to the basic rights of owning yourself and of trading your services to others at a mutually agreed-upon price, there is a big difference between forcing people to join the military under the threat of jail and obtaining a voluntary agreement with people to serve in the military for compensation. I doubt that the Vietnam War would have happened if Americans had to pay for it at free-market prices. The factors in the Fraser index are weighted and condensed into a single scale that ranges from zero to 10, the best score. All of the world's prosperous, large economies--the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Japan, Germany, and France--have freedom indices in the top 20 percent of the index. Conversely, Fraser's bottom-20 percent is populated exclusively by economic train wrecks. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7748.153 Figure 2. A list of the world's countries, ranked by economic freedom on a scale of 1-10. The United States ranks No. 3 in economic freedom. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7748.154 Figure 3. The correlation between national GDP per capita and freedom shows that freer countries are richer countries. Comparing the five quintiles of the Fraser Economic Freedom Index shows that countries in the top 20 percent of the index have a per capita income which is more than 10 times that of countries in the bottom 20 percent. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7748.155 Figure 4. The growth rate of real GDP per capita increases as economic freedom increases. In addition to earning a higher yearly income, people in freer countries also see their income growing at a rate faster than that of people in countries with less freedom. In the least-free countries, per capita income is actually shrinking. The old adage that the ``rich get richer, and the poor get poorer'' is a fact. The rich get richer not because of some unfair advantage, but because they demand freedom. Again, we should remember our priorities: we're free because that is morally right--and we're prosperous because we're free. Silicon Valley, Basic American Values at Work The free market in Silicon Valley is not well ordered or even predictable. People are free to quit, to start up their own company, and they often do. More often than not, start-ups end in failure: three out of four don't make it. That tolerance for failure is a very important factor that differentiates the Silicon Valley economy. When a start-up company fails in Silicon Valley, no one wails about the unfairness of foreign competition or the need for government intervention. We simply say something like, ``Did you hear that Schlock Tech cratered?'' And then we get on with making sure we don't suffer the same fate. Failure is OK in Silicon Valley, because we truly believe that people are the key asset of any company, and that the newly defeated will be quickly re-employed to try again. When one of our competitors had a large layoff a few months ago, our HR department hired an airplane to fly over its headquarters, hauling a banner with our name and web site address. While the ``right to fail'' is a key attribute in a truly capitalistic economy, it is alien to the security- seeking ``old economy.'' When Chrysler got in trouble, it successfully pleaded for a government bailout ``to save jobs.'' When Intel got in such deep trouble in 1985-1986 that it laid off one-third of its work force, it never asked for a bailout, and there was no surge in unemployment. The rest of Silicon Valley simply hired the windfall of exceptional talent. When a Silicon Valley company can no longer afford to support its employees and shareholders, it is natural and right that the process Schumpeter described as ``creative destruction'' be allowed to move employees from low productivity jobs in a troubled company to higher productivity jobs elsewhere. It is not only wrong to coerce people into supporting a failing company, it's also economically disastrous for our government to save old, low-productivity jobs just because that company has developed a skillful lobbying department. The basic right of individuals to own their ideas takes on particular importance in Silicon Valley. Most ventures are funded specifically because of their intellectual property. Cypress's original intellectual property consisted of a way to make transistors faster than those of our competitors and a business plan to bring that technical capability to the market. Our 15-page business plan--and the six founders to pull it off--sold to a consortium of six venture firms for $3.5 million. Today Cypress's market capitalization has grown to approximately $1 billion--that's a typical, even modest, story of wealth creation in Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley is an economic meritocracy where people know that salary is not the path to prosperity. They know that ``owning a piece of the rock''--and then making the rock worth a lot of money--is the only way to prosper. Here, the greatest wealth goes to those who create the greatest value. Intel became rich because it sells 80 million computer chips a year for about $200 each, a great value because each of those computer chips has about 50,000 times the power of a 1950's- vintage mainframe computer that cost $5 million. Silicon Valley knows that the old adage ``money makes money'' is false. We know that people make money, and money makes money only when it's invested in the right people. That's why Silicon Valley considers people to be an asset, not a liability, the way government views them. That's why when we see an immigrant we do not see a potential welfare case but an intellect with the potential to help one of our companies. The chairman of our board of directors and four of Cypress's ten executive vice presidents are immigrants. Silicon Valley is a successful and dynamic example of the basic American values outlined earlier at work: private property, intellectual property ownership, and free markets. Just as Americans are better off than people in other countries because our economy is freer, so the people of Silicon Valley are better off than the average American, because the Silicon Valley economy is even more free. I view Silicon Valley as a place of ``free minds and free markets,'' to use the trademark phrase of the Reason Foundation. Capitalism is not just an economic system here, it is a way of life. And, to me, it is a natural way of life. I always remember a bumper sticker that read, ``Capitalism: What people do when they're left alone.'' Capitalism has made the whole Valley rich, not just its CEOs. The 4.2 million factory workers employed by the high-tech industry earn almost twice the yearly wage of workers in other industries. And--as I will illustrate in a poignant example--our markets have enabled us to become strategically important to America, as we have invented or commercialized revolutionary innovations such as the silicon chip, the computer, genetic engineering, and the Internet. I don't want more government in Silicon Valley. Government can do only two things here: take our money, limiting our economic resources, or pass laws, limiting our other freedoms. The question then arises: Why does Silicon Valley appear to be ``going political''? Why do we see some of our CEOs actively embrace Washington? The counterintuitive answer is that many businessmen are not capitalists, as I have defined that term. Indeed, in many corporations, there are better capitalists in the stockroom than in the boardroom. Many CEOs Are Not Capitalists I used to naively assume that a CEO, by the nature of his or her job, was a free-market capitalist. That view became problematical when I noted that some CEOs did very non-capitalistic things, like lobbying for corporate welfare. I wondered, was there some sort of ``new capitalism,'' embodying concepts like ``government-industry partnerships,'' that transcended my traditionalist version? The Cato essay, ``The Paradox of the Statist Businessman,'' by Theodore J. Forstmann, addresses this apparent contradiction. Forstmann points out that just as the basic values of most ministers are undermined by the TV evangelist, Jimmy Swaggart, so are the values of capitalist CEOs undermined by what Forstmann calls the statist CEO, those CEOs who compete using the power of the state. The prototype capitalist CEO lives right here in Silicon Valley: He or she is an entrepreneur with a position earned on merit, often the head of a start-up company that has created wealth not only for the CEO but also broadly for employees and shareholders. Let's contrast a hypothetical Silicon Valley capitalist businesswoman with a hypothetical statist businessman. To visualize the statist businessman, think about the behemoth company you dislike most--a company that is arrogant, treats its customers poorly, has lost market share, is always ``downsizing,'' and fights a protracted battle with hostile, unionized employees. Its CEO is almost undoubtedly a statist businessman. While the entrepreneur earned or created her position, the statist businessman achieved his position by climbing the corporate ladder, much the same way a politician climbs the political ladder--by currying favor with the right people; by not stepping on the wrong toes; and by building a power base. And like the politician who has clawed his way to the top, holding power is the statist businessman's top priority, even above the interests of his company. Meanwhile, the entrepreneurial businesswoman has no time for corporate power struggles, she has to concentrate on the tumultuous world of Silicon Valley, where a new start-up or well-staffed big company might take a devastating toll on the competition in only a few quarters. The statist businessman draws a huge salary and bonus, as negotiated by his agents. His perks--corporate jets, limos, lavish expense-account dinners--are the reward for climbing the ladder. Those of you who have traveled here for this meeting will find out that there are no great, super-expensive restaurants in Silicon Valley and that night life here is characterized by freeways jammed at 7 p.m., when we leave work. The corporate jet is a Silicon Valley joke. Gil Amelio's short tenures as CEO of National Semiconductor and then Apple Computer were punctuated by derisive reports on how he insisted that each company pay for his private airplane. Once, as I flew in a middle seat in coach class into Beaufort, South Carolina, to speak to a Fortune 500 conference, I counted 52 corporate jets that flew in the CEO for golf-- and a little conferencing. The entrepreneurial CEO keeps her salary and bonus very modest by Fortune 500 standards. That is not to say Silicon Valley entrepreneurs cannot get very rich: Intel's founders have earned hundreds of millions of dollars in capital gains. It is easy to make a hundred million dollars in Silicon Valley--all you have to do is own 1 percent of your company and then spend 20 years making that company worth $100 billion. Intel's current $160-billion market capitalization was created from nothing. Intel's employees and shareholders benefited with over $99 of capital gain for every $1 collected by its founders. The statist businessman wins using the state; that is, government. His large and effective lobbying organization is skilled at reducing taxes on his company, increasing the taxes on competing import products, creating quotas to block the imports he cannot tax away, and lobbying for pork--those ``government-industry partnerships'' that allow him to continue on in businesses that would not otherwise be economically justified. Archer Daniels Midland Corporation's chairman, Dwayne Andreas, is one of the most effective statist CEOs, dubbed the ``prince of political influence'' by The Wall Street Journal. About half of ADM's agricultural products are subsidized or protected by the Federal Government. The company rakes in $400 million per year from the government, gives lavishly to both major parties, and advertises heavily on Sunday morning TV political talk shows. ADM gets my vote for the most unreasonable subsidy: a tax break on each gallon of corn- ethanol production that exceeds the production cost of the gallon of gasoline it replaces. While the statist CEO has a well-staffed Washington office and government action agenda, most Silicon Valley companies do not have any presence in Washington at all. Even large Silicon Valley companies, such as Intel, have only a modest presence in Washington. And even then, Intel's six full-time lobbyists do only defensive work--to protect the company from inappropriate, top-down government mandates-- rather than lobbying for corporate welfare. The differences between the capitalist entrepreneur and the statist businessman could not be greater: It is the difference between free market capitalism and the collectivism inherent when government distorts free market action. The statist businessman is no friend of Silicon Valley. He could not be more different from Silicon Valley leaders, despite the fact that his title may be ``CEO.'' Collectivism, Enemy of Capitalism There are many forms of collectivism, some are mislabeled as ``capitalism.'' The former Soviet Union is a straightforward example: collectivism took the form of socialism, an unmitigated economic disaster. However, consider the Japanese keiretsus and Korean chaebols. They're labeled ``crony capitalism'' by the press but are really nothing more than mutations of collectivism. The freedom of Americans to invest their money in a diverse, international money market contributes to our high score on the Fraser Economic Freedom Index. The Japanese money market is not free. Japanese people cannot choose among 500 different mutual funds. Free-market competition for Japanese investment by American financial institutions is banned by the cronies that run crony capitalism. With limited investment choices, the Japanese put their money into post office accounts, which currently pay 0.25 percent interest--yes, you heard me correctly. Of course, any American financial institution would be overjoyed to give the Japanese people 2.5 percent interest, 10 times the going rate, but that's not allowed. Having used the government to block free-market choice for savings, the keiretsus then exploit their ``government-industry partnerships'' to use the cheap money as they want, usually as below-market loans to subsidize manufacturing companies. Although the men who run the keiretsus are much more competent than those who ran the Soviet Politburo, no elite power structure can make decisions as well as the free marketplace. The keiretsus looked unstoppable in the '80's, when they effectively attacked our semiconductor industry. But the strategy of the Japanese keiretsus and Korean chaebols--to use nearly free money to gain market share without regard to profitability--has no more economic integrity than a Ponzi scheme, it just takes longer to collapse. Meanwhile in Silicon Valley, American investors, represented by their tough and aggressive mutual fund managers, demanded fair returns on their money, forcing our companies into a pay-as-you-go mode. With 6 percent money, our industry had a tough time competing against Japanese competitors with 0.25 percent money, but the free market capitalism of Silicon Valley prevailed over the collectivism of Japan. After a brief period of market-share leadership, the Japanese semiconductor industry has collapsed far into second place with a 32.5 percent market share, compared with America's 49.2 percent, according to semiconductor research organization Dataquest. Clyde Prestowicz declared the demise of the American semiconductor industry in his naive book, ``Trading Places,'' a work that became the mantra for every collectivist in Washington who wanted more control of Silicon Valley. The Japanese semiconductor scare produced Silicon Valley's only noncapitalist aberration, the successful lobbying effort to gain $1 billion in corporate welfare to support Sematech, a semiconductor industry consortium. Fortunately, our leaders woke up quickly and dumped the subsidy with hundreds of millions of dollars still available. The current charter of our Semiconductor Industry Association now calls for ``free and open markets,'' and the SIA board of directors is on record saying that it will not lobby for government subsidies. What Washington lobbying group do you know that stands for free and open markets with no subsidies? In 1997, I testified before Congress to support the elimination of the Department of Commerce, a primary delivery vehicle for corporate pork. By circulating a statement denouncing corporate welfare only 48 hours before my departure, I was able to get signatures of 79 Silicon Valley CEOs, who agreed to swear off corporate pork, even if it meant that their companies lost government funding. Do you think I could convince Archer Daniels Midland's chairman to sign that document? I even tested one of my icons, Jack Welsh, the CEO of General Electric, a big recipient of corporate welfare. Jack said ``no'' via a letter written in bafflegab by one of his ``government relations'' people. Americans may live in the most economically free major world economy, but capitalism vs. collectivism is not a black-white dichotomy; it has a gray scale. Currently, our state, local, and Federal Governments control about 40 percent of our gross domestic product--that is 40 percent of the combined output of every American. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7748.156 Figure 5. Prior to the enactment of the Federal income tax in 1916, only 10 percent of America's then-small GDP was required to run the government. During periods of war, the amount spiked up, but later returned close to prior levels. There are two noticeable periods of American economic socialization: in the 1930's, when President Roosevelt took a second 10 percent of America's output for the Great Depression, and in the post-World War II period, when America and other democracies began a process of economic socialization. President Reagan mitigated that trend in the 80's, but he did not reverse it. Although you may think that 40 percent of GDP is an excessive cost for government, most of the socialized democracies of Europe spend more than 40 percent--and have the stagnant economies to show for it. One easy way to pinpoint the absurdity of the American tax bite is to question the 39.6 percent tax rates levied on Silicon Valley CEO's and the 36 percent rate levied on their companies. The standard argument for higher taxes is that they fund a greater good, like curing cancer. Of course, it is not at all clear that cancer could not be cured more quickly and cheaply with private funds, or that the ``greater good'' espoused is always as noble as fighting cancer. My favorite line item in this year's omnibus budget--pork-barrel legislation of cosmic proportion--is a $500,000 line item for horse- manure management. I am not joking with you, it is really in there. And while you are laughing, I'll add that there is another $500,000 line item for pig-manure management. Two Congressmen, two states, two campaign promises kept--it is the American government way. Let me attack the tax-for-greater-good argument as it applies to us in Silicon Valley. Consider the effect when the Clinton-Gore administration raised the tax on Silicon Valley companies from 35 percent to 36 percent. Vice-President Gore basks in the technology image that a few Silicon Valley leaders have given him. But that extra 1 percent tax Al Gore levied on Silicon Valley takes away billions of dollars from Silicon Valley--over $400 million a year from Intel alone. Consider that corporate tax on Intel a choice: either Intel invests its own profits, or surrenders those profits as taxes to be invested by the government. Intel's $400 million will be invested; raising or lowering taxes just decides who invests it. From that perspective, we have the preposterous claim that high-tech VP Al Gore can do better by investing the $400 million than could Intel's CEO, Craig Barrett. I state the obvious: Every American would be better off if Craig Barrett invested the $400 million. An equally absurd situation arises when the government taxes Silicon Valley CEOs at a rate of 39.6 percent. By raising the tax on top-bracket individuals from 36 percent to 39.6 percent, the Clinton- Gore administration will have extracted in the neighborhood of $1 million in extra taxes from the average Silicon Valley CEO by the time their administration ends in 2000. In my case, I have paid those extra taxes by selling off some of my investments, most of which are made in electronics, biotech, and Internet-related companies right here in the Valley. Many of those companies are funded by venture capitalists with whom I work. I often evaluate compa- nies, people, and business plans for venture capitalists. Sometimes I even join the boards of start-up companies to help them succeed. Who would best invest the last $1 million that I earned and gave to the government, me or high-tech VP Al Gore? Silicon Valley is an island of capitalism in a sea of collectivism. We are surrounded by big governments, big unions, big media, and big, statist corporations. We are an island of meritocracy in a sea of power struggles. In Silicon Valley, the phrase ``what you know is more important than who you know'' is a fact of life, not just an unrealized ideal. Do Not Normalize Silicon Valley's Relationship With Washington By the very way it works, Washington undermines the free minds and free markets that are the cornerstone of Silicon Valley's success. Republicans claim their party stands for free markets, but they are the enemy of individual freedom, desiring to control by Federal law what you watch and what your reproductive habits are. The Democrats claim that their party stands for individual freedom, but they have always been the party of the free lunch, the party willing to tax and spend because they arrogantly believe they have a better idea of what to do with your money than you do. The metric that differentiates Silicon Valley from Washington does not fall along conventional political lines: Republican vs. Democrat, conservative vs. liberal, right vs. left. The key issue separating Silicon Valley from Washington is freedom vs. control. That is the metric that contrasts individual freedom to speak vs. tap-ready telephones, local reinvestment of profit vs. taxes to Washington, encryption to protect privacy vs. government eavesdropping, success in the marketplace vs. government subsidies, and a free Internet vs. a regulated Internet. Once you understand that the left-right or liberal-conservative dimension is not the dimension that measures the gap between Silicon Valley and Washington, you will begin to see that the Washington politicians who argue vehemently about their supposedly profound differences are really cut from the same cloth. Think about the ultimate left- and right-wing figures in history. Perhaps the ultimate left-winger is Joseph Stalin and the ultimate right-winger is Adolph Hitler. Were these men really that different? Or does the left-right spectrum actually turn in on itself, putting Hitler and Stalin next to each other? I believe Hitler and Stalin were nearly the same, with the only thing separating them being the list of things for which they would kill you. In these less totalitarian times, we might view famous current left- and right-wingers, Teddy Kennedy and Newt Gingrich, as being nearly the same, separated only by the list of things for which they would put you in jail or take your money. The political parties are not even delivering their half-promises of freedom. The Republicans are not delivering on economic freedom, and the Democrats are not delivering on individual freedom. Newt Gingrich, the self-proclaimed champion of small government, just managed the passage of a bill to purchase hundreds of millions of dollars worth of C130 cargo aircraft that the Pentagon stated publicly it did not want. The Pentagon has complained that it receives unneeded C130's every year, which it quickly passes along to National Reserve units. Quite by coincidence, those C130's are made in Georgia, Gingrich's home state. And Kennedy, the champion of personal freedom who protects individuals from big corporations, just authored a healthcare bill, which for no discernible reason whatsoever allows the American government to confiscate your assets--yes that is right, to violate the Constitution and take away your property--if you obtain foreign citizenship. Who goes to Washington? Those who have chosen governing--that is, ruling--for a profession. Washington is in the business of restricting freedom, and, therefore, in the business of undermining the foundation of Silicon Valley. On the economic side, what has Washington got to offer Silicon Valley? Consider the pork-barrel process by which Washington works: it extracts 20 percent of the yearly output of Americans as Federal taxes, consumes much of it to run a grotesquely inefficient organization, and then allows us to fight to get back the rest of what we first earned in the form of grants and subsidies. Silicon Valley is not very good at the pork-barrel game. Statist companies have refined their lobbying skills for decades. We cannot and do not want to win at their game. Famous bank robber Willie Sutton, when asked why he robbed banks, said, ``Because that's where the money is.'' Today, Silicon Valley is where the money is. Anyone who believes that money will flow uphill from Washington to Silicon Valley is very naive. Simon Cameron, three-time U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania from 1847- 1877, said, ``An honest politician is one who, when he is bought, stays bought.'' By that standard, President Clinton is not a good politician. One of the few political issues of interest to Silicon Valley is shareholder litigation reform, an effort to protect our businesses from continuous barrages by the shareholder lawsuit industry. Over half the member companies of the American Electronics Association have been sued for shareholder fraud by a small group of law firms specializing in this lucrative endeavor. We must believe that either half of AEA member companies are crooked, or that we have a group of lawyers running amuck. In 1995, Silicon Valley lobbied for the Securities Litigation Reform Act, the SLRA, an act that put a higher burden of proof on plaintiffs in shareholder lawsuits before they are allowed to initiate the extraordinarily expensive discovery phase of a trial. My company was sued in 1992 when our share price dropped after we reported $0.15 earnings per share for the quarter compared with analysts' expectations of $0.20. The ``fraud'' claim was ``justified'' by using several of my quotes (for example, in 1991, after seven consecutive years of growth, I said we expected to grow again in 1992) and by declaring that earnings below expectations must therefore constitute fraud. This ridiculous complaint, created in hours by a legal lawsuit factory, launched us into a 5-year, $5-million proceeding, before a Federal judge found the case had no merit and threw it out of court. The 1995 SLRA was carefully crafted by the Senate to balance the opposing objectives of limiting frivolous lawsuits while preserving the right to sue for those truly defrauded. Even though Clinton wooed Silicon Valley by telling us he supported litigation reform, he had also taken political contributions from plaintiff lawyers. He chose them over us and vetoed our litigation reform bill. Fortunately for us, the SLRA was so well-crafted that a Democratic Congress overrode Clinton's veto. Shortly after that fiasco, Clinton returned to Silicon Valley for some more PR and to raise money at a prominent CEO's house at a $50,000 per plate dinner. One dinner topic was litigation reform. Clinton then accepted several hundred thousand dollars to perform a back-flip. He turned on the securities lawyers and denounced Proposition 211, which would have effectively overridden the newly enacted SLRA in California. Politicians know that playing both sides of an issue often brings in money from each side. Clinton repeated the performance this year when he flew to Silicon Valley for one fund raiser, and then flew on to San Diego the next day for a fund raiser hosted by Silicon Valley's legal nemesis, Bill Lerach. Siding with the Clinton administration may give Silicon Valley a temporary advantage on some issues, but in the long haul, this administration undermines our basic values. The Democrats have no monopoly on undermining our values. Republican Bob Dole was the patron saint of Archer Daniels Midland's billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies. Dole flew on ADM's plane numerous times at submarket rates and purchased a Florida condo from ADM, also at a sub-market price. Pork-barrel politics is not only wrong, it is also highly inefficient. Often, the grants that come back to Silicon Valley are politicized into a state of worthlessness. For example, 4 years ago, Electronic News published a report about making gallium arsenide--a semiconductor several times faster than silicon--aboard the space shuttle. Despite my own graduate-level training in transistor physics, and the fact that I was a member of the board of directors of Vitesse Semiconductor, the largest commercial manufacturer of gallium arsenide chips, I could see no economic benefit whatsoever in the space chips. Neither did Dr. Lou Tomasetta, Vitesse's CEO, who called the space chips ``a solution looking for a problem.'' In this case, an ``industry-government partnership'' launched several $150-million shuttle flights without consulting with the industry partners, who would have predicted correctly that the ``chips in space'' program was useless. This is a classic and apparently contagious example of collectivist science: When I visited Zelenograd, Russia's version of Silicon Valley, near Moscow, I found that the Politburo had funded the same project. Stacked neatly in the corner of a museum were space-grown crystals not only of gallium arsenide, but also indium antimonide and lithium niobate. On the personal side of freedom, Washington is in the control business, but faces an obstacle described by Ayn Rand, in ``Atlas Shrugged,'' ``There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power government has is to crack down on criminals. When there aren't enough criminals, one makes them: one declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws.'' Many of you who traveled here may not know that you broke a Federal law. This year, under a new law, it is illegal to carry prescription drugs not sealed in their original container. So, if you use a pillbox to carry a prescription drug along with your aspirin and vitamins, you broke a Federal law. In addition to the asset confiscation penalty on foreign citizenship I described earlier, Sen. Kennedy authored a law with 100 pages of ``healthcare crimes,'' which also passed this year. These laws also turned the Federal Governments new weapon of choice--asset confiscation--on doctors that commit such crimes. Kennedy is ready to guarantee our so-called right to healthcare--by violating Americans' Fourth Amendment right to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.'' Why should Silicon Valley engage with a culture that attacks freedom on so many fronts? As ``healthcare crime'' laws are to medicine, so are the extraordinarily ambiguous and illogical antitrust laws to business. Rand ridiculed the contradiction of ``free markets, enforced by law.'' The antitrust laws, a modern invention of the so-called trustbusting era--in effect make it illegal for a company to be conspicuously successful. The ambiguity of the laws grants the government huge powers to define on an ad hoc basis what is legal and illegal, thus giving it control over the company's operations. Often the government uses another oxymoronic device, the ``consent decree,'' to enforce its will on businesses seeking to avoid protracted litigation against a foe with unlimited resources. Illogic comes from illogical laws. Consider the 1945 antitrust case of the United States vs. Alcoa Aluminum. Federal Judge Learned Hand was Alcoa's judge and jury in that case, as is typical in antitrust cases. He broke Alcoa apart with a judgement that contained this rationalization: It was not inevitable that [Alcoa] should always anticipate increases in the demand for ingot and be prepared to supply them * * * before others entered the field. It insists that it never excluded competitors; but we can think of no more effective exclusion than progressively to embrace each new opportunity as it opened. That's right, Alcoa was convicted and broken apart for committing the crime of building an efficient company that gained market share! Some high technology companies are now conspicuously successful. And, true to form, Washington's attack on Intel and Microsoft already has begun. The dreadful vagaries of the antitrust laws are most evident in the ongoing Microsoft trial. A single judge listens to the complaints of a few resentful competitors, reads a colorful memo from a Microsoft executive talking about ``choking the air'' out of some competitor, and then has the power to break apart the company founded and built by others over a decade, perhaps destroying billions of dollars of market capitalization in the process. A verdict against Microsoft would read as poorly in time as does the Alcoa verdict now. If convicted, Microsoft would be guilty of this crime: continuously adding features to its software, while bringing the price per function of its software to an all-time record low to the benefit of its millions of customers. The justice department once offered Microsoft a way out: agree to offer browser software from its competitor, Netscape. I respect Bill Gates for rejecting what might have been a relatively painless escape and for litigating the issue on principle. Think about the topics of the last few minutes: pork-barrel politics and laws limiting freedom by creating new classes of criminals. Why would we ever voluntarily involve ourselves in the Washington morass? Technet, a Bad Idea Technet is a new Silicon Valley lobbying organization. Its website shows a cartoon of a Silicon Valley nerd shaking hands with a Washington bureaucrat. Technet could be the unofficial embassy that normalizes our relationship with Washington. That would be a very bad idea. When I asked my assistant ``who the hell runs that organization,'' she gave me a list of its directors, which included two venture capitalists who funded Cypress in 1983, two investment bankers who brought Cypress public in 1986, a former member of Cypress's board of directors, four CEOs of respected Silicon Valley chip companies, four CEOs of important Cypress customers, and Cypress's current chairman of the board of directors. At that point, I thought my criticism of Technet might best be done with diplomacy, but unfortunately, I lack the diplomacy gene. I opposed Technet prior to its founding. Technet was an extension of the anti-Proposition 211 initiative. After the victory over 211 there was a leftover contributions kitty, and I was asked to leave in Cypress's share to fund other political endeavors, like contributing to politicians who support Silicon Valley. My refusal letter read as follows: I am really speaking out against that pork-barrel system. Why else would I lobby against Sematech, a subsidy for my own industry? I also lobbied against the Department of Commerce--to abolish it--specifically because it is one primary vehicle of corporate welfare. Given that mindset, you can understand how I would never support a politician like Anna Eshoo [a local Silicon Valley Democratic congresswoman]. She may agree with us on one or two technology issues to save her political butt, but she is a liberal-socialist who voted to increase taxes on all American corporations. She is the enemy, standing against everything I stand for. It is only an accident of political expediency that causes her ever to be on the same side of a given issue. Just as I wouldn't give money to PBS television, to be used to batter free markets and corporations, I don't give money to politicians to buy their vote on any given issue. I guess you could say that I was adamantly opposed to Technet, even before it got started. At least Technet is honest in its support of the pay-for-play Washington system. Here is an excerpt from a typical Technet email: I would like to call your attention to two congressman who have recently visited Silicon Valley and who have played a key role in our * * * success. Rep. Billy Tauzin * * * and Rep. Mike Oxley * * * We'll be following up with phone calls and emails to ask for your financial support for these two friends. We hope you will consider making a $1,000 donation to each of them. It seems that Technet agrees with Will Rogers' observation that ``America has the best Congress that money can buy.'' In fairness to Technet, I should mention that its two current initiatives are K-12 education reform, and the Unified National Standards Act, yet another law designed to eliminate frivolous shareholder lawsuits, one necessitated by the fact that securities lawyers now sue companies in both state and Federal courts, under two sets of rules, making securities lawsuits even more painful and expensive. Since Technet is not about to close up shop based on my criticism, I hope it will at least follow this advice: Never lobby for pork-barrel measures; Never move headquarters to Washington (the demise of other lobbying organizations); Never lobby for a narrow issue like beating Microsoft at the expense of a fundamental issue like government control over free markets. John Doerr, Venture Capitalist John Doerr was a leader in the victory over Proposition 211, and is currently a Technet leader. The press has singled him out as the icon for the political greening of Silicon Valley. John has supported the current administration, and there is talk in the Valley about ``Gore and Doerr in 2004.'' In addition, John is a general partner at Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, one of the firms that funded Cypress. He also served on Cypress's board of directors for 10 years. And he is a friend of mine. Once I stated in a magazine interview that John Doerr would be better off if he stayed home and did his job as a venture capitalist. John read my remarks and reasonably misinterpreted them as criticism. He shot back in another magazine article that I was a ``cowboy entrepreneur'' who needed to think beyond the confines of Silicon Valley. After that, I called John to explain to him in detail what I meant by my statement. First, I got him to agree with my premise that the biggest success he could have at Technet would be to get the Unified National Standards litigation law passed quickly and efficiently. (Today, he would probably also add improving K-12 education as a big goal.) Once we had established the definition of success for John Doerr at Technet, I reminded John of the success he had already achieved as a venture capitalist. What I said to him was a lighterweight version of the following statement, which I have enhanced by reading through the reports I receive from Kleiner-Perkins: John, in addition to starting Cypress, you and your firm also started eight other chip companies--including big winners like LSI Logic, VLSI Technology and Xilinx--companies with $4.7 billion a year in revenue and 16,400 employees. By funding such companies as America Online and Netscape, you commercialized the Internet and then enriched it by funding companies like Amazon.com that put the bookstore on line. In addition to that, I am aware of a dozen or more new companies Kleiner-Perkins has funded that will literally define the future of the Internet. You and your partners also launched the biotech industry by funding not only Genentech, but 20 more biotech and healthcare companies that fix vision with lasers, perform genetic engineering, create skin tissue to repair burns, make ultralow- dosage X-ray machines, and produce equipment for use in spinal surgery. One of your companies could literally cure cancer. And you and your partners, along with the network of Silicon Valley venture capitalists, have funded those amazing companies that have revolutionized our country--for less money than it takes to build a single warship. John, who is more valuable to us? John Doerr, the lobbyist who can get the Unified National Standards Act enacted, or John Doerr, the venture capitalist who has helped change the world? John, we can't afford to send you to Washington. How could John Doerr respond to that? He said, ``Well, when you put it like that * * *.'' John Doerr is a great example of the enhanced value of an individual in a capitalist society. The example also dramatically illustrates the efficiency of free-market investments, compared with the investments of collectivist organizations. With the money to buy one warship, the Politburo probably would have bought one more warship, later to be mothballed. Japanese and Korean collectivists probably would have added another unneeded semiconductor memory plant to acerbate the current chip glut which is so severe it has devastated the Japanese and Korean economies. In Silicon Valley, with the same money, John and the network of venture capitalists built an economic battleship that generates wealth from the private property of ideas traded in a free market. Washington builds battleships, battleship laws, and battleship bureaucracies. That's why we shouldn't normalize our relationship with it. To do so would be to choose against capitalism and freedom. When we see the government attacking our successes, such as Microsoft and Intel, we should stand together to defend that attack on free markets. And when we see the government seizing the assets of tobacco companies, we should not be quiet because we don't like tobacco. The obscenity of Federal and state attorneys general lining up like plaintiffs' attorneys to confiscate the assets of a company will surely be repeated. Right now, Washington is already calling the much-publicized ``Year 2000'' problem a ``chip problem.'' I won't waste your time on the technological absurdity of that position. The point is that if we sit back while the government illegally seizes the assets of the tobacco companies, we may find the same carpetbagging attorneys suing to gain Silicon Valley's assets soon after January 1, 2000. Silicon Valley is an island of capitalism and freedom admired around the world. We must remember that free minds and free markets are the moral foundation that have enabled our success. And never allow those freedoms to be diminished for any reason. Chairman Kasich. I want to really compliment all three of you for just outstanding testimony. I have just one or two questions and then I will recognize Mr. Ryan. Mr. Miller, you make a very compelling argument. What does the other side say? Mr. Miller. The other side will say it is jobs and they can't compete in the world market. But they say you have subsidized sugar elsewhere around the world. We have subsidized sugar in France but we have laws keeping subsidized products from coming into the United States so that is not a valid argument. Yes, if they have to compete in the world market you may lose a few jobs but agriculture is a huge net exporter for this country as far as our ability to compete. We should be able to compete. When you start protecting industries, as we have with sugar, you are making them less efficient and you are enriching a very small number. So the argument they will make, we will lose jobs. But I say you are losing jobs from the companies like candy companies and cereal companies. Congressman Don Manzullo, from the Chicago area, says he has a cough drop company that won't move the rest of their facilities from England because sugar is too expensive in the United States. Soft drinks, Coke and Pepsi no longer use sugar in their drinks in the United States because sugar is too expensive. So we have cost jobs even though some people with individual sugar growing districts would argue that. That is the only argument they can make. Chairman Kasich. What do you three gentlemen think we can do to get something accomplished on these fronts? And I know that you all share each other's feelings about your specific testimony. Why don't we start with you, Mr. Shadegg. What are we going to do to--what is it going to take to be successful in your judgment? Mr. Shadegg. I think it is extremely difficult to succeed in this area in this climate because you see just yesterday the Federal budget apparently is going to sustain an additional windfall and more revenues and I think some of the pressure that was there when we first started down this road may well be gone. But I do think that American politics is driven by fundamental fairness and I think as my colleague Mr. Miller pointed out, there are always winners, and Mr. Sununu made the same point. There are always winners and losers in each of these programs. The sugar subsidy is a good example of that. The power marketing administrations are good examples of that where some people are winning and benefiting and others are hurting, and yet I think it is clear that in each and every example of corporate welfare, if the program were eliminated and in some cases you have to eliminate it in a careful and methodical fashion so you minimize the losses and maximize the benefits of the program, at the end of the day doing away with these corporate welfare subsidies will benefit all of the taxpayers, make more dollars available. So I think it is largely an education effort so that people understand two things, one that the winners really aren't winning all that much and second, that it is not justified. I think that is completely--a completely fair description of, for example, the power marketing administrations, the sugar subsidy, and so many others, as Mr. Sununu pointed out, where government picks a winner or loser and typically picks an inefficient winner punishing everybody else for that agency. Chairman Kasich. What approach do you have in terms of eliminating the Department of Energy? Where are you at this point? Mr. Shadegg. Well, quite frankly, Todd Tiahrt has the lead legislation in this area and has had for the last several congresses. I think he is doing the right thing. Your colleague Mac Thornberry is noted as being in the morning paper, the Hill, in trying to work in some restructuring in those areas where the Department of Energy should continue to remain active, the labs themselves. And yet, as you see, he is being punished by the Secretary of Energy for his efforts and there are threats to fire employees inside the department who are cooperating with Max's efforts. I think you said the right thing. I think what we have to do with regard to the Department of Energy is sort out that which needs to be done and should be done. Clearly we have to have some weapons labs. Clearly there are some other programs within those departments which should continue. But there are quite clearly also many, many, many programs. Indeed, I would suggest perhaps more than half of the department's budget which could be flat eliminated without having a loss. Like any other institution, it has sought to perpetuate itself. With the end of the Cold War, the demands on the Department of Energy weapons labs have diminished and yet they wanted it to serve a need so you have seen private industry become much more involved in those labs. It is taking advantage of those labs and we are wasting millions if not billions of taxpayer dollars. I think we have to do a very, very aggressive job at looking at what should just be gotten rid of completely, done away with, gone, finished. And I think that we have a window of opportunity to do that now because of the security breaches which has caused everyone to focus on what is wrong at the lab. Chairman Kasich. Mr. Miller, what challenges do you have and how do we---- Mr. Miller. Speaking about sugar specifically, during the authorization bill in 1995 we came within five votes of the House. It came very close. This had good bipartisan support. It was the Miller-Schumer bill. Congressman Schumer is now Senator Schumer and he is leading the effort over in the Senate side. Now it is the Miller and Miller bill with George Miller. George Miller and Dan Miller don't always vote alike but we agree on this issue. The broader we can get our coalition to support this the better. It is going to be a perseverance effort. We have got to stick with it. As you know a few years ago we used to have a wool mohair program. We had a honey program. It was just year after year you just keep hammering away at the program. The American people get tired of this. There was an article in Readers Digest not long ago about the sugar program. NBC's the ``Fleecing of America'' did a piece about the sugar program. Time magazine has done an article. The more the American people get fed up with this program, raise it with their representatives, Democrat and Republican, the better the chance we will have to do it. Now, with the sugar program you can't just go to the Agriculture Committee and ask for them to get rid of the program. They are not going to do it. I testified before them and they are not as friendly a group as we have here in the room today. But the fact is it has got to come up for reauthorization. When we reauthorize programs as discussed earlier by the budget questions, that is the opportunity we have that we should force the fights on these issues and we need to build up that coalition and just don't give up, and that is the position I am taking. Chairman Kasich. Is there any dispute about the impact on the Everglades? Mr. Miller. No, there is no dispute. We are going to spend in the $10 billion range to restore the Everglades but sugar is only one of the contributing factors. It is not the only cause of it. But the problem is they are only going to contribute roughly 2 percent to the total cost of the restoration of the Everglades yet they are a major contributor of the problem. One of the other irritating things about this program is that one of the solutions of the Everglades is buying up land to filter the water as it goes through the Everglades. We are buying the land from the sugar growers and we are paying an inflated price for the land because of the sugar program, which makes no sense. And so we really got a double hit in that area. Chairman Kasich. Mr. Sununu. Mr. Sununu. I think to answer your question about what can be done, I would begin with enforcing and doing everything we can to enforce fiscal restraint of these spending caps, the budgetary caps, because what they have done over the last 4 or 5 years is to force choices to be made. And as a result, we have seen that in programs like Advanced Technology Program, there has been a reduction, not the elimination of the program, but a reduction in the funding. In the case of fossil fuel R&D or clean coal R&D, programs that have been very ineffective, we have seen a reduction in funding. So the pressure of the budget caps have forced us to make some choices and in this case good choices by minimizing the amount of funding that is going to these subsidies and these market distortions. I think budget process reform is part of the answer, focusing on the needs to ensure that programs are either authorized or they don't get funded. Sunsetting programs was talked about earlier by the first panel and finally to focus our efforts as you have suggested, Mr. Chairman, the opportunity to create a coalition and to focus on one or two programs, achieve success in those areas, and then move on in order to highlight the fact that with a little bit of unity and a little bit of focus of resources and effort we can be successful in energizing the public, getting them to recognize how much of their money is being wasted on these programs and then make a difference. Chairman Kasich. Mr. Ryan is recognized. Mr. Ryan of Wisconsin. I want to thank the Members for coming here today. I am a new Member of Congress and I came with a little bit of experience here and I witnessed in the 104th Congress tremendous amount of momentum in the direction of eliminating the Department of Commerce and the Department of Energy, and eliminating the sugar subsidy five votes short. The momentum was there and it seemed to be based upon a philosophical principle that no longer should the government be involved in picking winners and losers in the marketplace but that the taxpayers through the private free market should do those types of decision making. It seems like we have strayed from that goal, strayed from that vision, strayed from those principles and although the discretionary budget caps helped put pressure on these things, I wanted to ask you since you as Members of Congress, Dan, I think you are in your fourth term, and John, you are in your second--why? What has been happening? Why have we lost momentum on this point? Let's go to the senior one, Representative Miller. Mr. Miller. Well, there is a broad coalition of support for these programs unfortunately. I will stay with sugar since that is what my specific topic is today. We have a great coalition opposing the sugar program. We have consumer groups which recognize what a regressive tax is. We have the environmental community strongly supporting us on this. We have all the conservative anti-big government groups against this. And anybody that uses sugar is against it. Now, who's in on the other side? It is only the small group of sugar growers. But again, they just team up with other people. I have to scratch my head how other conservatives justify this program. I was a little baffled when I went through the fight in '95. But the frustration now is it will not be up for reauthorization until 2002. When we can sunset things and force them up for authorization, we have a real fight. Trying to do it through the appropriations process, which is the committee I serve on, is not where the battle should be. You are not going to get a free standing bill up there. We have to gear up for the reauthorization. I think the more we can force authorizations and allow those fights to take place, we are going to have some victories. So we are going to have some victories but we are going to have to keep perservering. Mr. Ryan of Wisconsin. If I could add to your point and as a cosponsor of your bill I think the environmental concerns were important and valid ones but in my district there are jobs concerns. Nestle's has a plant in Burlington, Wisconsin which we call Chocolate City, U.S.A. In Burlington, Wisconsin we do Nestle's Quick, which is the milk powder you add. We do the Nestle's crunch bars. We do the big size, the little bite size. Nestle's employs about 400 people there in Burlington, Wisconsin. It is a state of the art plant. They want to expand in this plant but they will not do so because of the price of sugar. We have a milk system that also is out of whack and I won't get into that but Nestle's wants to employ more people in Chocolate U.S.A. Because it is a great community to build a plant in to build more jobs, but because of the price of sugar these jobs are not going to be created. They will actually be created in other plants they have overseas. Now, it seems to me that we are at a critical philosophical juncture. Where are we going to decide that the nucleus of our economy is? Washington and bureaucrats and the Department of Commerce, Energy, and other places which are going to pick the winners and losers in the marketplace or are we going to go back with the Constitution and the idea that the individuals are the nucleus of our economy. That seems to be where we are right now. You know, we have asked welfare mothers to go back to work and earn a paycheck instead of going to the mailbox to get a welfare check. It seems to me that is very fitting to ask big corporations who are getting corporate welfare checks from Washington to go out and earn a profit and go back to work themselves instead of coming to Washington for a handout. It seems only logical. I would like to ask Congressman Sununu a couple of quick questions about the Department of Commerce. I believe that was an agency created in 1910 and has evolved so much over the years. What do you think are other ways that we can do to pursue the advancement of commerce and do you believe that the Department of Commerce needs to exist? I know your answer on that one, but has it outlived its use on this and is it a tool of economic development encouraging economic growth or is it a barrier toward economic development and economic growth? Mr. Sununu. I think in a lot of respects it is a barrier to economic growth. But let me talk a little bit about what exactly the dismantling act would entail because as is the case with the Department of Energy, there are components of the Department of Commerce that really can provide long-term value and that in fact in some ways ought to be given greater independence. Specifically the National Weather Service and NOAA. The bill would establish--would consolidate the oceanographic and atmospheric and scientific functions of NOAA within a much more independent National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. It would bring together the Bureau of Standards, spectrum research, the National Telecommunications Information Administration and the Office of Space Commerce, bring all of these within the core functions of NOAA and preserve the functions of the National Weather Service. But at the same time it would, one, consolidate all of the duplicative agencies that handle trade functions which include the International Trade Administration, the Bureau of Export Administration, the Office of the United States Trade Representative, and the Inspector Management within the U.S. Trade Administration, bring those all together into a single trade agency. It would terminate some of the unnecessary programs that I spoke about earlier, the agencies of the EDA, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and the Technology Administration that simply have outlived their usefulness if they ever had any usefulness in the first place. And then it would wipe out certain department programs like the Office of Technology Program, the NOAA Fleet, and the Advanced Technology Program that are counterproductive as you described earlier or even the grant programs under the National Telecommunications and Information Administration that oftentimes are targeted at specific states. Just to go down a few programs and it is not necessarily a specific criticism of what might be produced by the program, but you certainly have to question whether it is a Federal function at all or whether it belongs in the Department of Commerce when we have a sea grant oyster disease account, zebra mussel account, the mussel program, the Charleston, South Carolina special management plan, the Chesapeake Bay observation buoys. These may or may not be worthwhile programs but is it really a Federal responsibility? And in some cases if there is going to be funding and research it ought to be done through agriculture or through the fish and wildlife in the Interior bill. There simply is not a need for a stand-alone Department of Commerce that is picking the winners and losers in our economy. Mr. Ryan of Wisconsin. Could I ask each of you this question. What are the savings estimates on the different bills you are talking about and what would be the 1-year savings estimates? Mr. Shadegg. Let me start. I would like to if I could, comment briefly on your first question because I think that was a very important question. What is the difference in the dynamic from 1994 when we first came in, and I know you were here then, not in the same capacity, and now? I think it is a function of the law of diffused interest versus concentrated interests. A reality is that each of these programs has a concentrated interest which supports it, which is a very, very small portion of the overall economy. Those who benefit from the sugar subsidy, those who benefit from the power marketing administration. Those are concentrated interests. The interests in favor of the greater good, not wasting the money on these programs is a diffused interest. On any given program those who object to it and are being hurt by it are being hurt to a very, very small degree. Those who are benefiting, for them it is life and death. I think in 1994 we came here with an overall purpose of looking at the scope of the Federal Government. We were looking at the big picture and we were willing to focus on those diffused interests and the concentrated interests hadn't been able to respond. I think you cite a very good example of where we were successful. Welfare reform is a good example of where we looked at the program. There was a diffused interest in eliminating it, but there had been enough publicity on the abuses in welfare that that diffused group of all Americans said look, welfare isn't working. That was fundamentally the objection and so we were able to overcome the resistance of the concentrated interests, those they believed to be benefiting from the current system. As it turns out, we were right. People who were benefiting under or thought they were benefiting under the old system hadn't been benefiting, weren't benefiting. They are much better off now than they were then and that has been demonstrated all across the country. I think then is the message of how we recapture that. I don't think without the change in control of the Congress you can ever have that broad range of power to take on concentrated interests in the interest of the greater good, the larger. So I think what we have to do is focus, focus as a Congress, focus as a Federal Government on specific programs, educate the American people on why those specific programs are bad, the sugar industry--subsidy being an example, the power marketing administration being an example. Point out how those are hurting everybody and not working and then we can realize kind of the greater good. You can empower the diffused interest to overcome the powers of the concentrated interest. As for your last question, the subsidy of the power marketing administrations is about--I am just talking about SEPA, SWPA, and WAPA--is about $300 million per year. The revenue estimates from the sale depending upon whether you do a sale to the highest bidder, which I think is politically impossible because the concentrated interest of the people that are getting cheap power will block you or whether you do a voucher privatization like the Czech Republic, as I mentioned in my testimony, where you allow the people currently benefiting from subsidized PMA power to get an economic benefit. I have a friend who worked here in Washington for a while, an economist, Hoover Institute trained economist, who in discussing the power market administration said, look, it may be a subsidy but they stole it fair and square. And what he was saying was the people benefiting from the PMAs have that right right now and it's difficult to take it away from them. That is why I think it is important to become a genius. The legislation we wrote says, all right, you are getting it back right now. Let's reward you. Let's let those people getting subsidized public power benefit from the sale of the PMAs and quite frankly legislation proposes that they be sold to those same people so they stay in control. We give them an economic incentive to stay happy with a privatization. It worked in the Czech Republic. I think it can work here. It can overcome the power of their concentrated resistance. Mr. Ryan of Wisconsin. One of the reasons why I asked about the scores, is because I see rising out of your testimony possibly a new strategy and a new consensus of how to elevate the diffused interests, and that is this. Congressman Sununu, you mentioned that the pressure of living under the discretionary spending caps has helped us pursue these goals of eliminating corporate welfare. Well, that pressure is really mounting right now. And these discretionary spending caps as we designed them in the Budget Committee revolve around the goal of protecting the Social Security trust fund, revolve around the goal of saying every penny of Social Security taxes you pay should go to Social Security, period, end of story, and take that off budget. Then what you are left with is a quandary we have right here in Congress this summer with the spending caps with our appropriation bills. We are now at a point of deciding priorities and spending within the Federal Government and there are obviously different degrees of these priorities. Do we help with veterans health care? Do we help with education, other types of programs? And when you put these corporate welfare programs against these programs, when we are coming under tremendous pressure to stick to the discretionary spending caps, which we all support doing and on top of that support the discontinuation of the raid on Social Security, I think the diffused consensus, the diffused effort to try and go after these corporate welfare programs is significantly buttressed. That is why I asked what kind of money are you talking about that we are going to save and can we transfer that money into our priorities within the discretionary budget caps? Mr. Sununu. Congressman, in the case of the Department of Commerce legislation, there is in excess of $700 million in direct grants from the programs that provide the largest amount of grants to either otherwise profitable corporations or entities that really aren't deserving of those grants and then through the consolidation of the trade functions and the consolidation of the oceanographic and weather functions I think it would be very realistic to realize in excess of $300 million in savings, which would bring the total savings on an annual basis to over a billion dollars. Mr. Ryan of Wisconsin. It is a lot of money. Mr. Miller. The sugar program the General Accounting Office estimates it is over a billion dollar cost to the American consumer. It is rather shrewd the way the program was developed. Actually, on paper the Federal Government makes a little money from the sugar program because the sugar growers are in effect taxed to keep the program going. The Federal Government makes about $50 million off of it. However, the General Accounting Office also looked at what the sugar program costs the Federal Government and it is over a $100 million because we are a huge purchaser of food products, food stamps, veterans hospital, military facilities that provide food. So there is a real cost but the thing is it is just bad economics. It is bad for trade. It is bad for the environment. It has got all the other bad reasons. Mr. Ryan of Wisconsin. Thank you very much, gentlemen. I yield back the balance of my time. Chairman Kasich. Mr. Wamp has one question and then we will get to former member Bob Shamansky before we go to a vote. Zach? Mr. Wamp? Mr. Wamp. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a quick statement about farm subsidies. When people ask me after four and a half years of serving in the House what surprises me the most, it is always my first response that somehow agriculture subsidies and the whole price support system have survived this changeover in mentality from Democrats to Republicans. Agriculture is just so institutionally prominent around here. I still can't believe that we say we are reforming things, but it continues on. I oppose them all, and I commend you for continuing to push this issue even though it gets drowned out by so many other issues and even though there is such a bipartisan coalition behind the continuation of these programs. But my question, Mr. Shadegg, is about the Department of Energy. I would first ask that we are careful in painting everything at DOE with the same brush. Clearly there are a lot of problems with weapons labs, security and espionage, et cetera, et cetera. We all know about that now. But if you look at the multipurpose laboratories, like Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which I represent, Argonne, Brookhaven, and the other labs, there is a lot of positive science taking place. The only caution I would raise as we evaluate the effectiveness of the Department of Energy, and I am disappointed as well even though I have a site in my district with the management by the Department of Energy, that we are careful to not lose any of the equity that the government has in these multipurpose laboratories and the value of the laboratories. As we look at your proposal, for instance, how would we address the management of the science investment that this Federal Government has? Basic research is a legitimate Federal Government role and we need to protect those facilities where we have so much value coming to not just the government but directly to the people in this country. I would also say when we first were elected, you and I together and came here, the Galvin report had just come out. It assessed the role of the national laboratories, because we as a nation have not come to grips with what is the role of the laboratories in the post Cold War era. For over 50 years our national laboratory system was driven by one thing, one mandate: To be nuclear supreme as a nation. Well, we accomplished that. Cold War is over. We are the most supreme nation in the history of the world in terms of this. The buildup and the science investment was all predicated on national security needs. We haven't established as a nation yet what is the role of our national laboratory system in the post Cold War era. As you look at reform proposals for DOE or anybody else that is in the science and basic research business, we need to say where are we headed? What are we trying to do? Are we going to try to keep people alive and be a hundred years old? What is the mission? What is going to drive this investment? Otherwise it ends up being an annual maintenance obligation as opposed to a real vision for our country. Mr. Shadegg. Mr. Shadegg. I would agree with you that the fundamental question is what should the role be. I think I would also completely agree that in this post Cold War era, the role of the laboratories deserves to be reexamined. In an earlier exchange between myself and the chairman, we talked about the fact when you do an audit of DOE, you need to look at what functions that it is important that it continue to do and I think the labs fall in that category, but there are things that even the labs are doing that may not even be necessary. I cited an example of a program where Sandia Lab is working on improving the fireworks at Disney Land, a $300 million program. Why do we need that? I think it is very important that we ask what are the functions of the Department of Energy, are they properly organized and where should they be located in structure? Clearly the work of the weapons labs needs to go on, needs to go on under government supervision and is extremely important. I don't believe you were here for that part of my testimony, but President Clinton had the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board undertake a review of the labs themselves, particularly the weapons labs, and look at what is going on and their report was scathing. I think you put your finger on it correctly. We need to make careful decisions about which functions are important, what goals we want them to achieve. Beginning--there are critical comments which I went over in researching my remarks for today. There are critical comments about the structure of the Department of Energy and about its lack of mission from literally the day of its creation, and I listened to my colleague Mr. Sununu's comments about the criticisms of the Commerce Department being a hall closet in which you throw everything that you don't know what to do with. I think that is what we have done with DOE and I think it is time to sort it back out, decide what should be within the capacity of DOE, what should the structure be, but also, and the chairman and I talked about this, what things can we flat out eliminate that the government simply has no business being involved in, and that, as I think Mr. Sununu eloquently pointed out, when the government picks winners and says, well, we will subsidize this activity but not that one, we will aid this industry but not that one, we are acting in a way which is antithetical to the premise behind this country, which is an individual initiative ought to be the driving force in our economy and ought to be rewarded, not bureaucratic allocation of money or power. Chairman Kasich. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized. Mr. Chambliss. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize for not being here. I was over in Agriculture Committee dealing with another favorite subject of my friend from Florida, the dairy program. We were talking about something over there that is very appropriate when we talk about the sugar program. Dan and I have had many conversations about this, and while I have no parochial interest in sugar, I very much have a parochial interest in agriculture. In spite of what my friend from Tennessee says, there is a place for Federal Government in agriculture. That place may not be exactly where we are today and where we ought to end up from a Federal perspective but, you know, we don't play on a level playing field in the world market. We keep talking about putting our farmers into the world market. A lot of our crops simply don't have a world market, number one, because of the high subsidies that are paid by other countries and the ability of our farmers to compete is just not there. And I think the sugar program is a classic example of that. Dan, you are right, there are--there have been changes in that program. They may not have been changes that seemed to be positive but changes that created a positive flow into the U.S. Treasury from the sugar program. There is a tax on sugar growers. It has created anywhere from $3 million to $68 million in positive cash flow into the U.S. Treasury over the last 15 years since 1985, when that program truly went to a no net cost program to the taxpayer. Now, again, you may be right that it has cost attached to it to the standpoint of having to treat veterans at hospitals or other health care related incidents, but my gosh, what does salt do to people? We can't go into dealing with the cost to the government from agriculture products and determine which ones we are going to try to regulate to a heavier extent based upon health care issues. Be that as it may, we are headed down a road that we have been traveling for the last 5 years, which I think is a very good road, and that is getting the government more and more out of the agricultural arena. But when we put our charts up back in 1995 and we showed to the American farmer we are going to start reducing the influence of the government in your markets and put you more in the world market, we had that on one side of the chart. And on the other side of the chart, we also had benefits that were going to flow to those folks to make the playing field level, benefits such as reduced regulation. Have we done that? No. We are going to have reduction in taxes. Have we done that? To a limited extent we have. But there were any number of other items over there that we were going to use to offset the bottom line problem that that farmer was going to have in the long run through a change in agriculture policy. We need to do a better job of keeping our farmers in business, and the sugar program is one that simply doesn't cost the American taxpayer anything. The sugar farmer that participates in the program and gets a loan from CCC has to pay the loan back, and in the last 10 years, the only two loans that have been in default on the part of the farmer have created a positive inflow into the U.S. Treasury because the government wound up selling the collateral for more than the loan amount. So there has simply been a positive cash flow in the sugar program by the sugar program into the U.S. Treasury that doesn't translate into corporate welfare in any way you look at it. Now does it cost the consumer more? Now that is an issue that I guess we could argue, but it is not really material to the argument of corporate welfare, but when you look at the numbers again, since 1990, the amount of the world--of the price for raw sugar that was paid to the producer has decreased by 13 percent. Now, has a bar of candy decreased by 13 percent at the retail level? Has the price of any sweetened products-- any products sweetened by sugar decreased at the retail level by any amount? And I submit to you that you just can't show me a product that has decreased by any amount even though the price to the farmer has decreased over the last 10 years by 13 percent. So I would stand and argue with you, Dan, that when we look at programs such as our agriculture programs and, in particular sugar, that there is no corporate welfare there, and I am sorry I missed your testimony, but I have heard it before so I know exactly what you said. Mr. Miller. May I respond? I need to--with all due respect, I need to disagree with you. General Accounting Office, which is the neutral authority in this, says it cost the American consumer over a billion dollars a year and consumers are taxpayers, and actually, they are very shrewd, this sugar industry, to in effect create a tax on the sales to pay the government about this $50 million a year. To me it is the bribe to the Federal Government to keep the program going. But one thing--agriculture is very competitive in the world economy today. Tropicana is my largest employer in my district. Over 20 percent of their product is sold outside the United States. Over 50 percent of the fresh grapefruit raised in Florida is shipped outside the United States. We have got more citrus than we can sell in Florida, and we have got to find world markets for it, and we have got to open up those markets, whether it is in Japan, China or Europe, to sell our citrus, but if we say, well, we won't let you sell your sugar, but we want to sell our citrus, that is not how you negotiate a trade agreement. Our agriculture people have a huge net surplus in agricultural exports, as you well know. That is one of the shining parts of our export market today. So we need to open up markets, and if we are trying to defend and protect one, and sugar is about the only one that hasn't changed. They did some technical changes but the price of sugar is legislated at over 20 cents a pound, period. It has been that for the past 10 years. It won't go down because the Federal Government has this complicated process to keep it up there. So I think it cost the American consumer who is the American taxpayer. Mr. Chambliss. Let me just quickly respond to that, and that is what I said earlier. When the price to the producer goes down by 13 percent over the last 10 years, you should see a correlation to that savings on the part--at the retail level, and you just don't see it, Dan. You don't see it. I mean, the price of a candy bar has increased, if anything, by anywhere from 10 to 50 percent, in some particular instances that I know about, and it just doesn't work that way. Mr. Ryan of Wisconsin. If the gentleman will yield for a second, we have a vote coming up, but you mentioned you were doing an agricultural hearing marking up a bill to solidify the current status quo on dairy, and I could submit to you that part of the reason why we have had no reduction in the cost of candy bars, specifically chocolate candy bars, is because one of the factors for production, in addition to sugar, is milk, and we have an antiquated, Depression Era, socialized milk system right now that gives producers a higher price of milk. Producers in Florida based upon their geographic location and proximity to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, so we are paying farmers in Florida and New York, Arkansas, Alabama, more money to produce milk because they live farther away from Eau Claire, Wisconsin. And a big part of the reason why candy bars, chocolate candy bars haven't gone down so much is because of this antiquated, socialized milk system we have which in and of itself is a good example of corporate welfare. Chairman Kasich. You know, the steady, old hand of the chairman, you know, left the dais just for a few minutes, and now this has degenerated so badly. We got milk, sugar and peanuts if the truth be told. Anyway but I think---- Mr. Chambliss. Mr. Chairman, can I add just one thing, though? Now, I am going to agree with you. He hit on something that is absolutely essential for the future of agriculture and the future of these programs, and that is trade. You are right. There are problems. There is not a level playing field out there, and the way we can level it through good trade notions, and agriculture has not received a profile from a trade perspective that it needed to receive, and it is not just this administration. It is previous administrations also, but I think we are in an atmosphere now where we can make those changes and we can negotiate. If you eliminate the subsidies worldwide, then you are going to see significant changes in our programs, and our folks would be able to compete in whatever may be determined as the, quote, world market, unquote. Chairman Kasich. We are going to take a recess, but I know that we have got the next panel. Mr. Shamansky, who has been here all day, will be next, along with David Minge. We have two votes. One is 15 and then I think just a vote on final. So we should be able to get back--I will be back immediately and encourage the members to come back, but I think in a nutshell this kind of sums up the problem you have here when you have sugar yes, sugar no, milk. The key is how do we find the handful of issues that can get the momentum going, and it is going to be based upon a strong consensus, not just inside, but with the outside groups as well. I would anticipate we would be back here within 20 minutes. So the committee will stand in recess. [Short recess.] Chairman Kasich. The committee will come to order. We have got with us Congressman David Minge from Minnesota, and my friend from Columbus, Ohio, former member Bob Shamansky, and I think Bob, if you don't mind, we will start with David and then come to you, and David, the floor is yours. STATEMENT OF THE HON. DAVID MINGE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MINNESOTA Mr. Minge. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I would like to compliment you on scheduling this series of presentations today. We have had hearings on, so to speak, corporate welfare, and there is probably no area where this is more conspicuous and more egregious than what has been called the competition between the States or smokestack chasing, where one State is trying to raid a business, to raid another State to draw that State's business into its State, where we have professional sports teams who are playing one State off against another, one metropolitan area off against another, to see who will contribute the most money for a stadium, all of this being done at taxpayer expense. There is some examples of this that really stand out and define the nature and the magnitude of the problem. Let me take a 1993 agreement between the State of Alabama and Mercedes Benz. The State of Alabama and local units of governments in that State provided a subsidy package worth an estimated $250 million to build an auto plant in Alabama. Each of the jobs, estimated to be 1,500, that would be created by the project cost the people of the State of Alabama $168,000. Similarly, the Marriott Corporation, headquartered in Maryland, determined it needed to build and expand its headquarters facility. It looked across the Potomac to Virginia and started a bidding war between Virginia and Maryland. Before it was over it is estimated that as much as $70 million in subsidies from the State of Maryland are being provided to this very profitable and successful business corporation so that it would retain its headquarters in the Maryland area. Now, this is a contest among the States that many of us may stand here in Washington and look and say, well, gee, this is up to the States to figure this out, but the sad truth is the States can't do it on their own. It is like unilateral disarmament. If the States make a pledge that they are not going to engage in this type of smokestack chasing or raiding, that agreement is only successful until some State decides it is going to break the arrangement. Probably the longest running competition and the most often violated agreements are between New York and New Jersey. New Jersey with regularity tries to lure corporate headquarters or other facilities from Manhattan across the Hudson River, and they have been successful and New York responds, and then the States agree they won't do it anymore, and next thing you know they are up to the same type of conduct again. In Minnesota we face this in numerous settings, and it has reached the point where the Minnesota State legislature has petitioned Congress to take action to respond to this type of problem. The State legislative request was matched by a request from the governor of the State, and at least eight other states have made similar requests of Congress. We have the power under the commerce clause of the Constitution to regulate interstate commerce. It is our act. If we want to try to bring some order to this chaos, we can do so. If we choose not to, then this destructive competition among the States, at great expense to taxpayers, continues on from year to year. Mr. Chairman, in your own State of Ohio I am aware of a situation where the City of Cleveland struggled to keep the Cleveland Browns' ball team. It didn't want the team to move to Baltimore, and the city offered a package worth an estimated $175 million. Yet at the same time the public schools in Cleveland were in trouble. Eleven were closed in 1995 for lack of funding. Clearly, we have to identify our priorities in this country, and I believe that the citizens in almost every State agree that the priority is not tax subsidies to profitable business operations and to professional sports teams, but instead it is education, and if we are going to be of assistance to the States and the communities with reference to this destructive competition, the type of legislation that I have proposed is the most effective way to proceed. My bill, which is called the Distorting Subsidies Limitation Act, is H.R. 1060. I have worked on this with economists, with business development leaders and officials from a variety of locations around the country and received support for my effort, and I would just like to point out in closing that this is not a problem unique to the United States. Canada has had this problem. They have taken steps to address it. The European Union perhaps provides the best example. They have recognized that this type of destructive competition within the European Union can cost member countries hundreds of millions of dollars, and as a consequence as a part of the initial charter that was set up, a bureau was created that has the specific responsibility of dealing with this type of smokestack chasing situation in the European Union. I would urge that this committee recognize the importance of this type of legislation and that my colleagues on the committee join with me in pressing for a hearing before the appropriate committee in Congress and ultimately consideration on the floor in passage. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Minge follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. David Minge, a Representative in Congress From the State of Minnesota I am pleased by the opportunity to testify before the committee today on a type of corporate welfare that deeply concerns me due to the extensive cost to the taxpayer. States and cities across the country are competing against one another to lure companies that will provide jobs to local residents. This has been happening for years, and it probably always will, given our country's commitment to the free market economy and rigorous competition. Some localities simply do a better job of ensuring that their area has an educated workforce, efficient transportation infrastructure, and is generally more attractive to employers. That's one of the tenets of good government--create an environment that promotes economic growth and jobs. But in the last several years we have seen an increase in competition between the states based on something other than the quality of the roads, schools, or available labor force. Local governments are being forced to spend scarce taxpayer dollars for incentives to attract specific companies looking for a new home, or even more discouraging, just to keep a business from packing up and leaving town. This practice is wide spread. A 1993 Arizona Department of Revenue study found that half the 50 states had recently enacted financial incentives to induce companies to locate, stay or expand in the state. Targeted businesses have ranged from airline maintenance facilities, automobile assembly plants and professional sports teams to chopstick factories and corn processing facilities. These deals often range into the hundreds of millions of dollars. For example, Pennsylvania, bidding for a Volkswagen factory in 1978, gave a $71 million incentive package for a factory that was projected to eventually employ 20,000 workers. The factory never employed more than 6,000 and was closed within a decade. In a 1993 agreement with the State of Alabama, Mercedes received a sweetheart subsidy package worth $253 million to build an auto plant in that job-starved state. Each of the 1,500 jobs created cost the state taxpayers $168,000. And most recently, the Marriott Corporation gleaned what is estimated to be as much as $70 million in subsidies from the State of Maryland and Montgomery County to expand their operation. This firm has been headquartered for decades in the Free State, and has prospered nicely with the help of an educated and productive workforce. When company executives threatened to pick up and leave after 44 years in Maryland, and when they sat down with Virginia officials to discuss ``options,'' Maryland had little choice but pony up with $70 million in tax breaks and road projects or risk seeing Marriott ride into the sunset. While spending billions of dollars to retain and attract businesses, state and local governments struggle to provide such public goods as schools and libraries, public health and safety facilties, and the roads, bridges and parks that are critical to the success of any community. These subsidy deals have a direct effect on the availability and quality of public services. The city of Cleveland, while it struggled to keep the Cleveland Browns football team from moving to Baltimore, announced the closing of 11 schools in 1995 for lack of funding, yet the city offered to spend $175 million of public money to fix the Browns' stadium to ward off Baltimore's successful offer to attract the team. My own state of Minnesota is experiencing a similar dilemma. There has been a lot of talk in the last couple of years about the Minnesota Twins being lured away by a publicly financed stadium in another part of the country. That talk had quieted but has just recently reappeared on the front pages of Minnesota newspapers. The Twins have long been pressing the state and local government for a new sports stadium. It appears now that the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul are gearing up for a bidding war to publicly finance a new stadium to lure the team. This comes less than 2 years after the state legislature and the city of Minneapolis decided against financing a stadium. This is being played out around my state in even our smallest communities. I have had some personal experience with the issue when I served on the County Development Commission in my hometown of Montevideo in western Minnesota. I know from my own work how frustrating it can be for a smaller community to have to compete with communities that have deeper pockets or that are more willing to give breaks or go into debt to win a deal. All told, state and local government across the country provide more than $15 billion annually in tax rebates and other subsidies, according to Kenneth Thomas of the University of Missouri, St. Louis. That price tag is staggering. Those funds could educate 3 million elementary school students, hire 300,000 police officers or construct 6,000 miles of four-lane highway. Millions of dollars of bonds are issued every year by state and local governments to finance projects that benefit a specific business. These bonds are tax free because they were intended to finance schools, infrastructure and other civic improvements, not sweetheart deals to corporations or professional sports teams. It gets worse. Some of these distorting subsidies are financed through Federal tax dollars. The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) reports that Federal block grant funds are being used not only to create jobs, but subsidize the movement of jobs from one state to another. Why should the nation's taxpayers finance these deals that benefits job growth of one state to the detriment of another? Individual states and local governments are powerless to put a stop to the practice. Unilateral disarmament in this bidding war could mean the loss of thousands of jobs to other jurisdictions. At the same time, businesses cannot be blamed for wanting to move into a community that offers the best incentive package. What is clear is that the system itself is flawed, and that we are due for a tune up. We must start considering how to stop the use of tax subsidies that squander limited public resources and distort economic decision-making. I am encouraged that nine state governments, including the Minnesota Legislature, have passed resolutions urging Congress to find an answer to this lingering question. I have consulted with the Minnesota's Department of Trade and Economic Development, Mel Burstein and Art Rolnick of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, Ohio State Senator Charles Horn, local economic development planners and many others to develop legislation and build interest in resolving this problem. I have introduced a bill that is intended to end competition based on public giveaways rather than sound economic principles. The Distorting Subsidies Limitation Act of 1999 (HR 1060) requires businesses benefitting from special grants or tax deferrals to be taxed on the value of the subsidies at the same rates as currently apply to other income under the Federal corporate tax structure. Let's face it, these subsidies are income that businesses are milking out of local government. I think of this proposed tax as a ``sin tax'' meant to stop an undesirable activity. I also propose an across the board prohibition on the use of tax-exempt bonds or Federal resources by states and communities to lure businesses or prevent them from considering other locations. Several other Members of Congress have put together legislative proposals in attempt to halt these distorting subsidies. I salute their efforts, and hope that as concern about this unwise use of public resources continues to grow, we in Congress can hammer out a consensus approach. The point is that Congress is empowered by the Interstate Commerce Clause as the only entity that can put a stop to the economic war between the states. Mr. Chairman, U.S. Sugar policy does not belong in this hearing. No U.S. Sugar Subsidies or Quotas The U.S. government has made no payments to U.S. sugar producers in decades. Since 1985, consistent with Congressional intent, U.S. sugar policy has been run at no cost to the U.S. Treasury. Since 1991, U.S. sugar policy has been a revenue raiser, with significant ``marketing assessment'' funds contributed annually to the U.S. Treasury. Critics contend that other commodity programs were phased out in the 1996 Farm Bill. In fact, spending by USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation on these ``eliminated'' programs--such as foodgrains, feedgrains, oilseeds, and cotton--have risen from $4.6 billion in 1996 to an estimated $18.2 billion in 1999--and deservedly so, given the financial crisis in which American farmers now find themselves. Spending on sugar did not increase one penny during that time, even though producer prices for sugar, like other crops, have fallen since 1996. In fact, expenditures for sugar policy have remained at zero, while sugar policy revenues have averaged over $40 million per year. There are no longer any domestic quotas for sugar production. Any farmer that wants to raise sugar beets or any investor who wishes to establish a processing plant can do so. Production is a function of the domestic market economy. Response to Foreign Sugar Subsidies U.S. sugar policy is a necessary response to foreign sugar subsidies. In the absence of U.S. sugar policy, the U.S. would be swamped with subsidized foreign production and efficient American sugar farmers would be driven out of business. American sugar producers are competitive by world standards. They rank 18th lowest cost of 96 producing countries, most of these developing countries, despite American producers facing some of the world's highest government-imposed costs for labor and environmental protections. The world market, however, is distorted by enormous production and export subsidies. These subsidies leave the world market for sugar a thinly traded, highly volatile dump market, with price levels currently running barely one-fourth of the world average cost of producing sugar. If this Committee is looking for sugar subsidies, it would be far better advised to look to the European Union (EU). EU export subsidies on the sugar they dump on the world market are currently running about 25 cents per pound. That's nearly 40 percent higher even than the U.S. support price itself, which has been frozen at 18 cents per pound since 1985. It would be absurd to cut out the modest U.S. sugar policy while foreign governments, such as the European Union, continue their massive subsidies, which depress the world sugar market. We cannot allow foreign dump market sugar--produced by countries whose producers are less efficient than ours but who enjoy high subsidies--to drive competitive, unsubsidized American sugar producers out of business. Consumer Benefits In addition to the taxpayer benefits, consumers benefit strongly from U.S. sugar policy. American consumer prices for sugar are stable and low. The retail refined sugar price in this country has been virtually unchanged throughout the 1990's. Furthermore, our price is fully 32 percent lower than the average retail sugar price in the rest of the developed world. In terms of minutes worked to purchase one pound of sugar, we are virtually the lowest in the world, second only to tiny Singapore. Consumer Risks If U.S. sugar policy were removed, or the U.S. producer price for sugar further reduced, American consumers would see no benefit in the short run and be hurt in the long run. The food and candy manufacturers and retailers who oppose U.S. sugar policy can offer no assurance that they would pass their savings on lower ingredient prices along to consumers. A look at the past is revealing. For example, since 1990 the wholesale refined sugar price received by sugar producers has dropped nearly 13 percent. Meanwhile, the retail refined sugar price has not dropped at all, and retail prices charged for candy, ice cream, cookies, cakes, and other highly sweetened products have risen 20-30 percent. In the long run without a stable U.S. sugar policy, American producers would likely be forced out of business and we would become more dependent on the volatile world market. Consumers would face the risk that sugar prices would skyrocket as they have in the past. The food manufacturers and retailers do pass along higher costs. GAO Study Critics of U.S. sugar policy cite, as their sole source of economic analysis to support their cause, a 1993 study by the General Accounting Office that was requested by ardent sugar-producer foe Congressman Charles Schumer (D-NY). This study, which attempted to quantify consumer costs and theoretical producer benefits of U.S. sugar policy, has been slammed repeatedly by sugar market experts at USDA and at universities. Experts have excoriated the study because of its simplistic, and utterly false, assumptions. The GAO assumed the U.S. could take all its sweetener needs from the thinly traded, highly volatile sugar market-- increasing demand on that market by about 50 percent--without that market price rising at all, and that food manufacturers and retailers, who would have access to this endless supply, frozen at a low price, would then pass 100 percent of their savings on low sugar prices along to consumers. In fact, history has shown the actual passthrough is much closer to 0 percent. Jobs While job loss in the U.S. cane refining industry has been unfortunate, it has been far outweighed by the spectacular growth of jobs in the U.S. corn sweetener industry. During the mid-1980's, U.S. beverage manufacturers switched from sucrose sugar to lower-priced fructose corn sweeteners. As a result of the decreased demand for sugar, the U.S. imported less foreign raw cane sugar, some U.S. cane sugar refineries closed, and several hundred jobs were lost. However, this foreign-sourced cane sugar was replaced with domestically sourced corn sweeteners. The number of American jobs generated, directly and indirectly, by the growing and processing of U.S. corn for sweetener has been estimated at 247,715. U.S. consumers now benefit from access to U.S. corn sweeteners, the most inexpensively produced nutritive sweetener in the world, for more than half their sweetener needs. Trade Position The U.S. sugar import system is fully in compliance with all the United States' international trade commitments. The U.S. far exceeded its Uruguay Round Agreement (URA) commitment in the GATT. The URA required imports of at least 3-5 percent of domestic consumption; the United States bound its import quota at several times that, about 10-15 percent of consumption, and in some years has imported more than 20 percent of its consumption. Meanwhile, many major sugar-producing or consuming countries were required to make no changes in the URA, and many other foreign countries have yet to even minimally comply with their URA commitments. The United States has complied fully with its NAFTA commitments, though Mexico has reneged on its commitments regarding both corn sweeteners and sugar. Environment American growers and processors of sugar produce sugar in full compliance with the world's highest environmental standards. The Florida sugar industry is participating in an Everglades restoration project that has been approved by the state and Federal Governments, and sugar producers are way ahead of schedule in their water-runoff commitments. The closure of the sugar industries of Florida and the rest of the United States, which would be the inevitable result of legislation proposed by Congressman Miller, would shift sugar production from the United States--the country with the highest environmental standards--to the developing countries which dominate global sugar production, but have little or no environmental standards and enforcement. The global environment certainly would not benefit if we had to clear more Brazilian rain forests in order replace sugar grown in Florida and Minnesota. H.R. 1060: The Distorting Subsidies Limitation Act H.R. 1060, the Distorting Subsidies Limitation Act, introduced by Rep. David Minge (MN) is a comprehensive legislative initiative which attempts to curb the use of economic subsidies by state and local governments to lure or retain new or existing businesses. For several years, governmental entities have engaged in the use of targeted subsidies which include grants, below market loans or rent, and tax deferrals, aimed at a particular private business entity in an attempt to entice a business to a particular municipality. Because of these ``distorted subsidies'' state and local governments are being forced to compete against one another using scarce tax dollars that would otherwise be used for essential public goods and services such as schools, police and fire protection and road improvements. When state and local competition takes the form of preferential treatment for a specific business, it interferes with interstate commerce, distorts the allocation of resources, and leaves states to provide too few public goods and services. Nationally, one notorious example is the 1993 agreement between the state of Alabama and Mercedes Benz. Mercedes received a sweetheart subsidy package worth $253 million to build an auto plant. Each of the 1500 jobs created cost the taxpayers nearly $168,000 per job. In March, 1999, Rep. Minge introduced HR 1060 which requires businesses benefitting from special grants or tax deferrals to be taxed on the value of the subsidies at the same rates as currently apply to other income under the Federal corporate tax structure. The legislation would also impact the use of public funds for building sports stadiums. The proposed tax should be viewed as a ``sin tax'' meant to stop an undesirable activity. The less tax collected, the better. The goal is to stop the practice of corporations wheedling special deals from local governments and to encourage economic competition among states based on factors such as quality of services, reasonable and efficient regulatory policies and fair tax structures. Description of HR 1060, the Distorting Subsidies Limitation Act taxability of subsidies H.R. 1060 creates a Federal excise tax on businesses benefitting from special targeted economic subsidies. If a business accepts the economic subsidy offered by the state or local government, the subsidy will be subject to the excise tax which will be computed on the aggregate value of the subsidy for calendar year in which it was received. The rate of the tax will be the same that applies in determining the regular income tax of a corporation. The rates are as follows: Aggregate Total of Subsidy Tax Rate Less than $50,000 15% $50,001-$75,000 25% $75,000-$10,000,000 34% Above $10,000,000 35% The excise tax does not apply if the subsidy is part of the long- term taxing and spending policies of the governmental unit or if the subsidy is available to all business entities. definition of ``distorted subsidy'' The economic subsidies subject to the excise tax include: Any grant; Any contribution of property or services; Any right to use property or services; Any loan made available to a business at rates below those commercially available to taxpayers; Any tax deferrals or payment of any tax or fee; Any guarantee of any payment of any loan or lease; Any reduction for fees or other charges for the use of governmental facilities such as roads, sewage treatment facilities, and solid waste disposal facilities. There will be no excise tax rendered on the value of an economic subsidy which is provided for employee training or other educational programs. The legislation shall apply to any economic subsidy provided to a business 30 days after the date that this bill is enacted. tax exempt bond financing H.R. 1060 also denies the exemption from tax for interest on bonds providing targeted state or local government development subsidies for a specific business entity. The legislation shall apply to bond obligations issued after the enactment of this bill. federal funding H.R. 1060 prohibits the use of Federal funds by a state or local governmental unit for any targeted subsidies. If it is determined that Federal funds have been used for targeted subsidies, the bill provides for recovery of those funds from the governmental unit or the business entity.

Mr. Chambliss [presiding]. Thank you, David, and I am just sorry you weren't here for our little sugar debate earlier. I would have had some help. Mr. Minge. It sounds like it was a sweet discussion. Mr. Chambliss. Mr. Shamansky, welcome to the Budget Committee, and we look forward to hearing from you. STATEMENT OF THE HON. ROBERT SHAMANSKY, A FORMER REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Mr. Shamansky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank all the members of the committee and especially Chairman Kasich for the invitation to appear here today, but I will digress only to this extent right now and say that I am against legislative term limits, and the reason I say that, I cite myself as an example of why you don't need legislative term limits for Members of the House of Representatives because Mr. Kasich succeeded me from the 12th District. So I think that is pretty good proof you don't need legislative term limits. Approximately 80 million people invested their money in securities, both stocks and bonds, issued by businesses, which have made our market economy the most envied in the world. Those 80 million people include most likely a majority of the members of this committee, as well as a majority of the other people in this room. In fact, for the first time in history, the American people have more money invested in securities and other financial items than they do in their homes. Businesses have a choice of raising money within one State, such as Ohio, in which case they would register with the Division of Securities of the Ohio Department of Commerce. However, if those businesses want to raise large sums of money across the entire country, through our various stock exchanges, they must register voluntarily with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC. These national markets regulated by the SEC have trillions of dollars invested through them. One of the main reasons why Americans have invested in the securities markets is because the securities and exchange legislation passed in the 1930's has assured them that they would be treated fairly by the securities markets which come under Federal regulation. For example, such cases as Greater Iowa Corporation v. McLeldon are cited as holding that securities and exchange legislation has broad remedial purposes for the protection of the investing public and should be liberally and flexibly construed. This committee this day is performing one of the most important but too often unappreciated of its functions, which is that of investigation and oversight. Without this function would we have had the reforms of the abuses uncovered at the Internal Revenue Service? It is quite clear that the answer to that is a clear no. I became aware of some very unfair and indefensible practices by the securities industry the hard way. My aunt died in 1985, and I and a trust created by my late mother, my aunt's sister, were the beneficiaries of my aunt's estate. In the beginning of 1988, when I was gathering the Forms 1099 for the dividends from the stock I had inherited from my aunt, I discovered that I did not have a Form 1099 for the year 1987 for the most valuable stock I had inherited from her. When I contacted the transfer agent in New York I was told that I had not been sent a Form 1099 for the year 1987 because I had not received any dividends in 1987. The reason I had not received any dividends, they told me, was because dividend checks sent to me in 1986 had been returned to the transfer agent because they could not be delivered to the address the transfer agent was using. When a check like that was returned, no further dividends were mailed thereafter. I asked why they had not looked me up in the phone book because I had been at the same address since 1966. They said they never look up anybody in the phone book. I had to look them up. I asked, well, what if I had been made ill by a stroke and could not look anybody up. They said I still had to look them up. I asked, what if I were dead, and they said I still had to look them up. I asked, what if someone in your shop had been negligent in preparing my address. They said I still had to look them up. I pointed out that I was a lawyer and that they had just invented a new principle of American law, that is, they were negligent; I suffered because I did not receive any money nor the interest earned on my money; and they benefited from their negligence because they were using my money as an interest free loan; that is, they would turn over my principal but not the money earned by my money. They said I still had to look them up. I then noted that they had accumulated over $500 of my dividends over a period of four quarters and that over those four quarters or 1 year they could not find me. They agreed that they could not find me during that year. I asked them how long it would have taken them, a bank transfer agent, to look me up if I had owed them the $500? I have yet to receive an answer to that question. The answer of course is that it would have taken less than a minute and cost them less than one dollar to check me electronically in a database. You must understand what happened in that case. They only sent notices to any--on any check that had been returned to them. Now, clearly the address on the check that had been returned to them was no good, so they made a point thereafter only to send notices to the addresses that were already proven bad. That is guaranteed not to find anybody. In August 1992 I brought the subject of the unfair treatment of so-called lost security holders to the attention of my congressional classmate, now Senator Ron Wyden, who instantly grasped the significance of my disturbing experience. Ron, as chairman of a Subcommittee of the Committee on Small Business, wrote to Richard Breeden, then chairman of the SEC, twice that year. On February 22 of 1993, Chairman Breeden wrote Ron back in part as follows, ``although the absolute value of undeliverable accounts, about $10 billion according to the division's, that is the Division of Market Regulation, estimate is substantial, this is only one-tenth of 1 percent of the approximate $10 trillion capitalization of U.S. Equity and debt markets.'' In other words, $10 billion not belonging to them was just not enough to bother about. Based on the enclosed exhibits, and Mr. Chairman, I would ask you to make as part of the record the items---- Chairman Kasich. Without objection. Mr. Shamansky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Based on the enclosed exhibits and my direct experience with the Division of Market Regulation at the SEC, former Chairman Breeden's peremptory dismissal of the $10 billion in undeliverable accounts is a fair characterization of the culture or attitude of the Division of Market Regulation and the SEC itself toward millions of security holders who are owed billions of dollars of their own money. Understand this. This is not government money at any level. This is not any corporation's money, but this is the money belonging to you and me, the individual investor, and our market economy is dependent on encouraging individuals to put their money in the markets. In its October 7, 1997, release of the revised rules 17Ad.17, et cetera, the SEC said it had first estimated that there were 250 thousand lost security holders but that it later estimated that there were three million lost security holders, owed possibly more than $450 million. It is only fair to point out that the SEC was off by a factor of 12 between its first and last estimates of the number of lost security holders. Among those experts in this field that I am familiar with, most believe that the most recent estimate of about $450 million is too low, also, and I mention the disparity as a fair gauge of the expertise residing in the Division of Market Regulation at the SEC. Please understand that we are not talking about any money belonging to any government at any level nor to any money belonging to any corporation. We are talking about uniting owners of securities with their dividends and interests rightfully earned by their securities for which they paid their hard earned money. On July 28, 1993, the subcommittee staff presented to Chairman Wyden, as you know now Senator Wyden, a report entitled, ``Return to Sender Tens of Thousands of Undeliverable Dividend Payments in Limbo.'' ``Individual Investors Lose Billions of Dollars of Shareholder Assets Because of Lax Transfer Rules, Indifferences by Public Companies and Government Regulators.'' In addition to working with Senator Wyden and his staffs, I have been invited to speak before three annual meetings of the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators, otherwise known as NAUPA, and a national meeting of the Securities Transfer Association on the subject of lost security holders. Every State in the Union and the District of Columbia have unclaimed property laws which require holders of other people's money to turn over to the respective states, after periods of from 3 to 7 years, the money being held. The States have been doing this for decades, and they have all used public records, published originally in newspapers and at county and State fairs, and that are now published by a majority of states on the Internet. These states have been doing this without any security or privacy problems. It is important to repeat that. They don't have any privacy or security problems, and they have been doing it for decades. Likewise, corporations have procedures to check claimants for undelivered dividends and interest, and these procedures work very well. In other words, there are no privacy or security problems except in the minds of those who do not want the lost security owners to obtain their own money. The advent of the computer and the Internet has completely changed the way securities and their owners can be kept track of. We are no longer in the days of three by five cards shuffled by hand. As a surgeon should be held liable for negligence today, if he operated to repair a bone fracture without first using a readily available X-ray machine, so should those who transfer securities today if they refuse to use readily available databases, especially where that refusal benefits others than the owners of the securities. There are three very big credit rating agencies, companies which keep tab on almost every person in the United States who ever got credit or has made investments. When it comes to those who own stocks and bonds, their databases can find up to 80 percent or those sought, starting with either a name, an address or a Social Security number, which is on, I believe, every driver's license issued in the United States as required by Federal law. People who own stocks and bonds are not trying to hide from their own money. Almost without exception owners of stocks send in their Social Security numbers on a form W-9 to transfer agents so the transfer agents will not withhold 20 percent of the dividends for the IRS. People want to get their money, and the 50 States and the District of Columbia have demonstrated conclusively that there are no legal, ethical or other policy considerations such as privacy or security which prevent delivery to owners of securities the dividends and interest earned by their securities. It was my lot to bring to the attention of the SEC through Senator Wyden that the SEC was not assuring investors that they would have their dividends and interest delivered to them promptly, or at all, by the use of good databases. Under the SEC's existing regulations, specifying ``certificate detail,'' that is, they had to maintain ``the address of the registered security holder,'' the SEC had and has the authority of providing for the following common-sense, nonrocket science practices which were suggested to it by me as an investor in correspondence and/or during various meetings at the SEC. First, beside transfer agents, the regulations regarding lost security holders should apply to broker-dealers, corporate trustees, personal and institutional custodians and mutual funds, and issuers which do their own transfer work, because transfer agents maintain records for only approximately one- half of the security holders in the United States. The SEC in 1996 proposed changes to include recordkeeping broker-dealers, but then reversed itself in 1997, saying that changes only applied to recordkeeping transfer agents. Second, regulations, which apply to security holders lost on or after December 8, 1997, should apply equally to all security holders who had been lost before December 8, 1997. Here again, the SEC, especially the Division of Market Regulation, I will use a strong word, betrayed the shareholder because they then exposed the shareholder to the practices of the so-called heir-finders (they are called searchers or locators, or if you ask people who work for the States in the area of unclaimed property, some of them refer to these nice folks as either vampires, blood suckers or other nice things like that), because these are the people who will send you a letter and say, I know where $10,000 belongs to you and for from 25 percent to 50 percent, I will tell you where it is. And the States have tried to regulate this and it doesn't work. What happened then is that the SEC--and there is nothing in the regulation they adopted which could possibly justify this interpretation--the SEC on its own said if you were one of those unfortunate three million who were lost before December 8, 1997, you are still subject to that kind of treatment from these locators. Third, the lost security holder regulations should apply to security holders who meet the $25 de minimis test adopted by the SEC in 1997, if their checks remain uncashed for 7 months. The next regularly sent dividend and interest checks should inform the payee that a previously sent check had not been cashed and that the notice should request a call to a toll free number or other communication. There is sound precedent from the Prudential Insurance Company for notices like this, and I have conferred with the president of the First Chicago Trust Company of New York, one of the biggest of the transfer agents, and he agreed with his staff that it would cost it virtually nothing to make this change because the letters are being sent, all the papers are being sent, the postage being paid. It just says on the next regularly sent dividend payment, please cash your check. Matter of fact, just yesterday I picked up from my aunt, who is almost 94, a letter from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter asking about a check sent to her last December that wasn't cashed. There is no reason that this should not be uniform. Fourth, all of the data on lost security holders generated by transfer agents, broker-dealers, et al., should be sent to the SEC for a listing on one Internet web site. A majority of states already put their unclaimed property lists on the Internet, and NAUPA has a web site where it is pooling the various State lists. NAUPA, that is the State group, created the web site because the SEC had proposed in 1996 such a web site for itself, only to reverse itself after it had been lobbied hard by those who did not want the lost security owners found. Prominent among those were the so-called heir finders or locators, depending on who is describing them. The SEC already has the Thompson Financial Network operate the SEC's lost and stolen securities program under the name of Securities Information Center, SIC. If the SEC has a web site for its list of stolen or lost pieces of paper, why can it not have a web site for its lists of lost owners of the securities? Why should a piece of paper be treated better than the owners of the pieces of paper? It must be pointed out that the United States Government and the world Jewish community shamed the Swiss Bankers Association into publishing on an Internet site a list of unclaimed Holocaust era accounts which the Swiss Bankers Association had previously maintained had been lost or destroyed. I checked this web site from my office in Columbus for the name Klein, K-L-E-I-N, and I came up with three hits. That is from Columbus. There is no reason why the few big American banks which control the biggest transfer agents, and it is really a sideline for them, do not do what the Swiss show can easily be done, that is, put on the Internet the SEC list of lost security holders, which is what the States are already doing with their unclaimed property lists, and which the SEC actually proposed in 1996. Based on my experience over these last 11 years, I believe that there is sufficient interest in the private sector to distribute the information on the Internet at no cost to the SEC, once the information has been delivered electronically to the SEC. There is of course no reason to publish on the Internet the amount owed to lost security holders nor the quantity of securities owned by the lost security holder. All that is needed is the simple fact that John Q. Public is owed something by the XYZ corporation. I want at this moment to just quote from the Federal Register of October 7, 1997, from Page 52233 as follows. Now this is where the SEC reversed itself on having the same kind of an Internet site that a majority of the States have. ``Most commenters were opposed to the creation of a lost security holders database.'' I am sure they were because the people who didn't want the people to get their money would oppose it. ``Many commenters believe that the database would result in a loss of privacy for security holders.'' Well, the States have been doing this for 40 years or more, and how else would they know they were on the list if it weren't published somewhere? Continuing. ``Other commenters suggested that the data base would result in fraudulent claims.'' My observation on that is there are no such privacy or security problems because the States have been doing it for 40 years, and there are no such problems. And this is my favorite of all. ``Finally, some commenters opined--obviously a lawyer wrote that--that the database would be of limited utility because it would require that security holders take the initiative to discover whether they had unclaimed assets.'' Members of the committee, I have no idea what that means. I have read it a hundred times. That has to be one of the dumbest statements I have ever heard. It must mean that you might look yourself up on a list, but that is forever. Now, there is only one thing dumber than that statement, and that is the fact that the people of the SEC thought that it had some kind of relevance. It makes no sense to say that, and yet I think this is as good a clue of the problem that the investor has with what the SEC has done. Fifth, money due lost security holders as redefined here, which is held by any of the holders as redefined here, must hold that money in trust accounts, so that the security holder will get the interest earned by his or her dividends and interest instead of becoming a reward to those holding the undelivered dividends or interest. In other words, we have got to stop rewarding people for not doing their jobs and giving over the money to the owners. The case of Delaware v. New York is where New York and Delaware fought over approximately $1 billion in dividends and their underlying stock generated in street name accounts owned by lost security holders who used the major broker-dealers headquartered in New York City. Investors who leave their securities in street name with their broker-dealer can be as easily lost as any other name on any other list. Another important reason for requiring that the security holders' money be held in trust accounts can be gleaned from the $63.5 million in fines in addition to a return of $19.1 million illegally taken by Bankers Trust Corporation of New York in early 1994. This over $19 million was taken from unclaimed property due to lost customers of the bank, and it was illegally used to fraudulently increase the profits of the bank instead of sending that money to the States as required. There is a long list of cases that says when a corporation issues a dividend that dividend should be held in a constructive trust for the shareholder, so that when he shows up he not only gets his principal but he gets the interest earned by his principal. We have got to stop rewarding the person who keeps that money away from the shareholder, and the easy way to do that is follow this line of cases and say the interest follows the principal. Sixth, if a locator or finder, those other people I mentioned earlier, is engaged by any transfer agent to locate lost security holders at a cost to the lost security holders after the obligatory two database checks, those lost security holder accounts should be placed with locator or heir finders only on the basis of open bidding by locator/heir finders for batches of such accounts, each account in each batch to receive due diligence. In fact, the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators has urged the SEC to protect lost security holders from the excessive charges, that is, from 25 percent to 50 percent, of heir finders or locators. Again, the SEC never mentioned in its release how much these locators/heir finders charge. It took State Street Bank and Trust in a critique of the rule to expose this 25 percent to 50 percent charge. Seventh, the United States of America through its many arms and agencies holds great sums of money due others. The United States Money Return Commission should be created to locate all of this money owed to others. The U.S. Government should put the information on one Internet web site, and then the commission should simplify the method whereby any claimant can obtain his or her money wherever it may be in the United States Government. There is simply no reason for the U.S. Government not to use currently available technology to unite people with their money now held by the U.S. Government. The same principle applies to the securities industry. There is a list among the exhibits of the many different agencies which have web sites, but you have to seek them out, and they are all different. Not one State law is changed by any of these suggestions. These regulations only affect those who come within the clear jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission. NAUPA has encouraged the SEC to unite lost security holders with their money years before the money becomes unclaimed property due for delivery to the States. The elected State officials know that it is the intent of the State laws on unclaimed property to have their respective citizens get the money that is due them. It simply makes no sense to those elected State officials to force their lost security holder citizens into giving interest free loans to those who are holding money belonging to the lost security holders who are residents of their respective states. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity. [The prepared statement of Mr. Shamansky follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Robert Shamansky, a Former Representative in Congress From the State of Ohio Approximately 80 million people have invested their money in securities--both stocks and bonds--issued by businesses, which have made our market economy the most envied in the world. Those 80 million include--most likely--a majority of the members of this Committee as well as a majority of the other people in this room. In fact, for the first time in history, the American people have more money invested in securities and other financial items than they do in their homes. Businesses have a choice of raising money within one state, such as Ohio, in which case they would register with the Division of Securities of the Ohio Department of Commerce. However, if those businesses want to raise large sums of money across the entire country through our various stock exchanges, they must register with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These national markets regulated by the SEC have trillions of dollars invested through them. One of the main reasons why Americans have invested in the securities markets is because the securities and exchange legislation passed in the 1930's has assured them that they would be treated fairly by the securities markets, which come under Federal regulation. For example, cases such as Greater Iowa Corp. v. McLeldon, (CA Iowa 1967, 378F2d.783), are cited as holding that securities and exchange legislation has broad remedial purposes for the protection of the investing public and should be liberally construed. This Committee this day is performing one of the most important, but too often unappreciated of its functions, which is that of Investigation and Oversight. Without this function by the Congress, would we have had the reforms of the abuses uncovered at the Internal Revenue Service? It is quite clear that the answer to that question is a clear ``No!'' I became aware of some very unfair and indefensible practices by the securities industry the hard way. My aunt died in 1985, and I and a trust created by my late mother, my aunt's sister, were the beneficiaries of my aunt's estate. In the beginning of 1988, when I was gathering the Forms 1099 for the dividends from the stock I had inherited from my aunt, I discovered that I did not have a Form 1099 for the year 1987 for the most valuable stock I had inherited from her. When I contacted the transfer agent in New York, I was told that I had not been sent a Form 1099 for the year 1987, because I had not received any dividends in 1987! The reason I hadn't received any dividends was because dividend checks sent to me in 1986 had been returned to the transfer agent, because they could not be delivered to the address the transfer agent was using. When a check like that was returned, no further dividend checks were mailed thereafter. I asked why they had not looked me up in the phone book, because I had been at the same business address since 1966. They said they never look anybody up in the phone book. I had to look them up. I asked: ``What if I had been made ill by a stroke and could not look anyone up?'' They said I still had to look them up. I asked, ``What if I were dead?;'' and they said I still had to look them up! I asked, ``What if someone in your shop had been negligent in preparing my address?'' They said I still had to look them up. I pointed out that I was a lawyer and that they had just invented a new principle of American law, i.e., they were negligent; I suffered, because I did not receive my money nor the interest earned by my money; and they benefited from their negligence, because they were using my money as an interest-free loan, i.e., they would turn over my principal but not the money earned by my money. They said I still had to look them up. I then noted that they had accumulated over $500.00 of my dividends over a period of four quarters, and that over those four quarters or 1 year they could not find me. They agreed that they could not find me during that year. I then asked them how long it would have taken that bank/transfer agent to look me up if I had owed them the $500.00? I have yet to receive an answer to that question. (The answer is, of course, it would have taken them less than a minute at a cost of less than $1.00 to check me electronically on a database.) In August, 1992 I brought the subject of the unfair treatment of so-called ``lost securityholders'' to the attention of my Congressional classmate, now Senator Ron Wyden, who instantly grasped the significance of my disturbing experience. Ron, as Chairman of a Subcommittee of the Committee on Small Business, wrote to Richard C. Breeden, then Chairman of the SEC on August 20 and August 13, 1992. On February 22, 1993, SEC Chairman Breeden wrote Ron back in part as follows, ``* * * although the absolute value of undeliverable accounts, about $10 billion according to the Division's (Division of Market Regulation) estimate, is substantial, this is only about one-tenth of 1 percent of the approximate $10 trillion capitalization of U.S. equity and debt markets.'' Based on the enclosed exhibits and my direct experience with the Division of Market Regulation at the SEC, former Chairman Breeden's peremptory dismissal of the $10 billion dollars in undeliverable accounts is a fair characterization of the culture or attitude of the Division of Market Regulation and the SEC itself toward millions of securityholders who are owed billions of dollars of their own money! In its October 7, 1997 Release of the revised Rule 17Ad.17., the SEC said it had at first estimated that there were 250,000 lost securityholders, but that it later estimated that there were 3,000,000 lost securityholders owed possibly more than $450 million. It is only fair to point out that the SEC was off by a factor of twelve (12) between its first and last estimates of the number of lost securityholders. Among those experts in this field that I am familiar with, most believe that the most recent estimate of about $450 million is too low, also. Please understand that we are not talking about any money belonging to any government at any level, nor to any money belonging to any corporation. We are talking about uniting owners of securities with their dividends and interest rightfully earned by their securities for which they paid their hard-earned money. On July 28, 1993 the Sub-Committee staff presented to Chairman Wyden a report entitled: ``Return to Sender,'' tens of thousands of ``undeliverable'' dividend payments in limbo. Individual investors lose billions of dollars of shareholder assets because of lax transfer rules. Indifference by public companies and government regulators. A Pay Day for Public Companies and States? In addition to working with Senator Wyden and his staffs, I have been invited to speak before three annual meetings of the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators (NAUPA) and a national meeting of the Security Transfer Association (STA) on the subject of lost securityholders. Every state in the Union and the District of Columbia have unclaimed property laws, which require holders of other peoples' money to turn over to the respective states--after periods of from 3 to 7 years--the money being held. The states have been doing this for decades, and they have all used public records published originally in newspapers and at county and state fairs and that are now published by a majority of states on the Internet. These states have been doing this without either security or privacy problems. Likewise, corporations have procedures to check claimants for undelivered dividends and interest, and these procedures work very well. In other words, there are no privacy or security problems, except in the minds of those who do not want the lost security owners to obtain their own money. The advent of the computer and the Internet has completely changed the way securities and their owners can be kept track of. We are no longer in the days of ``3 x 5'' cards shuffled by hand. As a surgeon should be held liable for negligence today, if he operated to repair a bone fracture without first using a readily available x-ray machine, so should those who transfer securities today, if they refuse to use readily available databases, especially where that refusal benefits others than the owners of the securities. There are three very big credit rating companies which keep tab on almost every person in the United States who ever got credit or has made investments. When it comes to those who own stocks and bonds, their databases can find up to 80 percent or more of those sought, starting with either a name, an address, or a Social Security number, which is on, I believe, every driver's license issued in the United States as required by the Federal law. People who own stocks and bonds are not trying to hide from their own money. Almost without exception owners of stocks send in their Social Security numbers on a Form W-9 to transfer agents so that the transfer agents will not withhold twenty percent (20 percent) of the dividends for the IRS. People want to get their money, and the fifty states and the District of Columbia have demonstrated conclusively that there are no legal, ethical, or other policy considerations such as privacy or security, which prevent delivery to owners of securities the dividends and interest earned by their securities. It was my lot to bring to the attention of the SEC through Senator Wyden that the SEC was not assuring investors that they would have their dividends and interest delivered to them promptly--or at all--by the use of good addresses. Under the SEC's existing Regulation 17 CFR Part 240. Rule 17Ad-10. specifying ``Certificate detail,'' e.g., ``(4) the address of the registered securityholder,'' the SEC had and has the authority of providing for the following common sense, non-rocket science practices, which were suggested to it by me as an investor in correspondence and/ or during various meetings at the SEC: 1. Beside transfer agents, the regulations regarding lost securityholders should apply to broker-dealers, corporate trustees, personal and institutional custodians and mutual funds, and issuers which do their own transfer work, because transfer agents maintain records for only approximately one-half (1/2) of the securityholders in the United States. The SEC in 1996 proposed changes to include recordkeeping broker-dealers, but then reversed itself in 1997, saying that changes only applied to recordkeeping transfer agents. 2. Regulations, which apply to securityholders lost on or after December 8, 1997 should apply equally to all securityholders who had been lost before December 8, 1977. 3. The lost securityholder regulations should apply to securityholders who meet the $25.00 de minimis test adopted by the SEC in 1997, if their checks remain uncashed for 7 months. The next regularly-sent dividend and interest checks should inform the payee that a previously sent check had not been cashed, and the notice should request a call to a toll-free number or other communication. There is sound precedent from Prudential Insurance for notices like this, and I have conferred with one of the most prominent transfer agents that this can be easily done through their computers at insignificant cost. 4. All of the data on lost securityholders generated by transfer agents, broker/dealers et al., should be sent to the SEC for listing on one Internet website. A majority of states already put their unclaimed property lists on the Internet, and NAUPA has a website where it is pooling various state lists. NAUPA created the website, because the SEC proposed such a website for itself in a 1996 release, only to reverse itself after it had been lobbied hard by those who did not want the lost securityholders found. Prominent among those were ``heir finders'' or locators (or vampires) depending on who is describing them. The SEC already has the Thomson Financial Network operate the SEC's Lost and Stolen Securities Program under the name of Securities Information Center (SIC). If the SEC has a website for its list of lost or stolen pieces of paper, why can it not have a website for its list of the lost owners of securities? Why should a piece of paper be treated better than the owner of a piece of paper? It must be pointed out that the United States Government and the world Jewish community shamed the Swiss Bankers Association into publishing on an Internet website a list of unclaimed Holocaust era accounts, which the Swiss Bankers Association had previously maintained had been lost or destroyed. (I checked this website from my office in Columbus for the name ``Klein,'' and I came up with three hits!) There is no reason why the few big American banks, which control the biggest transfer agents, do not do what the Swiss show can easily be done, i.e., put on the Internet the SEC list of lost securityholders, which is what the states are already doing with their unclaimed property owners lists. Based on my experience over these last 11 years, I believe that there is sufficient interest in the private sector to distribute the information on the Internet at no cost to the SEC once the information has been delivered electronically to the SEC. There is, of course, no reason to publish on the Internet the amount owed the lost securityholders nor the quantity of securities owned by the lost securityholder. All that is needed is the simple fact that John Q. Public is owed something by XYZ Corporation. 5. Money due lost securityholders as redefined here, which is held by any of the holders as redefined here, must hold that money in trust accounts, so that the securityholder will get the interest earned by his or her dividends and interest instead of becoming a reward to those holding the undelivered dividends or interest. The case of Delaware v. New York, 507 U.S. 490, 113 S. Ct. 1550 (1992), is where New York and Delaware fought over the approximately $1 billion in dividends and their underlying stock generated in ``street name'' accounts owned by ``lost'' securityholders, who used the major broker-dealers headquartered in New York City. (Investors who leave their securities in ``street name'' with a broker-dealer can be as easily lost as any other name on any other list.) Another important reason for requiring that securityholders' money be held in trust accounts can be gleaned from the $63.5 million in fines in addition to the return of $19.1 million illegally taken by Bankers Trust Corporation of New York in early 1994. This $19.1 million was taken from unclaimed property due to lost customers of the bank, and it was illegally used to falsely increase the profits of the bank, instead of sending that money to the states as required. 6. If a locator/heir finder is engaged by any transfer agent, et al., to locate lost securityholders at a cost to the lost securityholder after the obligatory two database checks, those lost securityholder accounts should be placed with locator/heir finders only on the basis of open bidding by locator/heir finders for batches of such accounts, each account in each batch to receive due diligence. In fact the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators has urged the SEC to protect lost securityholders from the excessive charges (from 25 percent to 50 percent) of heir finders or locators. 7. The United States of America through its many arms and agencies holds great sums of money due others. The United States Money Return Commission should be created to locate all of this money owed to others; the U.S. government should put the information on one Internet website; and then the Commission should simplify the method whereby any claimant can obtain his or her money wherever it may be in the United States government. There is simply no reason for the U.S. government not to use currently available technology to unite people with their money now held by the U.S. government. The same principle applies to the securities industry. Not one state law is changed by any of the above. These regulations only affect those who come within the clear jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission. NAUPA has encouraged the SEC to unite lost securityholders with their money years before the money becomes ``unclaimed property'' due for delivery to the states. The elected state officials know that it is the intent of the state laws on unclaimed property to have their respective citizens get the money that is due them; it simply makes no sense to those elected state officials to force their lost securityholders citizens into giving interest free loans to those who are holding money belonging to the lost securityholders, who are residents of their respective states. Chairman Kasich. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized. STATEMENT OF THE HON. JOSEPH M. HOEFFEL, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA Mr. Hoeffel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to read part of my testimony that is marked ``Amended 10 a.m., 6/30/ 99.'' Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear before the committee to speak about corporate welfare and the need to reform the unending flow of taxpayer funds into corporate pocketbooks. As a matter of simple fairness, corporate interests must be required by Congress to share in budget discipline. We must no longer support programs and subsidies that waste our resources and tax dollars, hurt the environment and discourage and hinder competition in the private sector. It is time for Congress to acknowledge that Federal subsidies, including tax advantages, which may have been enacted for a valid purpose for a specific industry, can become obsolete, anticompetitive or no longer in the public interest, and it is unfair to require the U.S. Taxpayer to support such unnecessary spending or tax breaks that do not provide a substantial public benefit. Further, since no public body has systematically evaluated these Federal subsidies, it is time for Congress to create a commission to review such unfair corporate welfare payments and to advise Congress on reform or elimination of such payments. Now, Mr. Chairman, just because Congress hasn't reviewed the corporate welfare situation, it doesn't mean others have not reviewed, and I have with me a pile of reports, really a partial pile of studies, that many groups have made of corporate welfare. Many of these groups will be testifying later this afternoon. We have determined what the problem is. Not everybody agrees on specific matters that need to be changed, but there have been lots of studies about the evils of corporate welfare, but Congress has not yet figured out a way to deal with it. There are many examples of the problem, Mr. Chairman. The Center for Policy Attitudes released a poll saying only 19 percent of the respondents feel that government is run for the benefit of all the people, while 75 percent of the American people think government's run for the benefit of a few big interests. The Citizens Against Government Waste was highly critical of last year's budget bill, determining that that bill enacted 2,838 pork barrel projects, totalling $12 billion, into law. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed the 1998 budget and said it contained 79 new tax provisions, each of them benefiting fewer than 100 American taxpayers. Time magazine, which Ralph Nader referred to earlier, has concluded that the costs of corporate welfare are the equivalent of nearly 2 weekly paychecks from every working man and woman in this country, and they further estimated in that Time series that the Federal Government pays out annually $125 billion in corporate welfare, equivalent to the annual income tax paid by 60 million of our fellow taxpayers. Clearly, clearly we have to act. I am proposing that we pass into law the Corporate Welfare Reform Commission Act to establish a congressional advisory commission to examine and recommend to the Congress after careful review a list of Federally supported programs which have outlived their initial purposes or that fail to provide a substantial public benefit. We seem to know where we want to go on this issue. We have got all of these reports that we could ever possibly want to evaluate, but we don't know how to get there. We are missing a means to implement reform responsibly and quickly. My legislation will provide such a mechanism. The legislation would provide for the establishment of a five member independent nonpartisan commission with all of the membership appointed by Congress. The commission would identify unfair Federal subsidies to profit making industries, tax preferences and below market rate fees and recommend reform of those provisions to the Congress under a rigid timetable for reform or termination. Generally excluded from this review would be Federal programs primarily designed for public health and safety, for education and for the environment. The timetable suggested in my legislation would require the commission to submit to Congress no later than December 1st, 2000, a report containing the commission's findings and its recommendations. Congressional leaders shall promptly then introduce implementing legislation and the committees would have 120 calendar days from the day of referral to report the bills or the bills shall be discharged and promptly placed on the legislative calendars of both Houses. The debate shall be limited. Amendments would be in order during legislative deliberations. Mr. Chairman, legislation on corporate welfare reform was introduced in the lasting Congress and hearings were held. In this Congress, we are moving forward sooner, and I compliment the Chair for pushing this matter forward and showing the courage to do so. Perhaps by taking a slightly different angle on this we can speed up the process. We need to institutionalize our efforts and when conclusions are made by this proposed commission we need to have an expedited consideration by Congress to implement the decisions. My legislation would do that. I ask the committee and urge the committee to quickly adopt this process to begin to restore confidence in the Congress and its commitment to guarding the public purse. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Mr. Hoeffel follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Joseph M. Hoeffel, a Representative in Congress From the State of Pennsylvania Mr. Chairman, Mr. Spratt, I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the Committee to speak about Corporate Welfare and the need to reform the unending flow of taxpayer funds into the pockets of private corporate pocketbooks. As a matter of simple fairness, corporate interests must be required by Congress to share in the burden of budget discipline. Further, we must no longer support programs and subsidies that waste our resources and tax dollars, hurt the environment and discourage competition in the private sector. In a poll released on May 10th of this year by the Center for Policy Attitudes, only 19 percent of the respondents said that government is run for the benefit of ``all the people'' while 75 percent said that it is run for the benefit of `` a few big interests.'' The Congress is now in the midst of its annual appropriations work schedule. I can only hope that last year's experience has taught us a lesson. According to an analysis of the the 3,000 page Omnibus Appropriations Act and the five other Appropriations bills by the Citizens Against Government Waste, the Congress enacted into law 2,838 pork barrel projects totaling $12 billion dollars. It is small wonder that public skepticism abounds. Federal programs should not be turned into an accumulation of special interest provisions. Public support for programs depends on the belief that they are for the public good. If the trend in special interest provisions continues, public confidence in the work of the Congress will be further undermined. The Congress will be seen as returning to a policy of public spoils and not of shared sacrifice for the benefit of most Americans. In a month-long series of articles which covered the breadth of this problem late last year, Time magazine researchers concluded that the costs of Corporate Welfare were the equivalent of nearly two weekly paychecks from every working man and woman in America. This is truly staggering. It was further estimated in the same series of articles that the Federal Government has paid out $125 billion annually in corporate welfare, equivalent to all the income tax paid by 60 million individuals and families. Corporate Welfare is comprised of subsidy elements of Federal spending, Federal usage fees below market rates and special tax preferences that benefit commercial industries and corporations by providing a public benefit that is less than the cost of such program to the Federal taxpayer and providing an unfair competitive advantage or financial windfall. No effort to stanch the outflow flow of tax dollars can succeed without addressing each of these categories. Additionally, some review should be made of special interest subsidies and tax breaks inserted into the Federal budgets without adequate public notice or review. In fact, the 1998 Balanced Budget contained 79 new tax provisions, each benefiting fewer than 100 American taxpayers according to a Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation study. Private organizations with divergent points of view such as the Heritage Foundation, the Progressive Policy Institute, the Cato Institute, Common Cause, Citizens Against Government Waste as well as a coalition of Friends of the Earth, Taxpayers for Common Sense and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group have, in the past, published lists which identify Federal programs which waste tax payer monies. Additionally, organizations such as Ralph Nader's Public Citizen, National Taxpayers Union and American for Tax Reform have all participated in the past by endorsing attempts to plug this drain on the budget . This wide ranging interest is further demonstrated by the actions of both the Congressional Budget Office and the Library of Congress. In 1995, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) published a study of Federal Financial Support of Business. Also, in 1995, the Economics Division of the Library of Congress published its own list of Federal Programs that could financially benefit Business Enterprises. In 1997, CBO once again revisited this issue. Finally, the Administration's annual budget submission carries tables of ``tax expenditures'' as one of the several categories of programs which this Commission should examine as it moves toward the goal of lightening the burden on the American Taxpayer. I will introduce the Corporate Welfare Reform Commission Act of 1999, in the coming days that would establish a Congressional advisory commission to examine and recommend to the Congress, after careful review, a list of federally supported programs which have outlived their initial purposes or that exceed in tax support the benefits for the American people. In a word, we seem to know where we want to go on this issue, what we are missing is a means to implement reform responsibly and swiftly. My legislation provides such a mechanism. This legislation would provide for the establishment of: 1. A five member, independent nonpartisan Commission with all the membership appointed by the Congress. 2. The Commission would identify unfair Federal subsidies to profit making industries, tax preferences, and below market user fees and recommend reform of these provisions to the Congress under a rigid timetable for reform or termination. 3. Generally excluded from the review would be Federal programs primarily designed for public health and safety, education and the environment. The proposal is modeled after the successful Base Realignment and Closure Commission and is designed to remove politics from the subsidy review process. I have already taken action to make the Administration aware that this is a matter that requires a serious effort. On March 3, I wrote to Office of Management and Budget Director Jack Lew requesting that he provide me a list of government benefit programs that meet the criteria of Corporate Welfare Programs. In his reply to me, Director Lew identified 16 separate statutory proposals in the President's Budget to close corporate tax shelters, proposals relating to methods of business accounting that overstate expenses or understate receipts in an attempt to reduce taxes due and reductions in benefits through better management of users fees. On the spending side, Director Lew pointed to the Administration's efforts to reduce lender subsidies and recapturing part of the reserves of guarantee agencies. As one Member of Congress with limited resources compared with those of the Treasury Department, it is hard to thoroughly evaluate the merit of such a broad range of programs and tax expenditures. This Commission will have resources necessary to accomplish the goal. It also has the advantage of being a single focus effort not beset by competing daily requirements which would detract from a speedy, complete review necessary for successful completion of this work. Legislation on Corporate Welfare Reform was introduced in the last Congress. Hearings were held. This Congress we are moving forward earlier in the session. Perhaps, by taking a slightly different direction, we can speed up the process. We need to institutionalize our efforts and when conclusions are made by the Commission, we need to have expedited consideration by the Congress to implement these decisions. My legislation would do just that. I urge the Committee to expeditiously act to adopt this process including the timetable to begin to restore confidence in the Congress and its commitment to guarding the public purse, one of our most serious responsibilities. Chairman Kasich. I want to thank the panel. We have another panel that will follow this. I would like to concentrate my questions--and first of all, I want to pay a very high compliment to my friend, Mr. Shamansky, and it is pretty clear from this testimony, you have been about 11 years, Bob? Mr. Shamansky. Yeah. Chairman Kasich. Well, why can't we get something done about this? Mr. Shamansky. I think we are now with this hearing. We have made some progress. It is really an institutional problem of at all places the SEC, and I keep referring to the division of market regulation. It is simply amazing to me. I asked a person in a position to know what goes on over there, and I said why won't they do the job that clearly has to be done and the law expects them to do, and he looked me in the eye and he said, ``Bob, you are a single investor out in Columbus?'' And I said, yes. And he said, ``When they leave the division, are you going to give them a job?'' And the answer is obviously no. I don't know any other explanation. They are simply--it is a classic case of the regulator captured by the regulated, and in this particular case, I have yet to meet a CEO that doesn't want his shareholders to get the shareholders' dividend. They all want them to. You know John B. McCoy, and I know John B. McCoy. I am working with him to make sure that Bank One, and you know, clearly working with him on that, to make sure that the industry moves on, because all we are talking about is returning money to the--John wants his shareholders to get their money, and he wants his transfer agent to just use the technology and move on with it. The private sector will just apply the technology. The problem is, I think, institutional at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Chairman Kasich. Where do you think the proper point is up here for resolving this, Bob, and if we were to try to move to find somebody on a committee at jurisdiction, who could grab this thing and get this thing done, where would we go? Would that be the Banking Committee? Would it be the Commerce Committee? Mr. Shamansky. I would defer to your expertise on that, John. I don't know which one--I am sorry, I wish I were more knowledgeable on that. Clearly---- Chairman Kasich. Is Ron Wyden doing anything besides the report? Mr. Shamansky. As you know, legislative counsel is working on the different elements to present a bill and that really is to remind the SEC what its job is and the authority that it has. The only thing that they may need to be encouraged on is the idea of when dividends are declared and interest earned on bonds, say, just put it in trust accounts. None of this is rocket science. We are not taking--we are not bothering any State laws. There are no expenditures. It is just making sure that money is delivered to the rightful owners, and that is so simple. These people at the SEC can't handle that. Chairman Kasich. Or don't want to. Mr. Shamansky. Apparently. Chairman Kasich. Well, I think we need to make an effort. I mean, it is total--this seems to me like something that just should have been done in 11 days, not 11 years, and I think we have got to figure out how we can move all the various contacts we have to try to get this resolved. Mr. Shamansky. Mr. Chairman, this is based on my experience. This is truly a nonpartisan issue. I have yet to meet Democrat, Republican or anybody else who said a shareholder shouldn't get his dividend and a bondholder shouldn't get his interest. This is not what you are arguing. It is strengthening our market economy, and you do that by encouraging the individual to put his money in it. Chairman Kasich. Well, just an element of fairness, too. I mean, it is just simple common sense. Gentleman from Georgia. Mr. Chambliss. I don't have any questions. Chairman Kasich. Gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. Smith. No questions, Mr. Chairman. We have the testimony of everyone except Representative Hoeffel. Are you going to make that available? Chairman Kasich. We have his written testimony. Bob, what we need to do is just stay on top of this and see how we can get this resolved, and to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, I am obviously very interested in your legislation, would like to have a good look at it, and I can't imagine I wouldn't be helpful on that. To Mr. Minge, David, what have you found in your--what has your experience been so far in your efforts to try to reign some of this in? Mr. Minge. Well, I have worked in several different capacities. One is to meet with business and State officials that are involved in economic development and planning, and by and large I found the reception to be quite positive. In fact, the largest criticism that I have had or the most significant criticism is that my bill is not stern enough, that instead of essentially a 100 percent tax on any benefit, I use a lower tax rate or in the alternative they said why don't you just flat out prohibit this and have some agency that is responsible for the enforcement of this so that we don't have states using taxpayer money for subsidies to induce businesses to move from one State to another. When it comes to our colleagues here in Congress, there is some skittishness. There is a reluctance to jump into what they think is essentially a State and local issue. They feel if states and municipalities want to compete with each other and spend taxpayer dollars trying to woo each other's corporate headquarters, that is, you know, sort of like this is America, that is what we do, but on the other hand, as I have sat down and talked with colleagues about this, they have recognized that this is a very uncomfortable position that their State is often put in, and they would like to see something done. And what I am doing now is concentrating on finding cosponsors and starting to talk to the Ways and Means Committee ,which is the committee that would have jurisdiction over my bill, to see if they would consider having a hearing on it. Chairman Kasich. I want to thank all three of you, and I hope, Congressman Minge, that you will help me to assist Mr. Shamansky in being able to get an outcome. I mean I can promise you that he didn't do this because he had any self-interest, I can promise you that. He stumbled into something, and he went this isn't fair, and as a result, he has just been pursuing it, and we have actually worked with him for a while, but we need to get something resolved on this front. So I hope in a bipartisan way you will join with me, and we will make sure we can get this resolved for him. Mr. Minge. John, maybe this is something the three of us, now that we have heard it, we can cosponsor together. I think that he has a marvelous set of proposals and I compliment him. Chairman Kasich. It is kind of hard to believe, especially in the era of all the communication, the technology, it is just pretty amazing. Mr. Shamansky. If I may, Mr. Chairman, show in a sense a softie I am. I am a lawyer, as I have said repeatedly. That is why I spotted the word ``opine'' I think, but yesterday, I walked in front of the Supreme Court building, and it says ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' I want you to understand, I am affected by it. I actually believe that, and I was asked earlier, how could you and I be operating on this, and I said that is what this--but that is what this country is about. We are agreeing on the issue, and we are talking about fairness and justice, and it is equal, and that is all we are talking about, but it is what we are talking about. Chairman Kasich. That is exactly right. I want to pay you the highest compliment for coming today, and I hope we can somehow soon end this frustration. OK. We go to our final panel, which is going to be a very interesting panel. Grover Norquist, Americans for Tax Reform; Steve Moore, the CATO Institute; Robert McIntyre, Citizens for Tax Justice; Jill Lancelot, one of my favorites, Taxpayers for Common Sense; and Tom Schatz with the Citizens Against Government Waste. Is Jill still with us or did she leave? OK. I think we will start with the way they are listed on the sheet here. So, Grover, you get--oh, I am sorry, you are right. I will go to my favorite witness, Jill Lancelot, who will--are you prepared, Jill, to start? STATEMENTS OF JILL LANCELOT, LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR, TAXPAYERS FOR COMMON SENSE; THOMAS SCHATZ, PRESIDENT, CITIZENS AGAINST GOVERNMENT WASTE; ROBERT McINTYRE, DIRECTOR, CITIZENS FOR TAX JUSTICE; STEPHEN MOORE, DIRECTOR OF FISCAL POLICY STUDIES, CATO INSTITUTE; GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM STATEMENT OF JILL LANCELOT Ms. Lancelot. I am. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Jill Lancelot. I am cofounder and Legislative Director of Taxpayers for Common Sense, and certainly, Mr. Chairman, I would like to say thank you for giving us the opportunity to appear here today, but in particular I want to thank you for your leadership on this issue. In the interest of time, I think I will skip through where Taxpayers for Common Sense is unless you think that is necessary. It is in the testimony, and folks can see who we are, but I am obviously here to talk about Federal subsidies to business through direct Federal payments and tax breaks. It is a practice that we have all come to know as corporate welfare. Taxpayers for Common Sense believes the corporate welfare both drains the U.S. Treasury and misuses taxpayer money. The projected budget surplus that has been making headlines this week in no way obviates the need to reduce unnecessary and wasteful government spending. There is never a time to waste the hard earned money of taxpayer dollars. Instead, Congress should work to further bolster America's current economic strings by removing the drain of corporate welfare, a misguided spending priority that needs to end now. Not only is corporate welfare a misuse of taxpayer money, but it can have other ramifications as well. It can distort the market by maintaining industries that may not be able to compete on their own. Generally speaking, picking and choosing corporate winners is best left to the market. Corporate welfare also denies a fair return on taxpayer owned resources and properties. Corporate welfare continues programs long after they have achieved their intended purpose. Perhaps it may be impolitic to mention this, considering I am testifying before a house committee, but we do think that corporate welfare can sometimes encourage an unhealthy relationship between politicians and industry, each coming to depend on the other. I have chosen five examples that we deem corporate welfare, and I will summarize them quickly in the interest of time. The first four are also in the Green Scissors report and part of the Green Scissors campaign, and as noted earlier this morning, Ralph Nader has talked about some of these, but I think it is worth mentioning them again. Clearly, they are on many people's lists. The nuclear power industry provides a prime example of the government propping up an industry that the market was unwilling to support. In 1957, when no private insurance---- Chairman Kasich. Jill, excuse me 1 second. Is there a way you can summarize these five because we are going to be here all day if we don't do that. At least most of them have been here--Moore has been here for 3 hours. Ms. Lancelot. Well, as Mr. Nader said, Price Anderson prematurely pushed an industry into the market, and it has so far had about forty--there are many different estimates out there, $47 billion in subsidies to date, and the government, the Congress and Department of Energy have just funded two more unnecessary programs. The barge industry is a fine example where companies don't pay their fair share, which is an area we think is corporate welfare as well. The taxpayers built the waterway system, and the users don't pay for their operation and maintenance. We are talking about companies like Archer-Daniels-Midland, Cargill, Conagra or Dupont. We think that they can afford to contribute at least 50 percent to the operation and maintenance of the inland waterway system. As Mr. Nader and other Members of Congress mentioned, the 1872 mining law which governs the extraction of precious hard rock minerals on public lands, there is no royalty on these. The mining industry takes these precious metals for free. Even though the coal, oil and gas industries pay a royalty for the privilege of extracting those resources from public lands, the government has been forced to give away more than $240 billion of minerals under this law. This is, I think, a very good illustration of corporate welfare because it denies taxpayers a fair return on their assets. The Clean Coal Technology Program, another good example. Not only has this program failed to achieve its intended purpose, but it also benefits a wealthy industry that doesn't need its help. GAO says that it is a program fraught with waste and mismanagement. Those are the four corporate welfare programs that the Green Scissors campaign has also targeted. The defense contract mergers, which is what Mr. Nader talked about as well, although these are not in the spotlight right now because there is--none of them are taking place, the Pentagon can under current policy appropriate funds to reimburse defense contractors for expenses that are related to corporate mergers. The recipients of these funds include corporations such as General Electric, Northrop Grumman, Hughes Aircraft, and the decision to merge any of these related expenses should certainly be solely the responsibility of the companies involved. Taxpayer handouts should not fund these or any other many business decisions that private companies must make every day. In 1996 Congress passed legislation that ended public welfare as we knew it. Today we need similar legislation that calls for an end to taxpayer subsidized handouts to financially strong businesses and mature industries. That does end the formal part of my testimony, but I would like to make one other comment, if I may. The good news that I take from this hearing is that organizations that often disagree seem to find common ground on this issue. And I would like to applaud the chairman and enthusiastically support the suggestion that you made that we all sit down and come together and figure out one or two issues that we can all work on, and I just want to make--tell a quick story. This is the way to make something happen, where you have disparate groups coming together and members from both sides of the aisle coming together, focusing on one or two issues. It happened in 1983 before you--I sort of show my age here because it happened prior to the chairman coming to Congress--but the Clinch River Breeder reactor was a program that the government wanted to fund with a lot of money. I and others put together something called the Taxpayers Coalition Against Clinch River, and it had some of the people here on that maybe--some of the people here at the table actually the organizations hadn't started yet--but Citizens for Competitive Enterprise Institute, which was their first year, was involved along with business groups, religious groups, environmental groups, taxpayers groups. We formed this coalition and we killed the Clinch River Breeder reactor when it was going to be built in the State of Tennessee---- Chairman Kasich. That sounds like a holy alliance. Ms. Lancelot. In the State of Tennessee. We did this in 1983 when Howard Baker was majority leader of the Senate in whose State the Clinch River Breeder reactor was going to be built. In the House we had people like Vin Weber, a conservative from Minnesota; George Brown, Democrat liberal from California; and everybody in the middle; Claudine Schneider, moderate Republican from Rhode Island. In the Senate, we had Senator Bumpers, we all know Senator Bumpers from Arkansas that would be; and very conservative Republican from New Hampshire, Gordon Humphrey; and they stood up on the floor and they talked about the subsidies and the corporate welfare of this program and we beat it. So I applaud you. I support you. Let us do it. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Jill Lancelot follows:] Prepared Statement of Jill Lancelot, Legislative Director, Taxpayers for Common Sense Good afternoon. My name is Jill Lancelot, and I am Co-founder and Legislative Director of Taxpayers for Common Sense (TCS). Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to testify before the House Budget Committee's hearing on Corporate Welfare. I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman for your leadership on this issue. TCS is dedicated to cutting wasteful government spending and subsidies and keeping the budget balanced through research and citizen education. We are a politically independent organization that seeks to reach out to taxpayers of all political beliefs in working toward a government that costs less, makes more sense and inspires more trust. Taxpayers for Common Sense receives no government grants or contracts. Mr. Chairman, today I am here to speak about Federal subsidies to business through direct Federal payments as well as tax breaks. This practice has come to be known as ``corporate welfare.'' TCS believes that corporate welfare both drains the US Treasury and misuses taxpayer money. The projected budget surplus making headlines this week in no way obviates the need to reduce unnecessary and wasteful government spending. There is never a time to waste the hard-earned tax dollars of the American people. Instead, Congress should work to further bolster America's current economic strength by removing the drain of corporate welfare, a misguided spending priority that needs to end. Not only is corporate welfare a misuse of taxpayer money, but it can have other ramifications as well. It can distort the market by maintaining industries that may not be able to compete on their own. Generally speaking, picking and choosing corporate winners is best left to the market. Corporate welfare can also encourage an unhealthy relationship between politicians and industry with each coming to depend on favors from the other. All, of course, at the expense of the taxpayer. Let me expand on these points with several examples. Nuclear Insurance and Research The nuclear power industry provides a prime example of the government propping up an industry that the market is unwilling to support. Beginning after World War II with the Atoms for Peace program, America was determined to convert nuclear power into a productive rather than a destructive force. Then in 1957 the government released its first nuclear reactor safety study. This study concluded that a nuclear power accident could result in $7 billion of property damage and thousands of injuries. Recognizing the potential costs, a Vice President from GE told Congress that his company and others would not build nuclear power reactors unless they could be shielded from full liability in the event of such an accident. Since no private insurance companies would insure the reactors, Congress stepped in by passing the Price Anderson Act of 1957, a federally underwritten insurance scheme that paved the way for the construction of nuclear power reactors. Although originally enacted for only 10 years in an effort to jump- start the fledgling industry, it has been periodically extended and continues today to shield the nuclear industry from its full financial responsibility. Forty-two years ago the government defied signals from the private sector and prematurely pushed the nuclear power industry into the market place. And still, after $47 billion in subsidies and no reactor orders since 1974, the government continues to throw money at the industry to help it keep its head above water. Congress made history during the FY98 appropriations process when, for the first time since 1950, it did not give any direct money to the nuclear power industry. This was quickly reversed when Congress provided $19 million in FY99 for the Department of Energy's Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI). To date, the Senate-passed Energy and Water Appropriations bill for FY00 has provided $25 million for NERI and $5 million for the Nuclear Energy Plant Optimization program. These programs will examine reactor aging issues--work already being performed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Once again the government is subsidizing research for the mature commercial nuclear reactor industry by setting up brand new programs that are duplicative and unnecessary. The nuclear power industry generated $141 billion in 1996 revenues--surely it can afford to improve mature products without more taxpayer subsidies. Barge Subsidies Second, consider the barge industry. Federal programs perpetuate an uneven playing field by subsidizing financially flush corporations that have it well within their means to pay at least 50 percent of the costs associated with operating and maintaining the nation's inland waterways. The Congressional Budget Office has declared the barge industry the most heavily subsidized mode of transporting goods. It is estimated that Congress appropriates about $500 million annually for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of inland waterways. The O&M of this system requires, among other activities, the dredging of shipping channels and the rehabilitation and repair of locks and dams, costing taxpayers millions each year. TCS believes that, as major beneficiaries, the barge industry should contribute at least 50 percent to the overall costs of inland waterway O&M. Among the beneficiaries of this subsidy are a small group of 20 wealthy barge owners. These corporations include: American River Transport Co., a division of Archer- Daniels-Midland Co. (a company with sales in FY '97 of $13.9 billion) Cargo Carriers, Inc., a subsidiary of Cargill, Inc. (a company with sales in FY '97 of $67.7 billion) Peavey Barge Lines, a subsidiary of Conagra, Inc. (a company with sales in FY '97 of $24.0 billion) Consolidation Coal Co., a subsidiary of Dupont Nemours & Co. (a company with sales in FY '97 of $46.7 billion) Inland waterway operation and maintenance is a cost of doing business. Taxpayers paid to build the waterway system. At least let the users contribute to its maintenance. Hard Rock Mining The General Mining Law of 1872 is the granddaddy of all subsidies and is often at the top of many lists of outrageous give-aways. With good reason. The 1872 mining law governs the extraction of precious hard-rock minerals such as gold, silver, and platinum that are located on public lands belonging to the American people. First, under the law the mining industry is entitled to take free of any charge, gold and other precious minerals found on public lands. By comparison, oil and natural gas companies are charged a 12.5 percent royalty for extracting resources from public lands; for coal mined on the surface a royalty rate of 12.5 percent is paid and 8 percent for coal mined underground. Second, the law entitles large multinational corporations to take full title (called patenting) to mineral-rich lands for no more than $5.00 an acre. Through patenting or royalty-free mining the U.S. government has had to give away more than $245 billion of minerals. Clean Coal Technology Program Third, consider the Clean Coal Technology Program. Since 1985 at least $1.2 billion has been spent for this program. A 1991, General Accounting Office (GAO) report found a history of waste and mismanagement--a large number of projects had either been terminated within a few years of being funded, experienced substantial schedule delays, or exceeded their budgets. This mismanagement continues. Currently, there are seven projects that have been in the design phase for between 5 and 10 years and have yet to go to construction. Two of those projects are in bankruptcy. Other projects have been moved from site to site not finding any place suitable. The Department of Energy still has a $610 million commitment to these projects that are still in the ``design phase''. Furthermore, the program is duplicative because similar research is being funded by the coal industry and by states in coal producing regions in an effort to promote the coal industry. In 1996, the total value of domestic coal production exceeded $19 billion. This mature industry hardly needs a subsidy program, especially one that has serious questions regarding its effectiveness and productivity. The CCTP is a glaring example of the government's poor track record when it comes to selecting viable corporations. If left on its own, the CCTP most likely would not have survived the vagaries of the marketplace. However, as with so many corporate welfare programs, the subsidies allow an inefficient and impractical program to survive thanks to taxpayer dollars. Defense Contractor Merger Subsidies Corporate welfare involving defense mergers currently has fallen out of the spotlight as mergers have declined, but nevertheless could reappear at any time. Under existing policy, the Pentagon can spend appropriated funds to reimburse defense contractors for expenses related to corporate mergers. Called ``restructuring funds'' these handouts reward contractors for expenses for an activity that they presumably would have done anyway for sound business reasons. Recipients of the funds have included defense giants such as General Electric, Northrop Grumman, and Hughes Aircraft. Since the merger subsidy program began in 1993, these and other defense companies have billed over $817 million to the Pentagon. The decision to merge and any related expenses are solely the responsibility of the companies involved. Taxpayer handouts should not fund these or any of the other many business decisions that private companies must make every day. Conclusion In August 1996, anger at America's public welfare system culminated in the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, legislation that ended welfare as we knew it. Today we need similar legislation that calls for an end to taxpayer subsidized hand-outs to financially strong businesses and mature industries. Note: Attached is TCS's ten top corporate welfare items Ten Top Corporate Welfare Items 1. subsidies to the hard rock mining industry The 1872 Mining Law governs the extraction of precious hard-rock minerals such as gold, silver, and platinum that are located on public lands belonging to the American people. First, it entitles the industry to take free of any charge, gold and other precious minerals found on public lands. Second, the law entitles large multinational corporations to take full title to mineral-rich lands for no more than $5.00 an acre. Under 1872 mining law the government has had to give away more than $240 billion worth of minerals. 2. subsidies to the timber industry The U.S. Forest Service loses hundreds of millions of dollars selling trees from our National Forests to private timber companies. According to reports from the General Accounting Office (GAO) the Forest Service lost more than $2 billion from 1992 to 1997. One of the primary reasons for these huge losses is due to money-losing timber sales. More often than not, the Forest Service loses money when it sells National Forest trees because the agency charges timber companies far less than it costs to prepare and administer the sales. Furthermore, taxpayer dollars are spent on the construction of logging roads to assist timber companies in cutting and removing timber. The GAO reported that timber road construction cost American taxpayers $387 million from 1992-1997. 3. subsidies to the livestock industry Grazing on public land by privately-owned domestic livestock is subsidized by taxpayers because the fee charged is not enough to cover the costs of the program administered by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The program costs at least $5.76 per animal unit month (AUM) yet the current fee is only $1.35 per AUM. Recipients of grazing subsidies include major companies such as Union Oil, Getty Oil, Newmont Mining, and Anheuser Busch. 4. defense contractor merger subsidies Under existing policy, the Pentagon can spend appropriated funds to reimburse defense contractors for expenses related to corporate mergers. Recipients of the funds include corporations such as General Electric, Northrop Grumman, and Hughes Aircraft. 5. overseas private investment corporation The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) provides subsidized loans and insurance to corporations for overseas investment. The insurance covers expropriation, political violence and currency inconvertibility. OPIC also finances joint ventures in which foreign enterprises can own up to 75% of the project. Taxpayer money should not be used to encourage unstable overseas investment by multinational corporations who likely have the resources to find their own financing and insurance. 6. advanced technology program (atp) The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) was created in 1988 with the objective of ushering in new technological advancements by awarding support grants for research and development to various corporations and joint ventures. Though the program may have had a worthy objective, there is no proof that ATP subsidies are essential for encouraging investment in research and development. According to a March 1997 report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), almost half of ATP grant near-winners ``continued their research and development projects despite a lack of ATP funding''. Recipients of these funds have been General Electric, Xerox, Dupont, Caterpiller, and United Airlines. 7. market access program The Market Access Program (MAP), formerly known as the Market Promotion Program, is administered by the Foreign Services Department of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to encourage exports of agricultural projects. MAP funds consumer-related promotions of high- value products through trade shows, advertising campaigns, commodity analysis, information on foreign markets and training of foreign nationals. In the last 10 years, more than $1.5 billion of taxpayer money was authorized for MAP--funding promotions that benefit large trade organizations and cooperatives, such as Sunkist and Ocean Spray, who can easily afford their own advertising. 8. subsidies to the coal industry A. The Clean Coal Technology Program is a program with a history of waste and mismanagement. B. The Department of Energy's research and development program is an unnecessary program because it duplicates research conducted privately. The government has invested in programs that are ineffective and in which the market has shown no interest. 9. subsidies to the barge industry Each year, Congress appropriates approximately $500 million for the operation and maintenance of the 11,000-mile Federal inland waterway system. Operation and maintenance consists of, among other activities, the dredging of shipping channels and the rehabilitation and repair of locks and dams. Among the beneficiaries of this government service are a small group of 20 wealthy barge owners, including subsidiaries of Cargill, Inc. and Conagra, Inc. The barge industry should pay for at least 50% of the costs associated with inland waterway operation and maintenance. 10. subsidies to the nuclear industry In 1957, when no private insurance companies would insure nuclear reactors because of the magnitude of potential costs, the government stepped in by passing the Price Anderson Act. That legislation prematurely pushed the nuclear power industry into the market place. Forty-two years and 47 billion dollars later the U.S. government continues to subsidize the industry. Last year the Department of Energy created two new unnecessary and duplicative programs. Chairman Kasich. Tom. STATEMENT OF THOMAS SCHATZ Mr. Schatz. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I very much appreciate the opportunity to be speaking today on business subsidies and certainly appreciate your leadership in this area over the years, and all of us at this table have worked together on this, and we look forward to continuing to do that in the future. As you know from your attendance at our press conference earlier this month, each year Citizens Against Government Waste publishes Prime Cuts. This year the edition had 640 recommendations that would save taxpayers more than $147 billion in 1 year and $1.2 trillion over 5 years. Prime Cuts proves that there are plenty of answers to the question of how Congress can stay within the budget caps from the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. Among the most significant recommendations are the business subsidy items. Our top 10 list includes the Advanced Technology Program, the Clean Coal Technology Program, Dairy, Peanut and Sugar Subsidies, the Essential Air Service, the Export Enhancement Program, Market Access Program, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, Power Marketing Administrations, and the Rural Utilities Service. Time will not permit me to elaborate on all of these programs. They are all discussed in my formal statement, and therefore, I would like to focus briefly on the Advanced Technology Program. ATP was established in 1990 under President George Bush. It was supposed to promote the competitiveness of U.S. business by accelerating the development and commercialization of promising high risk technologies with substantial potential for enhancing U.S. economic growth. The intentions were noble, but the premise from which they were hatched was wrong. To agree with ATP's supposition, one would also have to agree that government funding creates wealth and that companies need government grants in order to innovate. Government does not create wealth. It takes our taxes, keeps some for itself for administrative purposes and sends it back to the public. It cannot judge the marketplace as well as the private sector. If Federal spending did create wealth, then surely West Virginia would be one of the wealthiest States in the Union, given the deluge of Federal spending the State has enjoyed in the past decade. However, West Virginia is currently the second poorest State. In regard to ATP, a 1996 General Accounting Office study found that 63 percent of the companies that applied for this funding from the Government didn't even bother to look elsewhere for money, and half of those rejected managed to find alternate sources of support. It is always easier to look for the handout than to do your own homework in the private sector and get money. And the money ATP provides is virtually nothing, about 1 percent compared to what the technology sector itself spends on research and development. According to the National Science Foundation, private industry spent more than $221 billion on R&D in 1998, up 7 percent after inflation from the year before, and all you have to do is look at the rush to get those Internet stocks out and the new tech stocks out on the market and on Wall Street, and you can see the money flowing in through venture capital. That is the way these advanced technologies should be funded. The companies are already doing this research. They will continue to do it without government assistance. They are also helped by the 20 percent R&D tax credit which is available to everyone, not just those companies selected by the Department of Commerce. Microsoft, of course, is a prime example of how R&D should work in the free market. Bill Gates didn't go to the government for a handout. He stuck it out in his garage, and today, this is obviously the most dynamic software company in the world and it was built through American ingenuity, not with the government's help. The company spends $3 billion a year on R&D. And here are some examples of what the Advanced Technology Program has been doing. Film technologies to replace paint on aircraft, a joint venture between 3M and United Airlines, and it would save about a $100,000 on a new Boeing 747. The companies that benefit from this new technology should be funding the research themselves. Application of gene therapy to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The National Institutes of Health currently spends $264 million on the Human Genome Research project. Now, that is where this money should be going, and as it turns out, it is our understanding, although we have not totally verified it, that the company that got this money went out of business at the end of last year. There is another one, ultra high density magnetic recording heads. Research money goes to a who's who of Fortune 500 companies: Digital Equipment, Eastman-Kodak, Hewlett-Packard, IBM. They will get the benefit of the increased market share from this technology. And finally, something called a suite of process monitoring and control technologies to cut costs and improve quality in the U.S. auto industry. This will clearly help only the U.S. auto industry, which now spends $17\\1/2\\ billion a year on R&D. Why should the taxpayers be paying more? Mr. Chairman, this list is only the beginning. This is the big pile of ATP grants, and a lot of them are fairly interesting, but all of them are really a waste of money because you are talking about a tiny percentage of the R&D, and you are talking about choices being made through a bureaucracy and not through the marketplace. I look forward to answering any questions on this or any of the other programs listed in our statement or even in the Prime Cuts, and I look forward to your continuing excellent work and your leadership in this area. [The prepared statement of Mr. Schatz follows:] Prepared Statement of Thomas A. Schatz, President, Citizens Against Government Waste Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today before the House Budget Committee. My name is Tom Schatz, and I represent the 600,000 members of the Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW). CAGW was created 15 years ago after the late Peter Grace presented to President Ronald Reagan the 2,478 findings and recommendations of the Grace Commission (formally known as the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control). These 2,478 recommendations provided a blueprint for a more efficient, effective, less wasteful, and smaller government. Since 1984, the implementation of Grace Commission and CAGW recommendations has helped save taxpayers $625 billion. Testifying before this committee is both an honor and a privilege. CAGW works tirelessly to educate the American public about wasteful government spending and the long-term implications of a bloated bureaucracy. Hearings such as this one will help CAGW in its mission to make government more accountable. Mr. Chairman, as you know by your attendance at our press conference earlier this month, each year CAGW publishes Prime Cuts, a comprehensive list of spending cut options available to Congress. The 1999 edition listed 640 recommendations that could save taxpayers more than $147 billion in 1 year and $1.2 trillion over 5 years. Prime Cuts proves that the problem in Washington is not the lack of ideas, but the lack of political courage to implement them. Among the most disturbing recommendations in Prime Cuts are the business subsidy items. In short, business subsidies, or corporate welfare as they are often called, are government spending programs that provide unique benefits or advantages to specific companies or industries. Corporate welfare includes subsides, grants, cut-rate insurance, low-interest loans and loan guarantees, trade restrictions, and other special privileges that confer benefits on targeted firms or industries. There are many programs that are classified as business subsidies. CAGW's top ten list is as follows: 1. The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) 2. The Clean Coal Technology Program 3. Dairy, Peanut and Sugar subsidies 4. The Essential Air Service 5. The Export Enhancement Program (EEP) 6. The Market Access Program (MAP) 7. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) 8. Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles 9. Power Marketing Administrations 10. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) The Clean Coal Technology Program was created in 1984 to assist private industry with developing commercial technologies that would use coal in environmentally sound ways. The General Accounting Office (GAO) has cited numerous demonstration projects that are experiencing difficulty in meeting cost, schedule, and performance goals. The Department of Energy has been more than generous to participating companies by extending project deadlines several times to allow their sponsors to restructure them. Even if the projects were to perform well, coal has very few remaining applications and is a dying substitute for other fossil fuels. The rationale for the Clean Coal Technology Program no longer exists, so the program should no longer exist. Based on a 60-year-old pricing scheme created to ensure an adequate supply of pure and wholesome milk, marketing orders inflate the prices of all products that contain milk. Milk marketing orders are regulations approved by dairy farmers in individual fluid milk markets that require dairy manufacturers to pay minimum monthly prices for milk purchases. The most illogical of all the provisions is the ``differential'' pricing scheme, which charges the manufacturers of fluid milk additional premiums, based in part on how far the manufacturing plants are from Eau Claire, Wisconsin. This makes about as much sense as the Federal Government requiring computers manufactured in Maine to be sold at a higher price than those manufactured in the Silicon Valley. The USDA milk marketing rule adopted in April 1999 merely reduces the number of regional milk marketing orders from 31 to 11 and the blatant disparity in the price differentials, but fails to enhance industry competitiveness. As a result of the 1996 Farm Bill, farmers now have the freedom to farm almost everything, except peanuts. Only farmers who own or lease a production quota can legally grow peanuts to be sold for edible use. With a government-guaranteed support price of $610 per ton (compared to a world price of $350 per ton), domestic prices are 74.3 percent higher than the average world market price. This imposes a hidden peanut tax of as much as $500 million annually on U.S. consumers. As taxpayers, consumers are hit again for millions of dollars that the Federal Government pays each year in inflated peanut prices for government feeding programs. The present sugar program consists of a domestic commodity loan program that sets a support price (loan rate) for sugar and establishes an import quota system that restricts foreign competition and ensures a high domestic price for sugar. When Congress reformed most agricultural programs in the 1996 Farm Bill, it left the sugar program virtually untouched. The sugar program costs consumers at least $1.2 billion in higher costs for sugar and sugar-containing products, and it costs taxpayers another $90 million in higher prices for sugar and sugar- containing products purchased for the Federal Government's feeding programs. A handful of wealthy sugar barons, who represent less than 1 percent of the nation's sugar growers, gobble up 58 percent of the program benefits. These are not small family farmers. In a recent year, 33 cane sugar growers obtained more than one million dollars each from this government boondoggle, and one grower alone received $65 million. The Export Enhancement Program (EEP) was established in 1985 to subsidize the export of agricultural commodities. EEP participants negotiate directly with buyers in a targeted country and then submit bids to USDA for cash bonuses. Wheat growers have been the primary beneficiaries of EEP, which has awarded nearly $7.2 billion in bonuses since its inception. Proponents claim that EEP is necessary because European wheat farmers are heavily subsidized, thereby creating an uneven playing field for U.S. wheat to be sold overseas. But this program is simply a handout to big corporations so they can dump wheat on the international market. The 1994 Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which pledged to reduce both the volume of subsidized exports of agricultural products and budgetary outlays on export subsides for those products, also reduces the need for this corporate welfare giveaway. The Market Access Program (MAP) is the Federal Government's attempt to help build foreign markets for multimillion dollar companies. In the past, this corporate handout has gone to multinational corporations such as Burger King, Dole, Purina, and Sunkist. Even though the 1996 Farm Bill placed tighter restrictions on MAP spending, this program still needs to be eliminated. No one has been able to determine whether MAP actually works, but even if it did, why should private citizens pay for it? The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) was created to provide subsidized direct loans, guarantees of private lending, export credit assistance, and political risk insurance to corporations. It tempts companies to invest in countries where their better sense tells them not to. The Federal Government should not be using tax dollars to subsidize such risky investments. Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established in the 1930's to provide remote areas of the country with access to electricity. There are currently four PMAs serving parts of 33 states. The electricity provided by PMAs is sold well below the actual cost of producing electricity; the Federal Government makes up the difference through subsidies. There are two ways that PMAs could be privatized: a transitional government corporation could prepare them for sale within a fixed time, or their assets could be sold to existing customers or on the open market. The Congressional Budget Office notes that Federal sales of power only reduce utility bills slightly and therefore privatization would initially raise rates for a small number of consumers. These increases would simply address a market distortion caused by subsidized electricity; they would not ``gouge'' the consumer. The national movement to deregulate the electric industry requires that PMAs be privatized in order to begin to even the playing field. The initial mission of Rural Utilities Service (RUS) (formerly known as the Rural Electrification Administration) was to assist the nation's rural areas with utility infrastructure development. This mission has been accomplished. RUS survives today to bring low-cost electricity to former remote locations - for example Aspen and Vail, Colo.; Hilton Head, S.C.; and Potomac, Md. Other beneficiaries of low- cost electricity include major telephone holding companies. An April 1997 GAO report stated that $8 billion, or 19 percent, of the RUS's outstanding principle on loans was owed by borrowers that were experiencing financial difficulties (read: they won't be paying the money back). RUS survives today in a new and unnecessary form. The electrification and telephone subsidies should be eliminated, especially to nonrural areas, and current borrowers should be encouraged to pay off their loans. While all of these are prime examples of business subsidies, I would like to focus my testimony today on one particular program, the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). ATP was established in 1990 under President George Bush. It was supposed to promote the competitiveness of U.S. business by accelerating the development and commercialization of promising high- risk technologies with substantial potential for enhancing U.S. economic growth. The intentions were noble, but the premise from which they were hatched was wrong. For one to agree with ATP's supposition, one would also have to agree that government funding creates wealth and that companies need government grants in order to innovate. Government does not create wealth. It is ludicrous to think that any entity that levies taxes and then distributes that money after skimming a portion for administrative purposes could create wealth better than an individual or company. It is not the government's money; it is the people's money that is being recycled back to them. Secondly, if Federal spending did create wealth, West Virginia would surely be one of the wealthiest states in the union based on the deluge of Federal spending that state has enjoyed in the past decade. However, West Virginia is currently the second poorest state. Government programs don't add to the pool of research and development funds; they actually take the place of private funds. A 1996 GAO study found that 63 percent of companies that applied for ATP grants didn't even bother to look elsewhere for funding. Yet half of those rejected for grants managed to find alternate sources of support. Further, the money ATP provides is virtually nothing compared to what the technology sector itself spends on research and development. According to the National Science Foundation, private industry spent more than $221 billion on R&D in 1998, up 7 percent after inflation from the year before. These companies are already doing the research, and will continue to do it without government assistance. They are also helped by the 20 percent R&D tax credit, which is available to all companies, not just those selected by the Department of Commerce (DOC). Handing out tax dollars to a chosen few companies is much more likely to result in the underwriting of poor investments than allowing the marketplace to make those decisions. One only need look at the initial public offerings of Internet company stocks and the rush to invest in new technologies to realize that, once again, the private sector is far ahead of the government. The Microsoft Corporation is a prime example of how research and development should work in the free market. It is one the most innovative companies in the history of America. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates started out with a vision and, through hard work and perseverance, built one of the most dynamic software companies in the world. Microsoft was built with American ingenuity, not a government handout. The company spends $3 billion a year on R&D. Corporate subsidies often go by the name of ``government investments'' or ``government-industry partnerships.'' These programs are disguised by techno-talk, as exhibited on the Department of Commerce's website, which devoted an entire page to rebutting CAGW's corporate welfare claim. The following grants provide insight into ATP: Film Technologies to Replace Paint on Aircraft: 3M and United Airlines jointly propose to develop environmentally sound film products to replace paint used on aircraft exteriors. This will help reduce drag on airlines and can reduce fuel consumption by up to 1 percent or more, saving $100,000 or more annually on a Boeing 747. It is safe to say that that companies who benefit from a new technology should pay for the research and development of that new product. Application of Gene Therapy to Treatment of Cardiovascular Diseases: Gene therapy is the identification and eventual manipulation of a cell to correct a genetic defect. The National Institute of Health's National Human Genome Research Institute is currently undertaking this research. With a budget of $264,892,000 for this project in fiscal year 1999, this research is moving forward without the aid of ATP. Ultra-High Density Magnetic Recording Heads: This research money goes to a Who's Who of Fortune 500 companies, including Digital Equipment Company, Eastman-Kodak, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM. All will get the benefit of an increased market share with the development of this new technology. A suite of process-monitoring and control technologies to cut costs and improve quality throughout the U.S. auto industry: The Department of Commerce openly admits that this technology will help the U.S. auto industry. This grant, highlighted in DOC's Prime Cuts rebuttal, is typical bureaucratic thinking that the government, not private industry, should be the leading force behind research and development. The auto industry currently spends $17.5 billion annually on R&D. Why should taxpayers pay for more? Mr. Chairman, this list is only the beginning. While time does not permit me to discuss all ATP grants, I would like to submit the list CAGW has obtained to date. With the approaching appropriations battle, Congress needs to cut government waste to stay within the budget caps. Members should shine a white-hot spotlight on business subsidies. Eliminating such items from the budget will end a cycle of dependence that some corporations have on the Federal Government. Five years ago, Congress took bold leadership in reforming welfare for the poor. It is now up to the Budget Committee and Congress to reform business subsidies. I congratulate you on your courageous leadership in this battle over the years, and hope your colleagues will join you. Thank you very much for this opportunity to testify. This concludes my testimony. I will be happy to answer any questions at this time. Chairman Kasich. Thank you, Mr. Schatz. Mr. McIntyre is next. STATEMENT OF ROBERT McINTYRE Mr. McIntyre. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Kasich. I would also thank you for your patience because I know you have been here for an extended period of time, and I also know you have a very extended testimony, and I would like to make sure that without objection all of that is included in the record, and the gentleman's recognized. Mr. McIntyre. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It seems like many hours ago when my former boss Ralph Nader said that this was the first hearing on corporate welfare ever. Well, this may be the longest hearing on corporate welfare ever, but alas, it's not the first. Over the 25 years that I have been hanging around this town doing this, working for Ralph for part of that time, I believe I have attended about 50 or 60 corporate welfare hearings--at the corporate welfare committees, also known as the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees. They have had thousands of such hearings, as best I can tell. I didn't go to them all. Chairman Kasich. As an assistant to Ralph Nader, if I was a teacher, you started off clearly with an ``A'' from Ralph Nader. Go ahead. Mr. McIntyre. As we all know, I suppose, the Federal Government provides lots of financial assistance to businesses, and as most people have discovered when they have looked, most of that is through the Internal Revenue Code. We calculate that almost $200 billion this fiscal year will be granted to businesses and their owners in the form of tax preferences. That is a lot of money. It is enough that we could cut taxes by about a sixth if these subsidies didn't exist or we could pay for more of all those government programs that the public likes. Either way, it seems that American taxpayers who don't benefit from these preferences--and among those taxpayers there are many American businesses--have a right to ask whether these tax preferences for business are serving the public good. Well, trained well by Ralph Nader, I have always been a free marketer. It always seemed to me that the private sector is really what drives most of what this country does in terms of the economic growth, and that generally they are pretty good at it. The government's very important role is to provide the legal structure, the education system, the highways, the basic scientific research and all the other things that government needs to do and needs to do well to make our economy and our society prosper. The problem with these corporate welfare items is that they muck up both sides of the equation. They make it hard for the government to do its job because they use up lots of government resources, and they make it hard for the private sector to do its job because they have the government telling private businesses what to invest in and what to do. Neither of those is a good strategy for long term growth or for a healthy American economy or for an economy that is fair. So my general view is I want you guys to do your job, I want you to have the resources to do it, and I want private business to do its job, and I don't want you guys telling them what to do. That is why over the years I have been a strong opponent of corporate welfare. Despite my eloquence over the years, many Members of Congress seem to think that putting tax entitlements into the Internal Revenue Code is really a terrific way to do business. Why? Well, one reason, perhaps the biggest of all, is that it has certain advantages if Congress decides to give away money. Let us say that you want to give General Motors a billion dollars. You could put it in a spending bill, ``General Motors gets a billion dollars for being a terrific American company that makes pretty good cars.'' But that shows up as spending, and then you have to raise taxes to do it, and that shows up as taxes, and so people are mad at you for subsidizing General Motors and they are mad at you for raising their taxes. But if you put the subsidy in the tax code, ``General Motors gets a billion dollars off on its taxes,'' that shows up in the budget as a tax cut overall and no spending overall. So you get to have your cake and eat it, too. So tax subsidies have an advantage over regular spending unfortunately, and that is one big reason why we have so many of them. By the way, I picked out General Motors not quite at random since in 1995 and 1996, despite making several billion dollars in profits, GM didn't pay any taxes. It didn't because in its wisdom Congress in 1993, with President Clinton's endorsement, that was the Democrats, augmented by Congress in 1997, with not too much Democratic support, so I guess that was the Republicans, decided to exempt General Motors' leasing operations from what had been some prohibitions against negative tax rates. As a result, GM's leasing operations zeroed out General Motors from tax, which is too bad. Now, of course, as the members of the Ways and Means Committee who were here before pointed out, all of these tax breaks are supposedly justified as incentives for valuable economic activity. Well, let me tell you something. Most of these things are pure waste, and that is the good news. When companies come into the Congress and ask for a subsidy for something, they are not coming in to ask you to tell them what to do. They are asking you to pay them for what they are doing anyway. That ought to be obvious. So you have to understand that when you are subsidizing these companies at their request, they are going to just do what they would have done anyway. That is the good news. The bad news is occasionally these subsidies actually work, and you really distort economic behavior. The classic example of that was in the early eighties when President Reagan, in his first incarnation before he became a born again tax reformer, decided that we should build empty office buildings all over the United States and pay companies to do it. We did and we got the empty office buildings, and the next thing we know, as the Bush Treasury pointed out, we had the S&L crisis. So, yeah, when Congress gets its finger really deep in telling businesses what to do it is not a good result. Now, I don't have any more time, but I do have some corporate welfare examples in my testimony. I point out that I just picked four that I thought were illustrative. We have a long report that is up on our web site that looks at all of the tax preferences in the code and offers a critique of them. Most of our comments are kind of negative. I encourage the committee to put a link to our report on its web site if you want to know what we really think. So thank you, Mr. Chairman. I really appreciate it. [The prepared statement of Mr. McIntyre follows:] Prepared Statement of Robert McIntyre, Director, Citizens for Tax Justice Thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the topic of ``unnecessary business subsidies,'' or as it is often popularly styled, ``corporate welfare.'' As is well known, the Federal Government provides financial assistance to businesses in a variety of ways and for a variety of stated purposes. The vast bulk of such assistance is provided through special tax abatements for businesses that engage in favored activities. As the Congressional Budget Office noted in 1995, ``The Federal Government's efforts to promote business are heavily weighted toward tax preferences, with spending and credit programs accounting for a smaller share of Federal efforts.''\\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Congressional Budget Office, Federal Financial Support of Business, Oct. 1995. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In fiscal 2000, the total cost of business tax preferences, including those that benefit business investors or subsidize business products, is estimated to be $195 billion\\2\\--far, far larger than direct-spending business subsidies. One can easily calculate that personal and corporate tax rates are about 20 percent higher than they'd need to be if these tax preferences for business and investment did not exist. Or alternatively, the government could provide far more public services than it currently does at the same statutory tax rates that are now imposed. Citizens and companies that do not benefit from these tax preferences have a right to ask whether they are serving the public good. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ In its 1995 analysis of business subsidies, CBO used a rather narrow definition of business tax preferences, leaving out many of those that benefit business investors or subsidize business products, notably, most capital gains breaks, some tax-exempt bonds, and the exemption for life-insurance inside buildup. Based on the most recent figures published by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the fiscal 2000 total of business tax preferences included on CBO's 1995 list is $80 billion. Adding the investment tax preferences that CBO did not include, the total in fiscal 2000 comes to $195 billion. Even this total is probably understated, particularly with regard to multinational corporation subsidies. Note that the total reported here includes an estimate for the cost of business meals and entertainment write-offs, which was excluded from the CBO list. Note also that tax breaks for retirement savings are excluded from the investment subsidies reported here. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- We have organized our society to leave most decisions about what to buy and what to make to the free-market decisions of millions of consumers and businesses. Both economic theory and experience teach us that this is generally a wise choice. Of course, it takes a robust legal and political system to make these private decisions possible. Government must provide the legal system, the public infrastructure and the educational system. It must set the rules for commerce, deal with areas where markets do not work well, such as environmental protection and consumer protection, and smooth out the rough edges of capitalism to make sure that those who do not succeed are not left too far behind. It takes substantial public resources to build such a well-functioning economic and social framework, and it behooves the government not to waste its resources on usurping the role of markets where they do well on their own. ``Corporate welfare'' is a prime example of where government can undermine its ability to do its own job while simultaneously interfering with the private sector's ability to do what it does best. Curbing such unwarranted interference should be high on the list of those who want a more efficient government and a strong private economy. In my testimony today, I do not propose to offer an exhaustive critique of all the business subsidies in the tax code. Instead, I want to discuss some general principles, and then focus on a few of the more notable tax-based business subsidies. For a more extensive analysis, I refer the committee to Citizens for Tax Justice's 1996 report, The Hidden Entitlements (from which portions of this testimony are adapted). [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7748.157 I. General Principles Today, there are few who would challenge the notion that tax abatements designed to accomplish some social or economic goal unrelated to equitable tax collection are a form of government subsidy. Both those who lobby for such tax preferences and those who enact them understand this truism. Indeed, these tax-based subsidy programs even have an official name: ``tax expenditures.'' As the Joint Committee on Taxation explains: Special income tax provisions are referred to as tax expenditures because they are considered to be analogous to direct outlay programs * * *. Tax expenditures are most similar to those direct spending programs which have no spending limits, and which are available as entitlements.\\3\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ Joint Committee on Taxation, Estimates of Federal Tax Expenditures for Fiscal Years 1996-2000, Sept. 1, 1995, p. 2. See also Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-344), sec. 3(a)(3). For instance, suppose the government wants to subsidize wages for low-income workers. It could try to accomplish this goal in various ways. One might be by regulation, to wit, by setting a minimum hourly wage that businesses are required to pay. Alternatively, the Department of Health and Human Services could provide direct wage subsidies to eligible workers. Or a wage subsidy could be administered by the Internal Revenue Service, either by reducing income taxes for low- income workers, including tax ``refunds'' for those who owe no income tax, or by offering tax credits to businesses that hire low-income people. In fact, the government follows all three approaches. First of all, of course, there is a minimum wage. Second, many low-income workers have their salaries supplemented by welfare, food stamps, unemployment compensation and so forth. And third, the tax code provides an ``earned-income tax credit'' to low- and moderate-income working families and tax credits to businesses that hire certain low-income workers. Most government spending through the tax code is not targeted toward low-income people, however. In fact, tax breaks tend to reward those with the most lobbying muscle in Washington. Organized corporate interests have been particularly successful in obtaining tax subsidies--so much so that corporate tax expenditures currently equal more than 40 percent of total corporate tax payments. Tax subsidies as entitlements: When the Joint Committee on Taxation describes tax expenditures as similar to entitlements, it means that most of them continue without further review once they are put into the tax code. In contrast, direct spending on defense, roads, environmental protection, and other non-entitlement programs must be approved every year, and it takes an appropriation bill passed by Congress and signed by the President to do so. If a such a ``discretionary'' program turns out to cost more than expected, it--or something else--must be scaled back in the annual budget. But if the price tag on a tax break goes up, it continues anyway--and the process of curbing it is much more difficult. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7748.158 The budget advantages that tax entitlements enjoy over most direct spending programs is illustrated in the budget just approved by Congress, which contemplates huge reductions in most areas of domestic discretionary spending as a share of the economy over the next decade. (See table.) In contrast, tax subsidies are expected to maintain, or even expand, their claim on the economy over the same period. Standards for evaluating business tax subsidies: Size alone would seem to mandate that any serious analysis of possible ways to improve government efficiency and curb waste must include business tax subsidies within its scope. Like other spending programs, tax subsidies ought to be evaluated on the following grounds: 1. Is the subsidy designed to serve an important public purpose? 2. Is the subsidy actually helping to achieve its goals? 3. Are the benefits, if any, from the subsidy commensurate with its cost? 4. Are the benefits of the subsidy fairly distributed, or are they disproportionately targeted to those who do not need or deserve government assistance? 5. Is the subsidy well-administered? Few if any business tax subsidies could pass these tests. Oversight issues: With regard to the fifth point, one might question whether the Internal Revenue Service is ever the appropriate agency to administer a government spending program. After all, the IRS's expertise is in tax collection, not construction or farming or business investment. Would we ask the Energy Department to administer the Social Security system on the side? Would we expect the Defense Department to do a good job running the food stamp program? Does anyone think the Labor Department should be in charge of securities regulation? To be sure, handing a program to the IRS to run has advantages. The bureaucratic overhead may be fairly low, since the IRS will inevitably devote most of its attention to its main mission of collecting taxes. But the price for that lack of attention may well be inefficiency in the administration of the program. In particular, hugely expensive business tax expenditures purportedly designed to encourage productive investment usually operate with little or no oversight as to whether they are actually achieving their goals. If a direct spending program is failing to achieve its goals, the agency in charge of the program will usually be held accountable. But no one thinks to blame the IRS if the tax-based programs it ``administers'' prove too costly or fail to work. Why do many lawmakers find tax subsidies attractive? Poor administration, lack of cost controls, and unhappy distributional results are ``features'' that are far too typical of tax-based subsidies. Yet despite these obvious drawbacks, many politicians, at both the Federal and state levels, find tax expenditures extremely attractive. One wonders: Do they think poorly administered programs are a good idea? Are they unconcerned about the impact of uncontrolled spending on the budget? Are they unconcerned about the adverse effects on taxpayer confidence in the tax system that tax-subsidy abuses can create? Or do they simply see tax subsidies as a way to exert power over society and the economy without having their efforts show up in the official spending budget? This last point may be the most important. Because of the way the government's budget books are kept, politicians can have their cake and eat it, too. A direct spending program shows up in the official budget as Federal outlays and the taxes that pay for the program as revenues. But if an equivalent tax expenditure program is enacted, paid for with taxes on people and/or companies not benefitted, the combination shows up in the aggregate budget numbers as a wash. Neither net taxes nor spending will appear to go up in the official budget. In recent years, this has made tax subsidies the tool of choice for many lawmakers. For example, in their 1994 ``Contract with America,'' GOP leaders in Congress talked a lot about cutting spending. But among the most significant specific expenditure changes they proposed in 1995 were more than $100 billion a year in increased tax-based spending programs. Ironically, these huge new tax entitlements--mostly targeted to large corporations and the wealthy--were designed to show up in the budget not as additional spending, but as tax cuts. Likewise, in recent years, many of President Clinton's program initiatives have been styled as tax cuts rather than spending. Ultimately, of course, tax entitlements are not free. As was noted earlier, if all current tax business and investment tax expenditures were suddenly repealed, for example, income tax rates could be reduced across the board by about a sixth. Such a radical step is unlikely, of course. But eliminating or scaling back even some of these kinds of tax entitlements could make a very significant difference in improving tax fairness and easing most people's tax burdens. Such steps would also be likely to improve economic growth to boot, by curbing wasteful tax- sheltering activities and thereby increasing productive market-driven investment. Most corporate tax subsidies are pure waste. If you think for a minute about how these subsidy programs came into being, then this is quite obvious. Businesses do not lobby the government to tell them what to do. They lobby for subsidies for doing what they already do, and would continue to do anyway. Thus, companies that buy lots of equipment want subsidies for buying equipment. Companies that do lots of research want subsidies for research. Companies with international operations want subsidies for operating internationally. And so forth. As the House Ways and Means Committee noted in its report on what became the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Proponents of massive tax benefits for depreciable property have theorized that these benefits would stimulate investment in such property, which in turn would pull the entire economy into more rapid growth. The committee perceives that nothing of this kind has happened.\\4\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ Ways and Means Committee Report on H.R. 3838, the Tax Reform Act of 1985 (which became the Tax Reform Act of 1986), pages 145-46. To say that most business subsidies pay companies for doing what they would do anyway does not mean, of course, that they have no effect at all. For one thing, their cost means that other taxpayers must pay higher taxes or get lower government services. For example, if the price of business subsidies is less government investment in education, we may all suffer the adverse consequences. Likewise, businesses that get lower subsidies than their competitors may find themselves unfairly disadvantaged in the marketplace. In addition, even though businesses may not always realize it, subsidies do tend to have at least marginal effects on behavior. But if one believes in free markets, rather than central planning, these tax- induced economic distortions usually tend to be detrimental rather than helpful. As the official report on the 1986 Tax Reform Act notes, in the loophole-ridden era from 1981 to 1985, * * * the output attainable from our capital resources was reduced because too much investment occurred in tax-favored sectors and too little investment occurred in sectors that were more productive but which were tax-disadvantaged.\\5\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ Joint Committee on Taxation, General Explanation of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (May 4, 1987), p. 98. In rarer cases, business subsidies can be so large that they cause large economic shifts. That was the case from 1981 to 1986 in the real estate industry, where lavish tax subsidies caused a huge wave of excess office construction around the country. As the Bush Treasury --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Department noted in a letter in August 1991: Neutral taxation promotes the efficient allocation of investment resources, while the ability to use numerous tax incentives available for real estate prior to the 1986 Act had the opposite effect, the result of which was substantial overbuilding, one of the primary causes of the savings and loan crisis. Thus, most business tax subsidies are at best pure waste, and even worse, can sometimes cause perverse economic effects. II. Four Examples of Corporate Welfare in the Tax Code Let us now turn to a few of the many notable examples of business subsidies in the tax code. I've picked four items to illustrate various ``features'' of business subsidies: Tax breaks that don't work (accelerated depreciation). Tax breaks with perverse results (multinational tax preferences). Tax breaks with little oversight (R&E credit). Tax breaks with virtually no justification at all (business meal deductions). I should emphasize that all of these share common defects with one another. 1. accelerated depreciation Accelerated depreciation rules allows businesses to write off their purchases of machinery, equipment and buildings for tax purposes faster than the assets actually wear out. Special tax breaks for business capital outlays entered the tax code in the sixties, and were enlarged in various ways thereafter. The process reached its apotheosis in the major expansion of depreciation write-offs included in President Reagan's 1981 tax cut act. With the 1981 act, the tax-shelter floodgates opened. By 1983, studies by Citizens for Tax Justice found that half of the largest and most profitable companies in the nation had paid no Federal income tax at all in at least one of the years the depreciation changes had been in effect. More than a quarter of the 250 well-known companies surveyed paid nothing at all over the entire 3-year period, despite $50 billion in pretax U.S. profits. General Electric, for example, reported $6.5 billion in pretax profits and $283 million in tax rebates. Boeing made $1.5 billion before tax and got $267 million in tax rebates. Dupont's pretax profits were $2.6 billion; after tax it made $132 million more. CTJ's findings were similar in 1984, 1985 and 1986. In response to public clamor, his own newfound misgivings and the disappointing economic results of the 1981 corporate tax incentives, President Reagan helped lead the fight for the loophole-closing Tax Reform Act of 1986. The 1986 act greatly scaled back depreciation and other tax breaks for business property. The changes curbed corporate tax avoidance opportunities and made taxpayers out of most of the former corporate non-payers. While companies paid more in taxes after 1986, however, business investment flourished. As former Reagan Treasury official, J. Gregory Ballentine, told Business Week: ``It's very difficult to find much relationship between [corporate tax breaks] and investment. In 1981 manufacturing had its largest tax cut ever and immediately went down the tubes. In 1986 they had their largest tax increase and went gangbusters [on investment].'' Despite its advances, the 1986 Tax Reform Act did not end corporate depreciation subsidies. Even today, businesses are allowed to write off the cost of their machinery and equipment considerably faster than it actually wears out--a subsidy estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation to cost $37 billion in fiscal 2000. Moreover, when equipment is purchased with borrowed money, the current tax system produces outright ``negative'' tax rates--making such investments more profitable after tax than before tax! As a result, corporate buying and selling of excess tax breaks through equipment ``leasing'' deals have remained widespread. Indeed, leasing tax shelters received a substantial boost from legislation enacted in 1993 and 1997. These acts substantially gutted the 1986 reforms that had curbed excess depreciation of debt-financed capital outlays (as in common with leasing). As is well-known to tax professionals, the combination of debt-financing and accelerated depreciation typically produces negative tax rates. To curb such tax shelters, the 1986 act set lower depreciation write-offs under the Alternative Minimum Tax. Unfortunately, the 1986 AMT depreciation reforms have been repealed. One can see examples of the sometime startling effects of the accelerated depreciation rules by a quick perusal of corporate annual reports. For example, in 1995, Eastman Kodak paid an effective Federal tax rate of only 17.3 percent--less than half the 35 percent statutory corporate tax rate--mainly because of $124 million in tax subsidies from accelerated depreciation. Accelerated depreciation was one of the key reasons why American Home Products paid only a 15.6 percent tax rate on its $4.2 billion in U.S. profits from 1992-94. Allied Signal got $51 million in accelerated depreciation tax breaks in 1995, helping it pay a tax rate of only 10.7 percent on its $3.4 billion in U.S. profits over the past 4 years. And General Motors received tax refunds totaling almost $1.4 billion dollars in 1995 and 1996, despite reported U.S. profits of $5.2 billion, apparently in large part due to depreciation tax breaks generated by its leasing activities. Economists also complain--rightfully--that accelerated depreciation often skews investment decisions away from what makes the most business sense and toward tax-sheltering activities. This can, for example, favor short-term, tax-motivated investments over long-term ones. With its huge cost, minimal direct value to most people and sad economic record, accelerated depreciation might seem to have little going for it. Yet several recent proposals would expand depreciation tax subsidies far beyond even their current levels. The GOP's 1995 ``Contract With America'' originally included a $30-billion-dollar a year super-accelerated depreciation plan promoted by Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich (R-Ohio) that would have let companies write off more than they actually spent buying new equipment. A conceptually similar increase in depreciation write-offs is a key feature of the ``flat tax'' proposed by Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.) and endorsed by presidential candidate Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr. and former Rep. Jack Kemp. Nevertheless, curbing or eliminating accelerated depreciation should be at the top of the list for those who really believe in attacking corporate welfare and curbing government waste. 2. tax breaks for multinational corporations Multinational corporations, whether American- or foreign-owned, are supposed to pay taxes on the profits they earn in the United States. In addition, American companies and individuals aren't supposed to gain tax advantages from moving their operations or investments to low-tax offshore ``tax havens.'' But our tax laws often fail miserably to achieve these goals. For example, IRS data show that foreign-owned corporations doing business here typically pay far less in U.S. income taxes than do purely American firms with comparable sales and assets.\\6\\ The same loopholes that foreign companies use are also utilized by U.S.-owned multinationals, and even provide incentives for American companies to move plants and jobs overseas. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\6\\ See U.S. General Accounting Office, Foreign- and U.S.- Controlled Corporations That Did Not Pay U.S. Income Taxes, 1989-95 (March 1999). According to GAO's analysis, the 15,363 large American companies studied paid an average of $8.1 million in Federal income taxes in 1995. In contrast, the 2,767 foreign-controlled corporations paid an average of only $4.2 million in Federal income taxes that year--only half what the U.S. companies paid. This was true even though the average amount of gross receipts reported by the foreign-controlled companies was actually slightly larger than the amount reported by the American firms. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The problems in our taxation of multinational companies stem mainly from the complicated, often unworkable approach we use to try to determine how much of a corporation's worldwide earnings relate to its U.S. activities, and therefore are subject to U.S. tax. In essence, the IRS must try to scrutinize every movement of goods and services between a multinational company's domestic and foreign operations, and then attempt to assure that a fair, ``arm's length'' ``transfer price'' was assigned (on paper) to each real or notional transaction. But companies have a huge incentive to pretend that their American operations pay too much or charge too little to their foreign operations for goods and services (for U.S. tax purposes only), thereby minimizing their U.S. taxable income. In other words, companies try to set their ``transfer prices'' to shift income away from the United States and shift deductible expenses into the United States. A 1992 Congressional Budget Office report found that ``[i]ncreasingly aggressive transfer pricing by * * * multinational corporations'' may be one source of the shortfall in corporate tax payments in recent years compared to what was predicted after the 1986 corporate tax reforms. Variants on the transfer-pricing problem--such as ill-advised ``source'' rules and statutory misallocations of certain kinds of expenses--expand the tax avoidance opportunities. Let's say a big American company has $10 billion in total sales--half in the U.S. and half in Germany--and $8 billion in total expenses--again half and half (in reality). With $1 billion in actual U.S. profits and a 35 percent tax rate, the company ought to pay $350 million in U.S. income taxes. But suppose that for U.S. tax purposes, the company is able to treat 5/8th of its expenses--or $5 billion--as U.S.-related. If you do the arithmetic, you'll see that leaves it with zero U.S. taxable profit. Although our tax system has rules to mitigate this kind of abuse, companies still have plenty of room to maneuver. Here's a real-world example: In its 1987 annual report to its stockholders, IBM said that a third of its worldwide profits were earned by its U.S. operations. But on its Federal tax return, IBM treated so much of its R&D expenses as U.S.-related that it reported almost no U.S. earnings--despite $25 billion in U.S. sales that year. As a result, IBM's Federal income taxes for 1987 were virtually wiped out. A few years ago, Intel Corp. won a case in the Tax Court letting it treat millions of dollars in profits from selling U.S.-made computer chips as Japanese income for U.S. tax purposes--and therefore exempt from U.S. tax--even though a tax treaty between the U.S. and Japan requires Japan to treat the profits as American--and therefore exempt from Japanese tax! As too often happens, the profits thus became ``nowhere income''--not taxable anywhere. The official list of tax expenditures in the international area-- totaling $13.5 billion in fiscal 2000--focuses on congressionally- enacted loopholes in the current ``transfer pricing'' approach. Thus, the list includes items such as indefinite ``deferral'' of tax on the profits of controlled foreign subsidiaries, misallocations of interest expenses, ``source'' rules that treat certain kinds of U.S. profits as foreign, and the Puerto Rican ``possessions tax credit.''\\7\\ This list understates the total tax subsidies to multinational companies, however, because it does not challenge the basic, flawed approach to taxing multinationals that we current use. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\7\\ The official tax expenditure list also includes a tax exemption for most income earned by Americans working abroad. Although this item is treated as a personal tax expenditure, multinational companies say that it primarily benefits them by allowing them to pay lower wages. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- To be sure, curbing the multinational tax breaks identified in the official list would be a good idea. But an even better approach would be to replace the current, complex ``transfer pricing'' rules with a much simpler formula approach that taxes international profits based on the share of a company's worldwide sales, assets and payroll in the United States, as Senator Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) has suggested. Exactly how much revenue could be gained by this kind of comprehensive international tax reform is unclear, but some estimates are on the order of $20-35 billion annually. Yet when proposals are made for even modest changes in the tax breaks for multinational corporations, Congress, in the face of overwhelming lobbying pressure from multinational companies, has resisted. President Clinton pledged major international tax reforms in his 1992 campaign, but Congress rejected even the rather timid changes he proposed in 1993. The President's 1997 budget proposed $6.3 billion in international tax reforms over the 1997-2002 period, but most of these were rejected as well. Likewise, when the Treasury Department discovered in late 1997 that it had itself inadvertently opened a major new multinational loophole by an ill-advised tax regulation and proposed to correct its mistake, Congress barred implementation of the correction (at least temporarily). The very idea that our tax laws favor multinational corporations, including foreign owned ones, over purely domestic U.S. businesses should upset all of us. 3. the research and experimentation tax credit The tax credit for research and experimentation was first enacted in 1981. It supplements the already extremely favorable tax treatment of research and development investments, which can be deducted immediately, rather than capitalized and deducted over time, as is the case with business investments in tangible capital assets. The stated purpose of the R&E credit is to encourage business research that would otherwise not be undertaken because other investment opportunities would be more profitable. One has to wonder why Congress thinks it is appropriate to interfere with marketplace decisions in this way. In any event, up until now, the distorting effects of the R&E credit have been fairly small. That's in part because, due to budget constraints, over its lifetime, the R&E credit has mainly subsidized research that was already planned or completed (that is, it has generally been extended for short periods, usually retroactively).\\8\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ Some companies that take advantage of the R&E credit admit the obvious: that they would do extensive R&E even without a subsidy. For example, Applied Materials, which is lobbying for an extension of the R&E credit, notes in a filing with the SEC: ``Applied Materials' long- term growth strategy requires continued development of new semiconductor manufacturing technology. The Company's significant investment in research, development and engineering (RD&E) has generally enabled it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong competition.'' The semiconductor maker reports $8 million in R&E tax credits in 1998. See ``Does high-tech research require a tax break? Multi-billion dollar firms get a tax break and almost nobody is complaining,'' by David Bowermaster, MSNBC, Mar. 12, 1999. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The R&E tax credit has been modified many times over the years, in part to try to restrict its application to real scientific research (rather than, say, development of an improved Chicken McNugget). Recently, the IRS proposed a regulation to implement congressional intent in this regard by requiring, among other things, documentation of scientific purpose and methods for ``research'' investments to qualify. The proposed regulation has caused a firestorm of complaints from the affected companies. Yet it is quite clear that when the government subsidizes basic scientific research (which the market arguably does neglect) through direct spending programs it explicitly requires a showing by prospective grantees that a real scientific approach and purpose will be utilized. Thus, lobbyists who argue for a looser standard for the R&E tax credit and who argue that the IRS has ``little understanding of the way technology companies work''\\9\\ are implicitly endorsing a common defect of tax-based subsidies: the lack of oversight by a qualified agency. We would not tolerate such a lack of oversight in the case of direct spending. Why are we so tolerant in the case of a tax- based subsidy? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\9\\ See BNA Daily Tax Report, Apr. 28, 1999, p. G-5. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Useful business research is undeniably a good thing. But so are many other business activities. Research is also highly profitable, especially in our technology-dominated world. There is no reason why Congress should try to encourage such investments (at the expense of alternative investments) when they are not otherwise profitable. 4. business meals and entertainment subsidies Under current law, spending on meals that bear a ``reasonable and proximate relationship to a trade or business'' and are ``conducive to a business discussion'' are both 50 percent deductible and excluded from the income of the recipients. There's no requirement that business actually be discussed, either before, during or after the meal. Likewise, entertainment outlays--for golf, hockey tickets, etc.--are 50 percent deductible if the taxpayer has more than a general expectation of deriving income or a specific trade or business benefit (other than goodwill) from the activity, or more liberally, if the entertainment is directly preceded or followed by a substantial and bona fide business discussion. Such a discussion does not have to occur on the same day as the entertainment, nor does it have to last as long. The problem is not merely that these rules are hopelessly open to abuse--although of course they are. The fundamental problem is that no matter what the technical rules, the deduction/exclusion for meals and entertainment is considered by almost every disinterested analyst as an abuse of good tax policy. Recognizing this fact, defenders of write- offs for business meals and entertainment generally do not focus on tax policy issues. Instead, they attempt to defend the $6.6 billion annual cost of these deductions as justifiable government subsidies to the restaurant, resort and entertainment industries. Now if one were to make a list of government spending priorities, a subsidy for business men and women's eating, drinking and entertainment would seem to be very near, if not at, the bottom of the list. (Perhaps subsidizing business people's purchases of jewelry or furs would rank even lower.) So how can we possibly justify higher taxes on the general public or reductions in important government services to fund such a peculiar entitlement program?\\10\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\10\\ Lobbyists for the business meals deduction have recently come up with a novel argument for actually expanding their subsidy. They maintain that if the government decides to increase the minimum wage for low-income workers, then it's only fair to do something for better- off business people, too. As the Washington Post (May 3, 1999, p. A2) reports, in connection with the proposed increase in the minimum wage, ``table-service restaurants want to increase the business meal tax deduction from 50 percent to 80 percent. That change * * * would affect eateries ranging from elegant Washington bistros to hotel and chain restaurants across the country, could cost $3 billion.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- III. Conclusion The notion that many of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code are really hidden spending programs is a well-known fact to the special interest groups that lobby for the loopholes. Indeed, these interests usually prefer to get their subsidies through the tax laws--not only because the benefits are disguised, but because once enacted, they typically remain in the law as permanent entitlements. At a time of intense, critical scrutiny on direct government programs, it's especially important to focus on the hundreds of billions of dollars in ``hidden entitlements'' buried in the tax code. Far too many of these tax subsidies amount to welfare for corporations and the rich. They often involve the government in what it usually does not do well--trying to make decisions for businesses, investors and consumers--and as a result, they harmfully distort private economic choices. Their huge cost crowds out funds for what the government ought to be doing better--building the roads, promoting education, stopping crime, protecting the environment and so forth. And they make our tax laws much too complex. In short, while not all ``tax expenditures'' are evil, many of them undermine tax fairness, impede economic growth and divert scarce tax dollars away from better uses. If we hope to ``reinvent government'' to make it more effective and less burdensome--in short, a better deal for ordinary American families--then scaling back wasteful and pernicious tax loopholes should be at the top of the agenda. Chairman Kasich. Thank you, Mr. McIntyre. Mr. Moore is recognized. STATEMENT OF STEPHEN MOORE Mr. Moore. Thank you, Chairman Kasich, and thank you for your heroic efforts over the last several years in shrinking the corporate welfare safety net. You have been a warrior on this issue with some of the others on this committee, and I want to commend you for the service you have done for taxpayers on this issue. I also want to applaud Mr. Nader for his astounding testimony. I believe what his testimony shows is that there is a bipartisan on this issue of cutting corporate welfare subsidies, and I look forward to working with him on this issue. In keeping with the truth in testimony requirements, let me say that neither I nor the CATO Institute receives a penny of government money nor do we want any of your money. Let me start by making just a couple of observations about the corporate welfare state and then give you some recommendations about how we might try to win on this issue. First, we have found in our studies at the CATO Institute that corporate welfare is an enormous and growing component of the Federal budget. Our latest study finds that there are about $75 billion in spending subsidies per year. They are distributed through about 125 different programs through eight cabinet departments. You would unfortunately be hard pressed these days to find a single Fortune 500 company that is not a recipient of at least one of these programs. Interestingly enough, about 90 percent of small businesses in America receive none of this money. So this is really a David v. Goliath issue where all of the money is going to Goliath. I believe that the problem is not tax loopholes, as the previous commenter said. I believe the problem is the spending programs. I don't think that corporate America is undertaxed. I think corporate America is overtaxed. I think corporate America is paying far too much taxes, $200 billion a year, and I think we would be much better off if we let corporations spend their own money rather than sending it to Washington and then distributing it back to them. By the way, just in the last year's budget, we found that corporate welfare was up 2 percent and if you look at President Clinton's budget, unfortunately he proposes about a 9 to 10 percent increase in corporate welfare spending programs. One other quick point on this is I know you are embroiled right now in a big controversy about whether we have to bust these supposedly tight spending caps. It seems absurd to me that we would be talking about busting spending caps when we have $75 billion, and almost all of this program, Chairman Kasich, is in the domestic discretionary component of the budget. Some of it is also in the defense budget. We should certainly be able to find a savings out of the defense and domestic spending areas so that we don't have to bust these spending caps. Second point, companies are double and triple dipping. Let me give you some examples. We found that General Electric in 1995 received 15 different corporate welfare grants to the tune of $20 million. We found that Rockwell received 39 corporate welfare grants to the tune of $25 million. We found Westinghouse dipped 14 times into the public trough to the tune of $26 million. These are all companies that had more than $500 million in profits in the year that we were handing them out, at least $20 million in grants. By the way, you were asking about what we could do to improve our ability to get rid of these programs. It is very hard to find out how much various companies are getting in these corporate welfare grants and we ought to have some type of procedure where companies are required if they are going to receive these grants to declare to Congress how much money they are getting from all of these different sources. A third point, corporate welfare cuts should offset pro growth tax cuts. We have to bring down the enormous tax burden in this country. Proponents of corporate welfare say these programs create jobs. They say these programs help industry. Now, I like to use the example of someone like my father who was in the export business for 40 years as a small businessman and you know how many times in his 40-year business life that he came to Washington? Zero. He never stepped foot in this town, as most small businessmen never do. Most small businessmen don't have corporate lobbyists to chase down these grants for them and it is only the powerful companies that get these kinds of money, and yet I think of someone like my father who paid a lot of taxes over his years as a businessman and he had to pay taxes so some of that money could be used to essentially subsidize his competitors. Interestingly enough, if you look at the kind of strategy that we are pursuing when we pursue corporate welfare subsidies, this is really the Japan and Europe model of industrial policy. I remember 5 or 6 years ago when we first started talking about this, people were applauding the Japanese model as the model we ought to be imitating. Clearly we want to do anything but imitate the Japan model. Finally, let me say that you were very interested in some kind of strategies that we could use to eliminate corporate welfare and I have come up with a few that I think that you will like. First, I think that we ought to look at a program where we have a corporate welfare commission, as the previous panel discussed. You know in the past I have been opposed to this because I thought Congress should be able to make these cuts themselves. Unfortunately, the last 5 years have proven Congress will not make these cuts themselves and I have come to the unfortunate conclusion that we probably do need a corporate welfare elimination commission model modelled on the Base Closing Commission and we ought to tell that commission to come up with at least $20 billion a year in savings. Second of all, let's eliminate double dipping. Let's basically say to General Electric and General Motors one per customer, one grant per customer and that is it. Third, time limits. As you know, Chairman Kasich, when we passed welfare reform back in 1996, I believe it was, we basically established a very sensible policy that said 2 years and then off. You can stay on the dole for 2 years but then we expect you to become self-sufficient. Why can't we do this with America's largest companies to say you can get these grants for 2 years but no more than 2 years. If welfare moms can do it, big business can too. Next, and I think this would be a very hard thing to resist, why don't we have a policy that says basically that any individual or any business that has an income over $1 million is not eligible for any government subsidy. I think that this would be something that would be hard for anybody on the left or the right to resist. So let me simply summarize by saying that I think cutting corporate welfare and getting business off the dole is pro fairness, is pro growth, and is pro business and will make our industry stronger, not weaker. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Moore follows:] Prepared Statement of Stephen Moore, Director of Fiscal Policy Studies, the Cato Institute Thank you Chairman Kasich for the opportunity to testify before the Budget Committee on the issue of corporate welfare in the Federal budget. You and a handful of other members on this Committee are among the few Members of Congress who have made a valiant effort to reduce Federal taxpayers subsidies to business. Before I begin my testimony, I will state for the record in accordance with the Truth in Testimony requirement that neither I, nor the Cato Institute, receive any government funding. I have divided my testimony on corporate welfare into 12 summary points: 6 observations of Congress and 6 recommendations regarding how Congress can reduce the size of the corporate welfare state. 1. The corporate welfare state in Washington is a large and growing component of the Federal budget. America's most costly welfare recipients today are Fortune 500 companies.\\1\\ In 1997 the Fortune 500 corporations recorded best-ever earnings of $325 billion, yet incredibly Uncle Sam doled out nearly $75 billion in taxpayer subsidies.\\2\\ These welfare payments come in every conceivable shape and size, including government grants, contracts, cut rate insurance, loans, and loan guarantees. There are roughly 125 such business subsidy programs in the Federal budget and they can be found in virtually every cabinet agency of the government--including the Defense Department. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Stephen Moore and Dean Stansel, ``Ending Corporate Welfare as We Know It,'' Cato Institute Policy Analysis, 1995. \\2\\ Fortune, April 27, 1998, p. 216. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our latest survey of the corporate welfare subsidy programs finds that, although congressional Republicans had pledged an attack against unwarranted business subsidies back in 1995, these programs have actually expanded by 10 percent on average over the past 4 years. The Table below shows the budgets for 60 of the most egregious examples of corporate welfare in 1998 and 1999.

Source: Budget of the U.S. Government, FY 2000. Clearly, whatever strategies we have tried to employ to curtail corporate welfare spending have not worked very successfully. New tactics to take on the corporate beneficiaries of Federal subsidies are unquestionably necessary. 2. Almost all of the most egregious subsidies are in the forms of Federal expenditures, not tax loopholes. If Congress is serious about weaning businesses from Federal subsidies, it should concentrate on eliminating the Departments of Commerce and Energy, the Export Import Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, farm subsidies, and OPIC. These spending programs not only cost taxpayers money directly, but also create an unhealthy corporate dependence on Federal subsidies. Yes, there are unfair provisions of the tax code that benefit some businesses and industries more than others. Congress should overhaul the entire income tax system to eliminate those unjustified tax breaks. 3. Many Fortune 500 companies are double and triple dippers. All but a small handful of America's most profitable corporations have participated in the hunt for Federal or state government subsidies. Most of these companies are double-, triple-, and quadruple-dipping. In 1996 General Electric Co. won 15 grants for $20.1 million. Rockwell International received 39 grants for $25.4 million. Westinghouse Electric Corp. received 14 grants for $26.1 million. Yet each of these companies had profits of at least half a billion dollars that year. 4. There are no time limits for corporate welfare benefits. In the mid-1990's Congress and the states--at the urging of the American people--enacted major reforms in social welfare programs. There are now time limits on welfare benefits. Work, training, or education is now typically required in exchange for benefits. The result: welfare rolls are down by 40 percent over the past 5 years and record levels of former-recipients now working and paying taxes, not collecting them. None of this reform ethic has taken root in the realm of corporate welfare. There is no plan in Congress or the White House to attack business subsidies. In fact, the business community has come to regard subsidy payments as de facto entitlements. There is no ``two years and off'' time limit when it comes to corporate hand-outs. 5. If all corporate welfare were eliminated, the savings would be large enough to entirely eliminate the capital gains tax or the death tax. Private industry recipients of corporate welfare typically boast of the jobs that they create with their Federal grant payments. It makes sense that if Congress gives General Electric a cash payment, they may use those dollars for socially useful purposes. But the real issue with corporate welfare is what are the opportunity costs associated with the $75 billion a year in corporate subsidies. The Table below shows a sample of the types of pro-growth tax reduction initiatives that Congress could afford to undertake without adding a penny to the Federal debt, if corporate welfare were entirely ended. We could cut the personal income tax, the corporate income tax, or the payroll tax. We could entirely abolish the capital gains tax or the death tax. We could help finance a flat tax at a rate of 20 percent for all Americans. Those in the business community who contend that corporate subsidies add to America's competitiveness and industrial might, must answer the following question: Do you really believe that these programs add more wealth, jobs, or venture financing for the American economy than would entirely eliminating the capital gains tax or adopting a low-rate flat tax that ends all punitive tax treatment of savings? Very few could honestly answer that question in the affirmative.

Corporate welfare corrupts the political process. A recent front page story in the Washington Post notes that Microsoft, which until recently had no Washington office, now spends tens of millions of dollars a year on lobbyists, p.r. firms, and lawyers to protect itself from Washington. These millions of dollars would clearly benefit consumers, taxpayers, and Microsoft shareholders if they were used to build better software, not on lobbying Congress. Yet, one result of the modern corporate welfare state is that industries must almost all have a ``presence'' in Washington. One perverse, but predictable outcome of a $100 billion-plus corporate welfare state is that industry begins to view Congress, rather than consumers, as their real customers. Firms begin to produce for government, not the market. Corporate welfare, notes Wall Street financier Theodore J. Forstmann, has led to the emergence of the ``statist businessman in America.''\\3\\ The statist businessman is ``a conservator, not a creator; a caretaker, not a risk taker; an argument against capitalism even though he is not a capitalist at all.''\\4\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ Theodore J. Forstmann, ``The Paradox of the Statist Businessman,'' Speech before the Cato Institute, February, 1995. \\4\\ ibid. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Again, the sugar program is illustrative. In 1995 the program was under assault. It appeared that the anti-corporate welfare forces, would finally win a high profile fight on behalf of taxpayers and consumers. On the day of the vote on the House floor, big sugar prevailed by just three votes. It turned that 4 Members of Congress who were original co-sponsors of the legislation to kill the sugar subsidies voted against their own bill! Big sugar had provided hundreds of thousands of dollars of campaign contributions, with about a ten to one ratio going to members who voted for the price supports versus those who voted against them. The Fanjul family, owners of several large sugar farms in the Florida Everglades, captures an estimated $60 million a year in artificial profits thanks to price supports and import quotas. The Fanjuls are fierce defenders of the sugar program and to protect the cash cow, since 1992 this one family has contributed more than $350,000 to political campaigns.\\5\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ Rich Lowry, ``The Undeserving Rich,'' National Review, December 31, 1994, pp. 21-22. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Myths of the Corporate Welfare State Despite the quite substantial costs of Federal business subsidies, the efforts of a wide ideological spectrum of organizations like PPI, Cato, the National Taxpayers Union, some environmental groups, and even the Nader organizations to stop corporate welfare has been largely unsuccessful. As I told a Wall Street Journal reporter not long ago: ``We fought a war against corporate welfare, and corporate welfare won.'' The failure can be explained by the fact that the proponents of these subsidies continue to perpetuate myths about the benefits of the government-industry partnership model. The following is a restatement and refutation of those prevalent myths of corporate welfare: 1. The Federal Government can pick industrial winners and losers. The function of private capital markets is to direct billions of dollars of capital to industries and firms that offer the highest potential rate of return. The capital markets, in effect, are in the business of selecting corporate winners and losers. Capitalists put at risk their own money. With trillions of dollars now invested every year by Americans, the U.S. now has the most efficient capital markets in the world. The underlying premise of Federal business subsidies is that the government can direct capital funds more effectively than can venture capitalists and private money managers. But decades of historical experience prove that government agencies have a much less successful track record than do private money managers of correctly selecting winners. Example: the average delinquency rate is almost three times higher for government loan programs (8 percent) than for commercial lenders (3 percent).\\6\\ The Small Business Administration delinquency rates reached over 20 percent in the 1980's; the Farmers Home Administration delinquency rate has approached 50 percent.\\7\\ The Federal Housing Administration's default rate is 8 percent versus a 3 percent industry-wide average for private mortgage insurers. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\6\\ U.S. General Accounting Office, ``Debt Collection: Information on the Amount of Debts Owed the Federal Government,'' December, 1985. \\7\\ David F. Linowes, Privatization: Toward More Effective Government, Report of the President's Commission on Privatization, (Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 1988), pp. 41-42. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Corporate welfare supposedly offers a positive long-term economic return for taxpayers. But the evidence shows that government ``investments'' have a low or negative rate of return. In the late 1960's the Federal Government spent nearly $1 billion on the Super Sonic Transport (SST), which experts in Washington expected would revolutionize air travel. Instead the plane went bankrupt and never flew a single passenger. In the late 1970's the Federal Government spent more than $2 billion of taxpayer money on the Synthetic Fuels Corporation--a public-private project that Department of Energy officials thought would provide new sources of energy for America in the 1980's. The SFC was closed down in the 1980's, having never produced a single kilowatt of electricity. 2. Corporate welfare promotes American competitiveness. Business subsidies, which are often said to be justified because they correct distortions in the marketplace, create huge market distortions of their own. The major effect of corporate subsidies is to divert credit and capital to politically well-connected firms at the expense of their less politically influential rivals. This is precisely what Japan has found during it economic collapse over the past 6 years. In Japan the myth of industrial policy as a competitiveness strategy has led to a 60 percent reduction in the value of Japanese stock market since 1991. Although it is said that corporate subsidies are necessary so that U.S. firms can compete with their subsidized rivals in other nations, more than 90 percent of American businesses manage to stay in business without ever receiving government grants, loan guarantees, insurance, or airplane seats on Commerce Secretary Bill Daley's trade missions around the globe. But they pay higher taxes, which lowers their competitiveness, to support those businesses that do. Agricultural price supports are a case in point. Farm programs are alleged to be critical to the survival of American farmers. The truth is that of the 400 classified farm commodities, about two dozen receive more than 90 percent of the assistance funds.\\8\\ Over 80 percent of the subsidies enrich farmers with a net worth of more than half a million dollars.\\9\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ Stephen Moore, Slashing the Deficit, The Heritage Foundation, Washington, D.C., 1990. \\9\\ For a critique of the Federal farm subsidies, see: Jim Bovard, The Farm Fiasco, 1991. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Given that there are more than 1 million small and large businesses in the U.S. today, the subsidies approach to prosperity is utterly futile. The only effective way to enhance the competitiveness and productivity of American industry is to create a level playing field, which minimizes government interference in the marketplace and substantially reduces tax rates and regulatory burdens. All of the Federal Government's efforts to promote the big three U.S. automobile companies are inconsequential compared with the regulatory burden on that industry, which now adds an estimated $3,000 to the cost of a new car.\\10\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ Stephen Moore, Government: America's #1 Growth Industry, (Lewisville, Texas: Institute for Policy Innovation, 1995), p. 92. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. Government and industry partnerships should be encouraged. Government and politics are, alas, inseparable. Much of what passes today as benign industrial policy is little more than a political payoff to favored industries or businesses. Taxpayer dollars that subsidize private firms are routinely rerouted to Washington in the form of political contributions and lobbying activities to secure even more tax dollars. Cash-in; cash-out. For example, the outdated Rural Utility Services survives primarily because of the lobbying efforts of the National Rural Electrical Cooperative Association in America. With a $78 million budget, that association is one of the most influential and heavily financed lobbying groups in Washington.\\11\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\11\\ Associations Yellow Book, Winter 1994, Vol. 3, No. 2, (New York: Monitor Leadership Directories, Inc., 1994), p. 692. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the 1992 presidential campaign Vice President Dan Quayle traveled to Michigan to announce a $250 million plan to upgrade the M-1 tank--which happens to be built by General Dynamics in Sterling Heights, Michigan.\\12\\ Before the campaign the Bush administration had argued convincingly that in the post-Cold War era the more expensive tank was unnecessary. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\12\\ Jeffrey Gerlach, ``Politics and the National Defense: The 1993 Defense Bill,'' Cato Institute, Foreign Policy Briefing No. 22, January 20, 1993, p. 5. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Many of the top recipients of technology research grants awarded by the Clinton administration were also substantial contributors to the Clinton-Gore campaign or the Democratic National Committee. For example, Table 3 lists ten Fortune 500 firms that were multi-million dollar award winners of the Advanced Technology Program or the Technology Reinvestment Project in 1994 that were also large Democrat and Republican campaign contributors, according to FEC data compiled by Common Cause. (Almost all firms that chase corporate welfare dollars hedge their bets by giving to both parties. In Washington, the way to gain a ``seat at the table'' is to contribute bipartisanly. Industry learns the rules of engagement in Washington quickly: giving to both parties is tolerated; giving to neither is not.) In sum, corporate welfare programs often put our government programs up to sale to the highest bidder.

One of the main effects of many corporate subsidy programs is to raise prices to consumers. Trade restrictions, often sought by politically powerful industries, are estimated to cost consumers $80 billion a year.\\13\\ The sugar program alone is estimated to cost consumers more than $3 billion a year, according to a U.S. Department of Commerce study.\\14\\ The Commerce study concluded, ``Because sugar is an ingredient in many food items, the effect of the sugar program is similar to a regressive sales tax, which hits lower-income families harder than upper-income families.''\\15\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\13\\ James Bovard, Fair Trade Fraud, (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1991), p. 5. \\14\\ U.S. Department of Commerce, United States Sugar Policy--An Analysis, 1988, p. v. \\15\\ Ibid., p. 10. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Commerce Department's ATP program is also advertized as a job saver.

But in 1998 Congress resurrected the Wool and Mohair subsidy and the new version is just as absurd as the old. Incredibly, between 1995 and 1998, with the most conservative Congress in half a century, corporate welfare programs did not shrink, they grew. There is plenty of blame to go around for this policy failure. The retreat has been bipartisan. And the left and the right share in the hypocrisy on the issue, the left for claiming that it cares for the ``little guy'' while funding the biggest bully on the block, and the right for claiming it believes in free enterprise-- except when it comes to subsidizing corporate constituents. But the Republican retreat on corporate welfare is more perplexing and laden with hypocrisy than the Democrat's. After all, the GOP is the party that describes itself as anti-big government. It is precisely the Republican's skittishness when it comes to pushing big business off of the dole that gives their budget plans so little credibility with the public. Liberals charge that Republicans want to cut school children off the dole, but not the Fortune 500. The Washington Post assessed the budget plans by the Republican majorities by declaring, ``Everything seems to get cut--but not corporate welfare.'' Such attacks are devastating to Republican credibility. Why? Because they ring true. ``If you can't push AT&T and GE off the dole,'' Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper asked a group of Senate Republicans in 1997, ``how can we ever expect to get farmers, unions, artists, and seniors to give up their subsidies?'' Exactly. By funding corporations with tax dollars the GOP only has reinforced the public's suspicion that this is the party of the rich, the privileged, and the well-connected. The discredited mercantilist policies of the Commerce and Agriculture Departments are the antithesis of the free market policies Republicans say they espouse. When I once asked Newt Gingrich why the 105th Congress had not made a serious attempt to slice out corporate pork, he responded: ``This really isn't one of our top priorities....And I don't like the term corporate welfare much anyway.'' You can lead an elephant to water, but you can't make him drink. Corporate subsidies should not be last on the GOP's hit list: they should be first. Americans want government downsizing if it is fair and balanced--meaning that the budget knife does not spare the most politically well connected. The Republican budget revolution will continue to fizzle as long as GOP leaders ignore the corrosive impact that corporate subsidies have on the party and the government. What seems clear from the policy failures of the past 5 years is that the corporate welfare empire in Washington cannot be toppled until the left and the right forge an alliance to purge the budget of corporate largesse. Rep. John Kasich has heroically attempted to do so in the past with his ``Stop Corporate Welfare Coalition.'' Only a handful of Republicans and Democrats would publicly enjoin the Kasich crusade, the rest went into hiding in the bushes like the terrified Muchkins in the Wizzard of Oz. Despite the conventional orthodoxy in Washington that the United States needs to forge closer alliances between business and politics-- so called government-industry partnerships--the truth is that both government and the marketplace would work better if they kept a healthy distance apart. It's in no one's best interest for the regulators and the regulated to get too chummy. In Washington there seems to be a mighty fine line between too big to fail and too big to succeed. At the very moment that the Federal Government is in litigation with Microsoft, perhaps America's most innovative and profitable high-technology corporation in decades, Congress is spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to prop up the firm's less efficient computer industry rivals. If the government succeeds in its quest to knock Microsoft from its lofty perch, no doubt it will have a taxpayer funded safety net waiting to cushion its fall. We now have an unhealthy policy regime in Washington through which Federal regulatory and anti-trust policies are increasingly geared toward punishing success, while Federal corporate welfare policies increasingly reward the losers. 5. Corporate welfare fosters an incestuous relationship between business and government. Government and politics are inseparable. Much of what passes today as benign industrial policy is little more than a political payoff to favored industries or businesses. Taxpayer dollars that are used to subsidize private firms are routinely returned to Washington in the form of political contributions and lobbying activities to secure even more tax dollars. For example, the outdated Rural Electrification Administration survives primarily because of the lobbying efforts of the National Rural Electrical Cooperative Association in America. With a $78 million budget, that association is one of the most influential and heavily financed lobbying groups in Washington.\\17\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\17\\ Associations Yellow Book, Winter 1994, Vol. 3, No. 2, (New York: Monitor Leadership Directories, Inc., 1994), p. 692. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6. the ATP and other Commerce Department corporate welfare programs put government up for sale to the highest bidder. In the world of corporate welfare, big is beautiful. A preponderance of the high technology subsidies are diverted to many of America's largest companies, those with K Street lobbyists that help chase down ``free'' Federal dollars. For example, in 1995 the Philadelphia Inquirer monitored the largest beneficiaries of government technology subsidies from 1990 to 1994. Eight of the largest recipients alone had 1994 profits of just below $25 billion. (Table 3 shows the lucky winners.) Can anyone reasonably argue that at a time when the United States government is running $100 to $200 billion annual budget deficits, there is either equity or economy in having Uncle Sam sending out checks to billionaire companies? Can anyone argue that these companies cannot fund vital R&D projects and product development strategies without the help of Uncle Sam?

But what is even more insidious is that Commerce Department corporate welfare grants appear to be closely tied to campaign donations. Table 4 lists 13 large ATP award winners with the contributions made to the two parties--the DNC and the RNC. ATP appears to be little more than a cash-in, cash-out system. The best way to end this symbiotic relationship between industry and government is to shut down the cash dispensing programs that invite corruption. TABLE 4.--CASH-IN, CASH-OUT?

Mr. Chairman, I do not come to this issue with the intention of denigrating the contributions of these great and successful corporations. And I do not come to the issue with an anti-business, or anti-big business motivation. To the contrary. I want to see U.S. companies like MCI And General Motors dominating in global markets. The good news is that American firms are out-competing their foreign competitors today in industries across the board--from microchips to potato chips. Mostly these U.S. firms are winning without the help of government ``aid.'' It is not pro-business for government to try to help businesses one at a time--as seems to be the overriding mission of the Department of Commerce. It is not free enterprise for the government to be picking winners and losers in high technology markets--or in any industry. The way that the United States Senate can help create more Microsofts, more Intels, more Federal Express's, and more MCI's is not to have government go searching for them. It is to cut taxes, cut government spending, and streamline anti-business regulations that cause more problems than they solve. A good way to start this crusade to keep American industry competitive is to abolish the ATP and the MEP and the rest of the corporate welfare state that impedes the free market from functioning. Last year I co-authored a Cato Institute report entitled ``Ending Corporate Welfare as We Know It,'' in which we estimated that the Federal Government now spends roughly $75 billion each year on more than 125 programs that provide direct taxpayer assistance to American businesses. This dollar estimate has been generally substantiated by the General Accounting Office and other research organizations, such as the Progressive Policy Institute. To put the cost of these industry subsidies in perspective, if all Federal assistance to business were purged from the budget, the budget deficit could be cut in half. Alternatively, if Congress were to eliminate all these corporate spending subsidies, this would generate enough savings to entirely eliminate the capital gains tax and the Federal estate tax. Reducing the deficit or eliminating these anti- growth taxes would do far more to benefit American industry and U.S. global competitiveness than asking Congress to selectively pick industrial winners and losers. Just what is corporate welfare? To some, it is like pornography: they can't define it, but they know it when they see it. Here is the definition that I have used in my work on this subject: corporate welfare is the use of government authority to confer special benefits to specific firms or industries where there is no corresponding societal benefit. Last year Chairman Kasich and the rest of the Republican leadership in Congress pledged to ``attack corporate welfare'' as part of the quest for a 7-year balanced budget plan. The Clinton administration also seemed eager to terminate unwarranted government handouts to business. The administration even challenged the GOP Congress to identify and eliminate ``aid to dependent corporations.'' What progress have Congress and the Clinton administration made in cutting back corporate welfare in the budget? The attached table shows a list of 25 of the most egregious examples of corporate welfare in the budget. These are programs that critics on the left and right have identified as unwarranted give-aways to business. Out of $16.4 billion in corporate subsidies through these 30 programs, Congress cut spending by just $2.6 billion in 1996. This was a 16 percent cut from the 1995 level. Eighty-four percent of the corporate welfare survived. Congress did eliminate or substantially eliminate the following corporate welfare programs: the Travel and Tourism Administration; the Department of Commerce Advanced Technology Program; the Pentagon's Technology Reinvestment Project; Sematech; the Bureau of Mines; highway demonstration projects; and the Pennsylvania Development Corporation. Conversely, some very expensive corporate subsidy programs were reduced minimally, or not at all. These programs include: agriculture research service; the International Trade Administration; the Federal Housing Administration; fossil energy R & D; the Bureau of Reclamation; the Office of Commercial Space Administration; the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC); and the Export Import Bank. Spending was actually increased for the Agriculture Marketing Promotion Program, which subsidizes the foreign advertising of U.S. corporations such as Pillsbury, Dole, and Jim Beam. I would rate Congress's first-year performance on this issue as a disappointment. The size of the cutbacks were minimal. Some cuts were made--indeed, far more than were ever enacted by previous Democrat Congresses--but huge amounts of the corporate welfare state went untouched. Republican Rep. Scott Klug of Wisconsin acknowledges that ``we have not shown the same kind of fervor in cutting corporate welfare as we have in the social area.'' But if the Congress's performance was a disappointment, the Clinton Administration's was dismal. With few exceptions, the administration has shown itself hostile to even the modest corporate welfare cutbacks proposed by Congress. In fact, of the 25 corporate welfare programs examined in this study the administration's 1996 budget actually requested a 4 percent increase in spending (versus the 16 percent cut enacted by Congress). In addition, the president's vetoes of the GOP budgets target corporate welfare cuts as being too deep. Clinton has, at least for now, helped torpedo GOP efforts to shut down techno-grant programs, such as the Advanced Technology Program; to make even minor reductions in agriculture price support programs; to end costly and inefficient Department of Energy research projects; and close agencies such as the Department of Commerce, the nerve center of the Federal corporate welfare state. Over the past eighteen months, the Clinton administration proved itself to be corporate welfare's best friend. And the unfortunate result is that the corporate social safety net remains largely intact after 18 months of the ``Republican Revolution.'' Why weren't more cuts enacted, especially given the high profile attached to the issue in 1996? The original House budget resolution passed in June 1995 and crafted by this committee contained courageous and substantial reductions in corporate welfare. If implemented in full, the ``Kasich Budget'' would have constituted the largest assault against the corporate social safety net in history. As the table below shows, the list of business subsidy terminations Mr. Kasich compiled was impressive: the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Small Business Administration (SBA), the Export Import Bank, the Rural Electrification Administration (REA), the economic development administration (EDA), major farm programs, high technology pork grants, and many others. Three cabinet agencies, including the Departments of Commerce and Energy, were supposed to be terminated.

The Senate has been particularly hostile to getting business off the dole. But more important has been the Clinton veto pen. Why is it so vitally important for Congress to cut corporate pork out of the budget? The short answer is that attacking corporate subsidies is both good politics and good policy. It is good politics because it deflects the natural suspicion among voters that Republican budget cutters want to cut school lunches for poor kids in order to protect their rich corporate friends. Many Americans question the sincerity of Republican budget cutters who seem eager to end the dole for the poor, but not the Fortune 500--General Electric, Texas Instruments, IBM, and Pillsbury--all of which get several million dollars of grants from taxpayers each year. Cutting corporate welfare is good economics because very few of the industrial policy programs run out of Washington have a credible track record in terms of creating jobs or wealth. I applaud this Committee's commitment to redouble its efforts in the 1997 budget to cut business subsidies. But why wait until 1997? Why not cut corporate welfare right now? Here is how this can and should be done. Congress should immediately enact a budget recision spending bill that could be entitled ``The Corporate Welfare Elimination Act.'' This budget bill should terminate at least 20-25 business subsidy programs with a 6-year savings of at least $75 billion a year. The bill should target programs that have been universally targeted for extinction by groups such as the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the Progressive Policy Institute, and even in some cases the Nader group Essential Information. Spending programs included in this recision should include, but not be restricted to: The Small Business Administration The Advanced Technology Program Forest Service Road Building Federal Housing Admin. subsidies to mortgage lenders The Agriculture Marketing Promotion Program Manufacturing Extension Program National Technical and Information Administration International Trade Administration Department of Energy R & D funding The Maritime Administration Overseas Private Investment Corp. (OPIC) Agriculture Research Service Minority Business Development Admin. The Export Import Bank Economic Development Administration Congress should embark on a high profile national promotional campaign to sell this large deficit reduction package to the public. Passage of the corporate welfare cuts should be among the highest priorities in the remaining months of the 105th Congress. Eliminating budget subsidies for the Fortune 500 adds credibility to Congress's equally vital cutbacks in failed in social welfare programs. The corporate welfare reduction package should also be a central element of any ``deficit downpayment budget'' negotiations with the White House. One final point. Corporate welfare cutbacks should be restricted to spending programs, not tax loophole closings. To be sure, there are at least $50 billion in obnoxious special interest tax breaks in the internal revenue code carved out for corporate special interests. But there are compelling reasons why loophole closings should be left off the table--at least, for now. The principal one is that there are still at least $60 billion a year in direct taxpayer subsidies that have not been terminated on the expenditure side of the budget. Since the direct spending of taxpayers' dollars is the most offensive feature of the corporate welfare state, the expenditure subsidies should be the top priority of this Congress. More importantly, corporate welfare in the tax code should be eliminated in its entirety--all $50 billion worth--in the context of the revolutionary change in the tax code that is expected in 1997. Majority Leader Dick Armey's flat tax bill would eliminate all corporate welfare from the tax code in exchange for a single low rate tax system. Bill Archer's proposal for a national consumption tax to replace the income tax would immediately and forever end income tax preferences for businesses. Either of these proposals would lead to a far more equitable and efficient allocation of economic resources in the economy. In sum, corporate loophole closings should be achieved in exchange for dollar for dollar reductions in tax rates applied to individuals and businesses. To the extent corporate welfare is a deficit reduction theme, it should be in the context of cutting business subsidy expenditures. Americans are demanding deficit reduction and government downsizing that is fairminded and balanced--meaning that the budget knife is not spared on the most politically well-connected K Street special interests. Both the social welfare and corporate welfare states need to be reformed with equal urgency. Chairman Kasich. Grover, you are up. STATEMENT OF GROVER G. NORQUIST Mr. Norquist. Thank you, Chairman Kasich. Thank you for the opportunity to testify here and also for your leadership on this issue over the last several years. I am Grover Norquist. I run Americans for Tax Reform. In keeping with truth in testimony, Americans for Tax Reform does not and has never received any money from any government at any level. I have testimony which I have submitted in writing to you. It is on our website at www.atr.org. I just want to make a couple of brief comments. First when we are looking at corporate welfare, let's not just look at for profit corporations but also not for profit corporations. Some of the rural utility services, the power marketing authorities give money to not for profit corporations. They are corporations just the same and people get rich working for them. So we are looking at all corporations, I hope. Second, I do distinguish between government corporate welfare spending which are direct grants, checks written below market loans given to companies and institutions. Those are different than tax cuts or tax deductions or tax credits. I am in favor of in the context of tax reform moving to a single rate that taxes income one time and has a two-thirds requirement to raise taxes in the future. If there is some parts deductions or credits that we ought to be eliminating let's do that in the context of overall tax reform getting to a single rate tax. Otherwise, I do agree that May West's observation on sex are true about tax cuts. All tax cuts are good tax cuts. The examples, they have all been brought up, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation commends itself, the Export- Import Bank, the milk, peanut and sugar complicated cross- subsidy programs, cargo preference, the Jones Act, the entire Commerce and Energy Departments could be separated out from those parts that are corporate welfare and those parts that you actually need. I think it is time to shut down both of those departments. The base closings idea that several people have brought up here I think recommends itself. When we remember the history of Dick Armey's efforts to close bases, his effort was a miserable failure. It backfired. He said here are 20 really unproductive military bases, let's eliminate them. And the Congressmen and the Senators who represented those 20 ran out and each got five friends and they said, look, I have got a really stupid spending program at my base that I want you to help me protect and I will vote for your stupid spending program if you will help protect mine. So we not only didn't get rid of the 10 but we had all these other votes tied up which were traded for other bad spending programs. So it was counterproductive even though Armey thought well, I will pick the easiest 20, that would be easiest. We have done this before in corporate welfare. We take a look at OPEC and Eximbank and we figure, well, we will go after the smaller ones or the weaker ones or the really stupid and evil ones that everybody has got to see. But you just tell them you are coming, they go out, round up their friends and you get people swapping votes in a negative way on that. Therefore, the base closings idea that Dick Armey put together with Congressman Sharp of Indiana which said, look, we are just going to get rid of X number of bases, we will set up a commission and everybody in Congress says, well, there aren't any no good bases in my district so I am perfectly willing to let the Pentagon come up with a list and then we vote it up or down. Similarly, the people who get corporate welfare will look you in the eye and tell you they are not getting any corporate welfare so they have nothing to fear and I think it would be much easier to pass the commission idea with the target of $20 or $30 billion than to go after them one at a time. We just charge up that hill a number of times and get beat back and people trade votes. The other model--the first model is base closings, which we saw what happened when you tried to pick them off one at a time and we saw the success when you did them in a group. The other is the freedom to farm model. For years people were trying to get a handle on farm subsidies, which is a form of corporate welfare. And we just couldn't do it going after, talking to people. But when we said, look, farmers--there are a lot of regulations you don't like and there are some subsidies you do like; let us phase out the subsidies and let us eliminate the regulations. If we went to the business community and said we are going to take $20 billion of corporate welfare off the table and we are going to do an across the board tax cut of $20 billion, everybody who is not in the corporate welfare gravy train will say this is a complete win for us and we have a lot of allies. So sometimes if you are taking something away from somebody, what is it that the government does to these people that you could stop hurting them doing. And so a freedom to farm effort, I certainly think that Steve Moore's idea of requiring companies to list the corporate welfare they do get would be a tremendous asset in the public relations debate to reduce it. And lastly, the reason to get rid of corporate welfare is not just that it takes money from people who earned it and gives it to people who didn't earn it, as important as that is. Corporate welfare breeds corruption. If you have got people handing out tens and hundreds of millions of dollars, people will find ways to get that and they are not pretty and they are not honest. You want campaign finance reform, get rid of corporate welfare. You would be amazed how that will affect campaign financing trends. The other is it is a tremendous misdirection of energy. People who are creating enterprises and employing people should be out in America doing that, not here in Washington trying to get checks sent to them. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Mr. Norquist follows:] Prepared Statement of Grover G. Norquist, President, Americans for Tax Reform Chairman Kasich, other members of this committee, and ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the opportunity to address you this morning. My name is Grover Norquist, and I am the President of Americans for Tax Reform, an organization of over 90,000 individuals, corporations and associations that are concerned about the high level of taxation. I come before you today to speak briefly about corporate welfare spending. What is Corporate Welfare? Americans for Tax Reform defines ``corporate welfare spending'' as all direct government payments to public and private companies and corporations where the Federal Government does not receive a good or a service in return--particularly where the money goes to aid or assist a profit-making activity. Corporate Welfare may also include regulations that limit competition and increase corporate profits, such as the Davis-Bacon Act. ATR does not include tax breaks or tax incentives in its definition of ``corporate welfare spending'' because allowing taxpayers to keep more of their own money is not welfare. Any tax breaks that give particular businesses or industries ``unfair advantages'' should be eliminated as part of overall tax reform, where the revenues can be used to reduce tax rates. ATR's definition of ``corporate welfare spending'' consequently does not include government contracts derived through a competitive bidding process, where the government receives some product or service in exchange for the money expended. Moreover, although there are a lot of wasteful and redundant Federal programs, which should be eliminated, not all of them fall under the rubric of ``corporate welfare spending.'' This corporate welfare is harmful because it wastes taxpayers funds on profit-making corporations that should be paying their own way. It also distorts the private market, reducing economic efficiency and prosperity overall. In 1996, conservatives led the fight to restructure welfare for the poor, changing the system from a Federal handout program to one where recipients are given the means and incentives to help themselves out of poverty and become productive members of society. This year, Congress should take the next step to reign in wasteful, counterproductive government spending. ``Corporate welfare'' encompasses a broad range of government programs that give taxpayer funds to special interests to help them pad their bottom lines. In fact, ATR compiled a list of over 70 corporate welfare programs costing taxpayers almost $50 billion in FY1997 alone. These programs range in size and scope from a $200,000 program to compensate damaged fishing vessels to $4.23 billion in Federal subsidies to big agricultural companies like Dole and Archer Daniels Midland, increasing the cost of food and adding to the profit margins of some of the world's biggest and richest companies. For example, every year, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and the Market Access Program (MAP) spend and risk billions of your hard-earned tax dollars to subsidize risky overseas investments and foreign advertising of U.S. products to make it easier for U.S. companies to export their products. These advertising subsidies and loan guarantees should be borne by the companies that are lucky enough or well connected enough to receive them, not by the U.S. taxpayer, who is forced to help increase the sales of these lucky companies. While it strives to eliminate these taxpayer subsidies, however, Congress must carefully define ``corporate welfare'' to include only those programs where the government sends a direct subsidy or payment to a company and receives nothing in return, not including tax breaks or tax incentives in that list. We must beware of those politicians who wish to raise taxes on the American people rather than cut corporate welfare spending. Some politicians claim that by reducing or eliminating some tax preferences, they are targeting corporate welfare. Tax cuts are not corporate welfare. Government spending is. The government's failure to take your money is not a subsidy. Your income belongs to you, not the government. Thus, when Bill Clinton or Ted Kennedy claim that ``rich corporations are not paying their fair share'' of taxes, they are not speaking about ``corporate welfare,'' but about tax increases that they want to impose on these companies to help them fund more run-away government spending. Congress should join the lead of Chairman John Kasich who has vigorously fought to balance the budget on the backs of those who do not need or deserve Federal handouts, getting the government out of the pocket of the taxpayer. Corporate welfare is just one example of this undeserved largess, but it represents a battle that both left and right can cooperate on to halt the taxpayer subsidizing of businesses. I have attached to my testimony a list of ten top corporate welfare targets. Let me add that the Department of Commerce is an entire Cabinet Department devoted to corporate welfare. The Department's most basic mission is to use the power of government and taxpayer funds to advance corporate business interests. As Robert J. Shapiro, the Department's Undersecretary of Economic Affairs, has written, ``A lot of the program's in the Commerce [Department] are simply transferring resources from the taxpayers to influential companies.'' Moreover, nearly all of the Commerce Dept.'s programs duplicate activites performed elsewhere in the Federal Government. Indeed, the GAO reports that the Commerce Dept. duplicates the mission of at least 71 other Federal Departments, agencies, and offices. Consequently, this Dept. of Corporate Welfare should be abolished entirely. Any essential activities of the Department can and should be transferred to other relevant Departments or agencies. The Department of Energy deserves the same fate. Among its corporate welfare programs are Energy Supply, Research, and Development, Fossil Energy Research and Development, Uranium Supply and Enrichment, Energy Information Administration, Clean Coal Technology, the Power Marketing Administrations, and General Science and Research Activities. Both Energy and Commerce have been deeply plagued by scandal in recent years, demonstrating their too easy potential for misuse as corporate honeypots and loopholes for foreign penetration. If the Congress cannot do the right thing now and abolish these two corrupt and unpopular departments, then when can the taxpayers count on it for wise and careful administration of their hard-earned tax dollars? Chairman Kasich. Even though he didn't directly attack me in this testimony, Mr. McIntyre, I feel you have been--I don't know if you want to have a little retort to these guys. Is there anything you would like to say? Mr. McIntyre. Well, I must say I am sort of friendly with Steve, and I know Grover, and I don't really understand how they can take the position that if the government writes a check to General Motors with the green ink that is bad but if it writes it with blue ink then that is just fine. The distinction between giving a company a tax abatement and giving it a check when you are paying them to do the same thing, or you could be anyway, it is just beyond me to understand the distinction. Now, these are very smart guys that I am sure they can explain it to me some day. But I have been listening to them for years. As best as I can tell, they are fascinated with the lines in the budget that say spending and revenues--and if that is all that matters, I suppose that is all that matters. Back in the early eighties, the Members of Congress decided it was necessary to cut Social Security benefits for upper income recipients. But to satisfy the Democrats, they did it with a tax increase rather than a benefit cut. So they raised taxes on Social Security benefits for upper-income beneficiaries. That made the Democrats happy because it wasn't a Social Security cut. But it made the Republicans unhappy because it wasn't a spending cut. It is a strange world we live in. Mr. Moore. Just to make one quick response to that. I did not work for Ralph Nader so I am not as smart as my friend Bob McIntyre. But the fact is if you look at some of the listed programs that Bob McIntyre says are corporate welfare, I simply don't think that they qualify. Look, if we give a capital gains tax cut for business, that is a good thing, not a bad thing. I think the proper rate of capital gains is zero on our companies. If we allow companies a write-off on the business expenses that they have to build new factories and invest in technology and add factories that workers can work in, this is good for America, not bad for America. I think we ought to get rid of the deduction tables and allow immediate expensing. Now, Bob would say that is corporate welfare probably. I would say this is a good investment in America. It really depends how you define what some of these things are. One last point. If we want to get rid of some of the garbage in the Tax Code, and I believe with Bob there is a lot of it in there and corporations have carved out special interest loopholes, let's do that but let's fix the whole damn system at once. Mr. Norquist. If the government didn't cut your finger off, it didn't give you your finger. If the government doesn't take your money, it didn't give it to you. There is a big difference here between the government's failure to loot you and the government giving you something. And that is a distinction. There shouldn't be a capital gains tax. It is taxing income a second and third time. That is not corporate welfare. That is tax policy. We should have expensing. I am all in favor of moving to a single rate tax that taxes income one time and requires a supermajority to raise taxes. That is where I think over time we are heading to. But let's, if there is a deduction or a credit that got sneaked in because somebody was doing something, let's eliminate it without raising the total tax burden. Chairman Kasich. Let me--I was trying to give you a chance there, Bob. It didn't work out so well. We are going to get started into votes here. I have to say to you that, you know, I think the commission idea is an interesting idea. You can put a bill in to create a commission. It is never going to pass; I mean, not for a while. I can tell you it is not going to pass because these bills have been put in before and what you are doing is you are asking somebody to basically roll the dice when the Congress hasn't been committed to any notion of this anyway. So I would propose you have the two-step process. Now, I can suggest to you and this is the last time I think I can try this because I am frankly getting tired of this myself, turning this over to a young buck like Saxby, but if we could get Tom and Jill and Bob and Steve and Grover and Ralph to all sit down and find like two items, I think you have all mentioned the Advanced Technology Program except for Bob. And I know Ralph isn't for it so if we were to say let us show you, America, how silly this program is and we are going to spend some time this year charging up our membership and our organizations to visit their Congressmen and their Senators and to say that we think this program is just flat out wrong and if we actually put some energy behind it, we might get it done. Now, I know you come out with a lot of lists because I work with all of you and we know how painstakingly difficult it is to get anything on the list ever off the list because we keep putting them on a list year after year because we never get rid of any of them and it just seems to me as though it would be good for your base, it would be good for all of our constituents, if we were to just focus on two. I tried to get to 10 and that was a waste of my time. But can't we find two items where we can just give a little bit of our effort to try to get something done and get behind whatever it is you think we need to be behind. It should be a Republican and a Democrat. And let's just take really two ugly programs that we all agree on and just get something done because then I think it will give us an incentive to get more done. I wondered what you think about that, Steve. Mr. Moore. I totally agree. I think two--I would like to see more like 10. Chairman Kasich. Yes, but we can't get 10. We spent almost 1 year trying to get 10 items put on the table, and it was like dealing with the fifth grade, and I mean, I am just being honest with you. We couldn't get anybody to agree with anybody else, and we can't do 10. So I think we have got to cut it smaller, and I don't mean just have a list because we have a list. That means nothing. Are there two things that we can get a little bit fired up for that we can actually be successful on? I will tell you, the reason why the timber roads happened is because there was a constituency out in America that wanted it dealt with. We have just simply got to create a constituency for getting rid of something, and you know, if we got rid of it, it would be news and then people would like at your organizations and our organizations in the Congress as something that, hey, that is a victory for us. I am really begging you to help. I would just like to see us get something done, and at the same time, if we want to pursue a commission we can pursue a commission. Mr. Norquist. Let us do it. Mr. Schatz. Let me just add something to that. I think one of the things that we didn't look at that closely when we were talking about those 10 items was the politics of which one makes the most sense, where you can get the votes and where you are going to get the consensus? Look at our list here, our top 10 for the groups here includes Market Access Program and Advanced Technology, almost every one of those we will all agree on. So that is where you need to look. Now where is the opposition? Who is going to come out most strongly against it? The reason that OPIC was successful the first time is because we did it and they weren't really organized on the other side. Chairman Kasich. They weren't organized, and we were, and that is why it passed. Mr. Schatz. Right, and that is something else to think about. We have had votes on almost all of these over the years. Sometimes we get even further away, like Economic Development Administration seemed to be getting fewer and fewer votes, but we did cut it back. Now, ATP, the money is about 200 million less than it was a couple of years ago, but it just kind of stays there at the same level every year, and the same with Market Access. We kind of changed how the money goes out. So let us find something that we can sit down and agree on the strategy, agree on the politics and get a consensus and count some votes before we go out there. Chairman Kasich. Although I will say in regard to ATP, and this is a decision that I think has to be made jointly, but I think you folks need to start figuring out which ones you are most comfortable with. In the era of the Internet, and I mean, if you had the people from the Silicon Valley come in here who are really--either the venture capitalists or the business owners, the CEOs themselves, they won't tell you they want any ATP money. I mean, they think that is a joke out there. I mean, I have talked to them about it. They have no interest in it. I am sure they could line a couple people up to come in here, if the money is there, might as well take advantage of it, but they instinctively don't favor programs like that, and maybe you could even involve that part of the business community to help to defeat that. I mean, I think, Tom, you have hit on something, though, which is we have to consider the politics of which ones are the most right for plucking. Jill, you want to make a comment? Ms. Lancelot. Yeah, I do. I just want to say that the good news is I think that I too would like to see more than two. I certainly understand the problems that we had. I absolutely sympathize with it, but this does not tell the whole story because we were only allowed to have 10. Seven of these that are on here that my organization isn't marked on, we support getting rid of. So there is even more than what we have here in this list. I just want to also say politics is a problem. We need to strategize about that, but you mentioned it earlier, Mr. Chairman, grassroots. If we get the public behind us, we can do this, and lots of these organizations have enormous grassroots support, and we need to be tapping into the grassroots. We need to organize them, and that is the way to do it, and I am convinced that having bipartisan support from the House and the Senate and having organizations that are represented here today we can make that difference. Chairman Kasich. Other questions for the panel? Gentleman from Georgia. Mr. Collins. Mr. Chairman, I just have one question. The Americans for Tax Reform, the CATO Institute, Citizens for Tax Justice, Taxpayers for Common Sense, Citizens Against Government Waste, are you a for profit or not for profit organization? Ms. Lancelot. I am not for profit, and in the disclosure, we take no government grants. Mr. Schatz. We are also not for profit. We also don't take any government funds. Mr. McIntyre. We are not profit as well. We don't make any profit. Mr. Moore. Not for profit. Mr. Norquist. Not for profit. Mr. Collins. You don't pay any taxes either? Mr. McIntyre. We pay taxes on every penny we make. Mr. Collins. Individually? Mr. McIntyre. No. The organization breaks even. So if we were a for-profit business, Congressman, our taxes would still be zero. In other words, we are happy if you treat us as a for profit or a nonprofit because the tax will be identical. Chairman Kasich. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized. Mr. Hoeffel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If I can talk a little bit more about remedies, we heard from Mr. Nader earlier today. His primary remedy was a bill to eliminate all corporate welfare, to define it and then pass a bill eliminating it all based on the concept of zero based budgeting for those of you who were here, with the battle cry of let them start over again to justify any corporate breaks, welfare breaks they might want, and it is a very legitimate concept. Mr. Moore and Mr. Norquist embrace the commission idea based upon the Base Closure Commission with one up or down vote by Congress, no picking and choosing. My proposal is a commission but with the ability to amend-- for Congress to consider the recommendations of the commission but be able to amend it and pick and choose a little bit. I think that is a better process. I would be interested in the opinions of all five but particularly the three that didn't have an opportunity to address pro-commission, anti-commission or any other mechanism that you think Congress should use. Mr. McIntyre. Well, it seems to me that if you are going to make something significant happen, rather than symbolic, and symbols are nice but perhaps not as important as some people think, then you have to give the nonbeneficiary public, in which I include a lot of companies, a stake in it. So that means like in 1986 when we did tax reform--a big thing, very important--one of the reasons it was enacted was that half the companies in American were for it because they weren't getting big tax breaks. And today lots of American companies aren't getting corporate welfare to a significant degree. If you can offer them something as part of a tradeoff, they will be for it. If you get a significant portion of the business community on your side, you have a lot better chance of moving forward on this than if you don't have them, because they have lots of lobbying clout. So I think if there is going to be a major attack on corporate welfare you have to do it in a way that cuts the corporate rate a few points or does something to bring other companies on board because otherwise, you know, the ones that get nothing won't care and the ones that lose something will. Mr. Moore. I like the Nader idea. I like this idea of putting--you know, you and I, Mr. Chairman, have had this conversation for years. I kind of think that if we put a big package together with a big price tag on it, so the prize of getting rid of these things is big enough, you know, and you have an up and down vote on are you for corporate welfare or are you against it and every single Member of Congress has to stand up and say I am for it or against it, that is a tough vote. I know you disagree with me on this, but I just would like to see that vote taken. Mr. Kasich. If the gentlemen from Pennsylvania would just yield. Mr. Hoeffel. Yes. Chairman Kasich. Let me just give you a perfect example. I don't know if you were in the room, but we had Dan Miller saying we want to get rid of sugar, and then Mr. Chambliss comes in and he says, no, you don't understand, and so you put--I am just talking to you practically. You say, well, this is a vote up or down on corporate welfare. He doesn't have any problem voting against the bill that knocks out sugar because he doesn't think it is corporate welfare. So the rhetoric is, you know, the rhetoric is what does you in. It is like pork. Pork is something that happens to somebody else's district. So that is why I think the big package idea--I mean if you want to get something done, it is going to take everyone in this room to sit down and pick out two items and spend 1 month before a vote alerting your people to visit their congressman and doing a campaign out here on the steps like the people do when they really want something done, and then it gets done. Now, Grover's been very successful in the area of this tax pledge. OK. Why? Because he drives people crazy, and he has people in his organization that drive people crazy. Tom's put out a terrific list. His list is, you know, a hundred zillion dollars worth of savings. So what? Nobody cares. They go, well, I hear you and the guy from Citizens Against Government Waste announced this big list today. I said, yeah, what about it? They say, just heard about it. OK. Now, did the Yankees win today? I mean, it just doesn't have an impact unless you are going to force something to a vote, and if you say you are going to get a discharge petition, you will never get the Members to sign the discharge petition. That is why you have to focus on a couple. All the rest of the schemes, if you want to put a commission in, that is fine. We can push for all that, but I just--I know the success that you have when you go against certain things and how I think it works. Ms. Lancelot. And I want to make a comment. I have to say I totally agree with the chairman, although I would put a plug in for the idea of a bill because that is a great organizing tool for grass roots, and we can use that, and we can get steam, and then we can come back, which is what my strategy has been on several things, the gas cooled reactor and the advanced mill reactor, we had a bill, we had something out there, came back and then zeroed in on a few things, and we were able to eliminate some of these programs, and I think that it is something to talk about. Mr. Schatz. Since I was asked, let me address the commission idea. The basis of the commission that Mr. Armey put together came out of the Grace Commission's concept and that is the predecessor to Citizens Against Government Waste. So we are a little bit fond of the idea of an up or down vote, and I think the idea, and I understand Mr. Kasich's frustration and have worked with him many years on this whole issue. The idea of having just what is, quote, unquote, cover for the Members makes it a little bit more difficult to vote no. In other words, you can pick this whole list and say, well, I had to do something about corporate welfare, I am sorry my program was in there, but I had to do something. If you get to pick and choose, it gets political. Look at the base closing situation we are in now. The President decided that the depots in California and Texas shouldn't be closed or should be kept open and to vote for him, and now the Congress hasn't gone back to the base closing idea when we really need to close bases. So I think it is worth continuing to discuss, but from our standpoint we like the idea of the up or down vote. Mr. Hoeffel. The difference between the two, though, in the Base Closing Commission, everything under consideration is a military base, and if this corporate welfare commission were ever to be established, it would be considering tax breaks, subsidies, below market fees. It would be quite a mix of things that might make it a little bit harder to deal with as one big lump sum or one big proposal. Mr. Schatz. But if you did mix both, you would get Bob McIntyre and everyone else probably agreeing. If you had a cap like Steve had suggested 20 to 30 billion, whatever it is, it makes it a little more palatable to say, well, we are just taking a chunk of this, we are going after some things that are the most egregious, that this whole commission agreed on, and therefore, we should go 1 year at a time, where we do it every other year or something. That at least allows Members to feel like they are not doing everything at once because I don't think you want to take the whole thing at one time. Mr. Hoeffel. It would be nice to get some victories, to actually get something passed, get that momentum that the Chair has been talking about. Ms. Lancelot. Can I just say one other thing, which is we have been talking about corporate welfare for how many years? Chairman Kasich. Not that many, maybe three or four, since 1995. Ms. Lancelot. We haven't done much about it. So if we continue to just talk about it, again, what you are talking about is going after one or two and then we get rid of those, and then we go after the three and four, and then we go, and it takes a long time, and people think, oh, my goodness, it is much too long, but if we just talk about it all the time and not really go after it, and really focus, we are just--that is all it is going to be is talk--really believe that we can make headway, and we can make a difference if we focus in on one or two, three or four, up to 10 finally. Chairman Kasich. Well, I think we are going to wrap up the hearing. I am going to host a meeting for you five and Mr. Nader when we come back after the Fourth of July break and see if we can reach a couple of items. I am glad to support any effort. The problem we ran into is we actually announced a list of 10 or whatever it was a few years ago and couldn't get any Members to show up at the press conference, and I begged Rob Andrews from New Jersey to fly in. I couldn't get anybody else to show up at it. And then we offered--it sounds like we didn't do anything. We offered a number of amendments on the House floor where we got blown out every time because I think it was you, Jill, and three guys standing on the street corner shouting, you know, the world is coming to an end. That is all the support we had, and we just got killed. Although I have got to go back and talk about the one where we were successful. I mean, frankly we were successful in scaling some things back. Even with OPIC, we made some--what we thought were some steps, not sure we did, the same with a couple other areas of the government, but the one where we had the clear victory was in the area of the timber roads, and that was because that constituency out there was very active, and if we could find a couple and try to turn our people on to this, and probably won't be able to get much done this year because of the advanced nature of appropriations, maybe we can, we just have to see where we are, but if we can reach some agreement, and I can have some Democrats join me, along with some Republicans, maybe we can get somewhere. Ms. Lancelot. I would just like to make it clear from my point of view that was absolutely a victory on timber roads. There is still more to be done in the Forest Service. Forest Service still loses money on money losing timber sales, and we are still building roads. Chairman Kasich. Well, I want to thank my many friends for coming today and Mr. McIntyre--no, just kidding--so thank you all for being here, and that will conclude today's hearing.

In addition, under the powers enumerated in the Constitution, Congress has authority over financial and budgetary policy by levying and collecting taxes, duties, imposts and excises, and, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.\nHere is the legislative process, from introduction to enactment into law:\nLEGISLATION IS INTRODUCED\nAny member can introduce a piece of legislation.\nHouse:\nLegislation is handed to the clerk of the House or placed in the hopper.\nSenate:\nMembers must gain recognition from the presiding officer to announce the introduction of a bill during the morning hour. If any senator objects, the introduction of the bill is postponed until the next day.\nOnce introduced\nThe bill is assigned a number (e.g. H.R.51 or S.1077)\nThe bill is labeled with the sponsor's name.\nThe bill is sent to the Government Printing Office (GPO) and copies are made.\nSenate bills can be jointly sponsored.\nMembers can co-sponsor the piece of Legislation.\nCOMMITTEE ACTION\nThe bill is referred to the appropriate committee by the Speaker of the House or the presiding officer in the Senate. Most often, the actual referral decision is made by the House or Senate parliamentarian. Bills may be referred to more than one committee and they may be split so that parts are sent to different committees. The Speaker of the House may set time limits on committees. Bills are placed on the calendar of the committee to which they have been assigned. Failure to act on a bill is equivalent to killing it. Bills in the House can only be released from committee without a proper committee vote by a discharge petition signed by a majority of the House membership (218 members).\nCommittee Steps:\nComments about the bill's merit are requested by government agencies.\nBill can be assigned to subcommittee by the Committee Chair.\nHearings may be held.\nSubcommittees report their findings to the full committee.\nFinally, there is a vote by the full committee - the bill is \"ordered to be reported.\"\nA committee will hold a \"mark-up\" session during which it will make revisions and additions. If substantial amendments are made, the committee can order the introduction of a \"clean bill\" which will include the proposed amendments. This new bill will have a new number and will be sent to the floor while the old bill is discarded. The chamber must approve, change or reject all committee amendments before conducting a final passage vote.\nAfter the bill is reported, the committee staff prepares a written report explaining why they favor the bill and why they wish to see their amendments, if any, adopted. Committee members who oppose a bill sometimes write a dissenting opinion in the report. The report is sent back to the whole chamber and is placed on the calendar.\nIn the House, most bills go to the Rules committee before reaching the floor. The committee adopts rules that will govern the procedures under which the bill will be considered by the House. A \"closed rule\" sets strict time limits on debate and forbids the introduction of amendments. These rules can have a major impact on whether the bill passes. The rules committee can be bypassed in three ways:\n1. Members can move rules to be suspended (requires 2/3 vote).\n2. A discharge petition can be filed.\n3. The House can use a Calendar Wednesday procedure.\nFLOOR ACTION\nLegislation is placed on the Calendar:\nHouse: Bills are placed on one of four House Calendars. They are usually placed on the calendars in the order of which they are reported, yet they don't usually come to the floor in this order - some bills never reach the floor at all. The Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader decide what will reach the floor and when. Legislation can also be brought to the floor by a discharge petition.\nSenate: Legislation is placed on the Legislative Calendar. There is also an Executive Calendar to deal with treaties and nominations. Scheduling legislation is the job of the Majority Leader. Bills can be brought to the floor whenever a majority of the Senate chooses.\nDebate:\nHouse: Debate is limited by the rules formulated in the Rules Committee. The Committee of the Whole debates and amends the bill but cannot technically pass it. Debate is guided by the Sponsoring Committee and time is divided equally between proponents and opponents. The Committee decides how much time to allot to each person. Amendments must be germane to the subject of a bill - no riders (additional provisions) are allowed. The bill is reported back to the House (to itself) and is voted on. A quorum call is a vote to make sure that there are enough members present (218) to have a final vote. If there is not a quorum, the House will adjourn or will send the Sergeant at Arms out to round up missing members.\nSenate: Debate is unlimited unless cloture is invoked. Members can speak as long as they want and amendments need not be germane - riders are often offered. Entire bills can therefore be offered as amendments to other bills. Unless cloture is invoked, Senators can use a filibuster to defeat a measure by \"talking it to death.\"\nVote:\nThe bill is voted on. If passed, it is then sent to the other chamber unless that chamber already has a similar measure under consideration. If either chamber does not pass the bill, then it dies. If the House and Senate pass the same bill, then it is sent to the President. If the House and Senate pass different bills they are sent to Conference Committee. Most major legislation goes to a Conference Committee.\nCOMMITTEE ACTION\nThe bill is referred to the appropriate committee by the Speaker of the House or the presiding officer in the Senate. Most often, the actual referral decision is made by the House or Senate parliamentarian. Bills may be referred to more than one committee and they may be split so that parts are sent to different committees. The Speaker of the House may set time limits on committees. Bills are placed on the calendar of the committee to which they have been assigned. Failure to act on a bill is equivalent to killing it. Bills in the House can only be released from committee without a proper committee vote by a discharge petition signed by a majority of the House membership (218 members).\nCONFERENCE COMMITTEE\nMembers from each chamber (House and Senate) form a conference committee and meet to work out the differences. The committee is usually made up of senior members who are appointed by the presiding officers of the committee that originally dealt with the bill. The representatives from each chamber work to maintain their version of the bill.\nIf the Conference Committee reaches a compromise, it prepares a written conference report, which is submitted to each chamber.\nThe conference report must be approved by both the House and the Senate.\nTHE PRESIDENT\nThe bill is sent to the President for review.\nA bill becomes law if signed by the President or if not signed within 10 days and Congress is in session.\nIf Congress adjourns before the 10 days and the President has not signed the bill then it does not become law (\"Pocket Veto.\")\nIf the President vetoes the bill, it is sent back to Congress with a note listing his/her reasons. The chamber that originated the legislation can attempt to override the veto by a vote of two-thirds of those present. If the veto of the bill is overridden in both chambers, then it becomes law.\nTHE BILL BECOMES LAW\nOnce a bill is signed by the President, or the presidential veto is overridden by both the House and the Senate, it becomes a law and is assigned an official number.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Legislative Branch of Government\n- Kentucky's present Constitution, adopted in 1891 and amended several times since, contains a number of provisions that govern the legislative branch.\n- These provisions define session dates, legislative districts, terms and qualifications of office, the conduct of legislative business, legislative leadership, and legislative support staff.\nSession Dates\n- The General Assembly meets annually in Frankfort, convening on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in January.\n- In even-numbered years, sessions may not last more than 60 legislative days, and cannot extend beyond April 15. In odd-numbered years, sessions may not last more than 30 legislative days, and cannot extend beyond March 30.\n- A \"legislative day\" is defined as a calendar day, excluding Sundays, legal holidays, and any day on which neither house meets.\n- Special Sessions may be called by the Governor to deal with specific subjects. There is no time limit, but special sessions are usually brief.\nRules\nRules and Committees, adopted separately by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, when the General Assembly meets in Session, serve as a code governing the proceedings of the Senate and House of Representatives respectively, and their committees.\nNew Rules may be adopted at the beginning of each Session\nLegislative Districts\n- The General Assembly is required to divide the state into 38 Senate districts and 100 House districts.\n- Districts must be as nearly equal in population as possible, and although Section 33 of the Constitution prohibits the addition of a part of one county to another in defining a district or the joining of more than two counties to make a Representative district, a federal District Court has held that these provisions must give way to the standard of equality of representation required by the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution and also in Section 33.\n- A 1994 Kentucky Supreme Court decision (Fisher v. State Board of Elections, et al) recognized that counties must be split to achieve population equality to accommodate both principles to the extent permissible under federal law.\n- The counties forming a district must be contiguous, according to Section 33. Districts must be reviewed every 10 years and be re-divided if necessary.\nTerms and Qualifications\nA STATE SENATOR must:\n- be at least 30 years old;\n- be a citizen of Kentucky;\n- have resided in the state at least 6 years and in the district at least 1 year prior to the election.\nSenators are elected for four-year terms, with half the Senate elected every two years.\nA STATE REPRESENTATIVE must:\n- be at least 24 years old;\n- be a citizen of Kentucky;\n- have resided in the state at least 2 years and in the district at least 1 year prior to the election.\nRepresentatives are elected for two-year terms in November following the regular session of the General Assembly. The entire House is elected at the same time.\nLegislative Leadership\nSenate\nThe President and the President Pro Tem are elected by the full membership of that body.\nHouse of Representatives\nThe Speaker of the House and the Speaker Pro Tem are elected by the full membership of that body.\nLegislative Party Leaders - Senate and House\nFloor leaders, Caucus chairs and Whips - are selected by Democratic and Republican caucuses in both chambers during the organizational portion of the odd year session. These members are responsible for seeing that the interests of their parties are well served.\nLegislative Support Staff\n- The Constitution also specifies constitutional officers to carry out clerical and support activities for the General Assembly.\n- Among these are the Chief Clerks elected by each chamber, responsible for minutes of sessions, roll calls, bill calendars, recording committee assignments, certifying the passage of bills and resolutions, and the official Journal of each chamber.\n- The Sergeants-at-arms clear unauthorized persons from the floor of the House and Senate before each session and as otherwise directed; compel the attendance of members sent for by the House; direct the delivery of mail, supervise the pages, and clear the galleries if there is a disturbance.\n- Other officers authorized by the constitution include doorkeepers, pages, janitors, and cloakroom keepers.\nInterims\nInterims between sessions\nThe General Assembly is organized into standing committees with different jurisdictions during regular session. The work of standing committees concludes when the regular session is adjourned.\nThe period of time from that adjournment to the convening of the next regular session is known as the Interim. In an Interim (June to December), the work of the General Assembly is accomplished in committees. Committees active between sessions may be two types:\n- Interim joint committees formed from the standing committees of both houses. For instance, the Education Committee of the Senate and the Education Committee of the House become the Interim Joint Committee on Education after the regular session.\n- Special committees that are appointed by the LRC and function primarily during the Interim, usually to study a specific topic. Examples include the Tobacco Task Force, and the Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs.\nAll committees which meet during the Interim may discuss issues, prefile bills, and forward recommendations to the LRC and the General Assembly.

The Government Contract Review Committee, for example, is authorized by statute to examine the contracts let by state government agencies to non-governmental entities.\nHow A Bill Becomes Law\nIntroduction and Committee Referral:\n- A bill may be introduced in the House or Senate.\n- Each bill is assigned a number, read by title and sponsor, and referred to a standing committee by the Committee on Committees.\nCommittee Consideration:\n- Committee meetings are open to the public.\n- When there is sufficient interest in a subject, a public hearing is held.\n- A bill may be reported out of committee with one of the following reports: favorable, favorable with amendments, favorable with committee substitute, unfavorable, or without opinion.\n- A committee can kill a bill by failing to act on it.\nFirst Reading\n- When a committee reports a bill favorably, the bill is given its first reading and is placed in the Calendar for the following day.\nSecond Reading and then to Rules:\n- The bill is read by title a second time and sent to the Rules Committee.\n- The Rules Committee may recommit the bill or place it in Orders of the Day for a specific day.\nThird Reading and Passage:\n- \"I move that House Bill 100 be taken from the Orders of the Day, read for the third time by title only, and placed upon its passage.\" This motion, usually by the majority floor leader, is adopted by voice vote, and the floor is open for debate.\n- Following debate and amendments, a final vote on the bill is taken.\n- To pass, a bill must be approved by at least two-fifths of the members of the chamber (40 representatives or 16 senators) and a majority of the members present and voting.\n- If the bill contains an appropriation of funds or an emergency clause, it must be approved by a majority of the members elected to each house (51 representatives and 20 senators).\nWhat Happens Next?\n- If a bill is defeated, another vote is not likely unless two members who voted against it request its reconsideration, and a majority approves.\n- If a bill passes in one house, it is sent to the other chamber, where it follows much the same procedure.\n- Both houses must agree on the final form of each bill.\n- If either house fails to concur in amendments, the differences may be reconciled by a \"conference committee\" of senators and representatives.\n- Changes agreed to by this conference committee are subject to approval by both houses.\nEnrollment:\n- After passage by both houses, a bill is read carefully to make sure the final wording is correct.\n- The bill is signed by the presiding officer of each house and sent to the Governor.\nGovernor's Action:\n- The Governor may sign a bill, permit it to become law without signature, or veto it.\n- The Governor has 10 days (excluding Sundays) to act on a bill after it is received.\n- The bill may be passed over the Governor's veto by a majority of the members of both houses.\nTracing Legislative History\nStep 1\nYour legislative history research should begin with a Kentucky Revised Statute (KRS) number. For example:\nStep 2\nGo to the history portion at the end of the statute and find the Kentucky Acts chapter and year:\n- Created 1994 Ky. Acts ch. 181, Part 12, sec. 47, effective April 4, 1994.\nStep 3\nGo to the Kentucky Acts to identify the bill's sponsor and locate the Senate or House bill number at the chapter heading.\nStep 4\nUse the Final Legislative Record to find the legislative committee(s) to which the bill was assigned.\n- Mar 3 - to Labor & Industry\n- Mar 8 - reported favorably\n- Mar 17 - received in Senate\n- Mar 18 - to Labor & Industry\n- Mar 22 - reported favorably\nStep 5\nCheck with the Legislative Research Commission library to see if the committee minutes were taped during the session. *\nAudiotapes may be copied for $5.00 each or you may listen to them in the library.\nThe LRC Public Information Office may have a video of the committee meeting.\nStep 6\nCommittee minutes may reflect the names of people who discussed a bill and the votes taken on the bill.\nThese are available in the Legislative Research Commission library.\nStep 7\nHouse and Senate Journals can then be used to trace the action of the bill on chamber floors.

Expanding Medicaid, he writes, would “threaten even Texas with financial ruin.”\nTexas has the highest rate of uninsured residents in the country (25 percent), and it stands to enroll some 1.8 million new Medicaid recipients through the expansion. These are some of the poorest people in America, making less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level (just $31,000 a year for a family of four). In the first six years of the expansion, from 2014 to 2019, the total cost of insuring these Texans would be about $55 billion—not an inconsiderable sum. But the federal government would pay more than 95 percent of that amount; Texas’s share would be just $2.6 billion. That’s not chump change—but threaten Texas with financial ruin? Not by a long shot.\nWhat does threaten Texas with financial ruin is the fact that it has some of the most regressive, insane tax policies in the nation. According to Matt Gardner, executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), Texas is one of nine states without any broad-based state income tax. Back in 2008, the Center for Public Policy Priorities calculated that Texas could raise $7 billion a year through a modest personal income tax comparable to what its neighbor Kansas had at the time (6.45 percent for individuals making more than $30,000 a year). If Texas collected that amount annually through a personal income tax during the first six years of the expansion, it would raise $42 billion. That would pay for its share of the Medicaid expansion more than sixteen times over. (I suspect the state’s teachers, social workers, firefighters, police and other public employees would have some ideas on how to spend the surplus.)\nThat’s not all. In 2006, the Texas state legislature required school districts to cut their property tax rate and then failed to make up fully the difference with new taxes. The result was a $10 billion structural deficit in every biennial budget. If Texas just returned to the property tax rate it had before 2006, it would raise at least $30 billion in the six years of the expansion. Or in another words, it could pay for the Medicaid expansion more than eleven times over. (If Texas both passed an average state income tax and repealed its property tax cut, it could pay its share of the Medicaid expansion almost twenty-seven times over!)\nRick Perry is not alone. Ever since the Supreme Court allowed states to opt out of the law’s expansion of Medicaid without forfeiting all their Medicaid funding, at least five other Republican governors—led by Tea Party darlings like South Carolina’s Nikki Haley, Florida’s Rick Scott and Louisiana’s Bobby Jindal—have summarily refused to implement the expansion on the grounds that their states just can’t afford it. They’re as wrong as Rick Perry. The federal government covers 100 percent of the expansion in 2014 through 2016. In 2017, states begin sharing the cost, paying 5 percent; that share grows to 10 percent in 2020. States are never on the hook for more than 10 percent of the annual cost. To put that in perspective, states currently pay between 25 to 50 percent of current Medicaid’s costs.\nIn many cases, Republican governors have wildly exaggerated what Medicaid expansion would actually cost their state. For example, South Carolina’s Nikki Haley wrote in an op-ed that the “price tag to South Carolina tax payers” would be “an extra $1.1 to $2.3 billion” over the next six years. In fact, the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid Expansion and the Uninsured calculated that South Carolina would have to kick in between $470 million and $615 million, depending on how many people chose to enroll. Again, in the first six years of the expansion, the federal government would pay for more than 95 percent of the total costs, between $11.4 and $12.7 billion depending on the participation rate.\nSouth Carolina is also one of eight states that offers a substantial capital gains tax break, a policy that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest 20 percent. Since 1991, the state has allowed residents to deduct 44 percent of their long-term capital gains income from their taxes. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, in 2010, this tax break cost South Carolina about $115 million in revenue. If they were to raise only that amount annually during the first six years of the expansion by getting rid of the capital gains tax break, they’d raise $690 million—which would more than pay for the Medicaid expansion.\nLet’s take a look at another regressive state tax policy. In Iowa, Republican governor Terry Branstad has claimed that the Medicaid expansion is “unaffordable, unsustainable.” But Iowa is one of three states that allow taxpayers to deduct 100 percent of their federal income tax payments from their state taxes. As the ITEP points out in its report, this unusual tax break undermines the progressivity of federal tax policy and overwhelmingly benefits the top 20 percent, who enjoy between 76 and 83 percent of the cuts. In 2011, Iowa lost about $642 million in potential revenue to this tax break—that’s almost 25 percent of its total tax revenue! Governor Branstad himself made out quite well under this tax break. In 2011, he paid just $52 in state income taxes because he was able to deduct his 2010 federal taxes from his 2011 state income tax bill.\nWhat would expanding Medicaid to insure 115,000 residents cost Iowa between 2014 and 2019? Just $147 million. If folks like Governor Branstad paid their fair share of state income taxes, Iowa would raise almost $3.9 billion in those years. Or in other words, it could pay for the expansion more than twenty-six times over.\nIn Louisiana, Governor Bobby Jindal has said the state can’t “afford another entitlement program.” But his state also allows residents to deduct 100 percent of their federal income tax payments from their state taxes. If it didn’t, it would raise $642 million a year—or $3.9 billion over six years. By getting rid of this tax break for the rich, Louisiana could newly insure 366,000 people by 2019, at a cost of just $337 million to the state, more than eleven times over.\nFlorida is home to 3.8 million uninsured residents, about 21 percent of its population, the third highest rate in the country. Expanding Medicaid would bring coverage to at least 942,000 of those folks at a cost of $1.2 billion between 2014 and 2019.\nIt’s also home to one of the country’s most infuriating tax loopholes—the infamous “Rent-a-Cow” tax loophole—which allows developers to claim agricultural tax breaks by letting ranchers keep some cattle on industrial or commercial land. In 2006, the Associated Press estimated that this loophole costs the state $950 million a year. Granted, some of that goes to legitimate farms, but as the Miami Herald noted in a 2005 report, most of the top beneficiaries were not growing oranges (or any other kind of fruit).\nBy eliminating this agricultural tax break, Florida could raise at least $5.7 billion between 2014 and 2019, paying for its share of the Medicaid expansion almost 5 times over.\nNearby, the office of Governor Phil Bryant claims, “Mississippi cannot afford a Medicaid expansion.” But Mississippi and Pennsylvania are the only states that have state income taxes to refuse to tax retirement income at all. In 2011, the state’s annual tax expenditure report concluded that it would miss out in more than $341 million in potential revenue in 2012 as a result. By taxing retirement income, it stands to generate at least $2 billion in the first six years of the Medicaid expansion. That would pay its share ($429 million) more than four times over.\nFrom the very first salvo in the debate over healthcare reform, Republicans have cloaked their opposition to expanding coverage by resorting to fear-mongering and lies. Remember Sarah Palin’s “death panels”? That was rated PolitiFact’s 2009 “Lie of the Year.” Or how about the idea that the ACA amounts to a “government takeover” of healthcare? That garnered the PolitiFact honor one year later.\nAn equally powerful lie has been the notion that the ACA is just too expensive. Rush Limbaugh wildly asserts that the ACA is the “largest tax increase in the history of the world” (not true by a long shot, points out MoJo’s Kevin Drum). And Mitt Romney claims that “Obamacare adds trillions to our deficits.” In fact, when the CBO scored the bill in 2010, it concluded that the law would reduce the deficit by $124 billion over ten years.\nHysterically exaggerating the cost of healthcare reform is one tactic, but presenting those costs in isolation is another—and perhaps more insidious—tactic. As these charts illustrate, austerity itself is a lie. We are not broke. We can pay for healthcare reform—and for teachers, police, firefighters, welfare, food stamps and any number of social services—if we go to where the money is.\nWhat the false debate over the cost of Medicaid expansion obscures then is the real choice the GOP refusniks are making—to insure millions of Americans or to preserve tax cuts for the wealthy and cheer while those around us just die.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        *Editor’s note: This story has been updated throughout.\nAs he said farewell to the Texas Legislature in January 2015, Rick Perry couldn’t help but reflect on how energy technology and policy had transformed the state’s landscape — and fueled its economy — during his record 14 years as governor.\n“Today, horizontal slant drilling is tapping oil and gas fields unreachable just a few years ago,” he said, going on to scold New York for banning hydraulic fracturing. “In Texas, we have chosen jobs. We have chosen energy security, and we will one day end America’s dependence on hostile sources of foreign energy.”\nAlthough Texas’ longest-serving governor was, perhaps unsurprisingly, pro-oil and gas during his tenure, he didn’t simply nod to those iconic, staple fuels: “You can be proud that Texas produces more energy from wind turbines than all but five countries,” he said.\nIndeed, Perry left a nuanced energy legacy — including overseeing booms in fossil fuels and renewables — during his time in Austin. (Texas is now the No. 1 U.S. producer of both natural gas and wind energy.) Now, he is poised to take his experience to Washington, where President-elect Donald Trump has reportedly tapped him as U.S. secretary of energy. The appointment would mark a full repair in Perry’s relationship with Trump, whom he called “a cancer on conservatism” last year while the two men were in a crowded field for the Republican presidential nomination.\nIf confirmed, Perry would become the third Texan to land that job, which involves overseeing energy research and policy with ramifications on the economy, environment and national security. And he would certainly bring different perspective and background to the role than his two predecessors — nuclear physicist Ernest Moniz and Physics Nobel laureate Steven Chu.\nEnvironmentalists and others question Perry’s qualifications to lead the massive federal agency, particularly because he called for its elimination during his first unsuccessful presidential bid five years ago. While they concede that he championed renewables during his tenure, they also describe a more fervent support for traditional fossil fuels.\n“Judging by the past, he has backroom deals with special interests and big polluters — the rest of the economy and the air be damned,” said Jim Marston, the Texas head of the Environmental Defense Fund, recalling a 2005 executive order to approve coal plants that his group successfully challenged in court.\nLast year, Perry joined the board of Energy Transfer Partners, the Dallas-based company behind the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline; its CEO, Dallas billionaire Kelcy Warren, was a major supporter of Perry’s political endeavors.\nBut Perry’s intimate understanding, and support, of the energy business makes him the perfect choice, said former Texas energy regulator Barry Smitherman, the only person to have served both on the Texas Railroad Commission and the state’s Public Utility Commission.\n“He’s incredibly qualified. I mean, he was the CEO of our state during 14 years of incredible energy development,” he said, recalling Perry’s support of state energy regulators during the shale revolution and of new electric lines to deliver wind energy. “Gov. Perry has been at the epicenter of all these advances.”\nWashington D.C.-based power utility lawyer Joseph Hall said he suspects “Perry will be well-received by the energy sector.”\n“He’ll need to express his goals for the National Nuclear Security Administration [a semi-autonomous agency within the DOE], but Texas is a market leader on the policy, law and economics of the oil, gas and electric power industries,” Hall said in a statement. “He understands carbon policy, the oil and gas business and generation and transmission development.”\nHere’s a look back at Perry’s energy legacy in Texas.\nBooming oil and gas\nOil and natural gas production surged in Texas during Perry’s tenure — by roughly 260 percent and 50 percent, respectively. Those booms poured billions of dollars into state coffers and helped lift Texas from the country’s last recession. The phenomenon, however, also stirred concerns about air and water quality and strained infrastructure in some regions, including roads and emergency response capabilities.\n(Plunging oil prices since Perry left office have significantly slowed drilling and economic growth.)\nFor the most part, technological advances like hydraulic fracturing with horizontal drilling spurred this energy renaissance. But industry officials cheered Perry’s relatively low-tax, low-regulation environment and willingness to push back against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Energy companies also supported his calls to lift a moratorium on new deep-water drilling after the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion and spill ravaged the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Perry called it an “act of God.”\nPerry also signed a bill in 2003 that made permanent a controversial tax break for “high cost” natural gas that has saved drillers billions of dollars over the years in avoided payments.\nIn his final months in office, Perry called on federal leaders to construct a comprehensive energy plan and to speed up natural gas exports — partly to protect gas-dependent U.S. allies in Europe from Russian “aggression.”\nMaking Texas a wind powerhouse\nThe state’s wind power sector hardly existed when Perry took his oath of office, but Texas became the nation’s leader in wind energy generation during his tenure — and he helped steer that boom.\nIn 2000, wind farms generated just 116 megawatts of capacity on the state’s main electric grid. That number soared to more than 11,000 megawatts under Perry, with wind fuels about 10 percent of all generation. (On average, one megawatt-hour can power 260 typical Texas homes for an hour.)\nMarston, of the Environmental Defense Fund, said much of the renewable expansion wasn’t Perry’s idea but that he also supported it. That was likely because of job growth, not global warming, noted Smitherman, the former Texas energy regulator.\n“For us, wind development in Texas was never about climate change — it was about economic development and diversifying our portfolio,” he said, adding that it “is nicely diversified at the moment with natural gas, wind, coal and nuclear.”\nAs Texas governor, George W. Bush laid the groundwork for the state’s rapid wind energy growth. He signed a bill in 1999 that ultimately deregulated the electric sector — a mammoth undertaking that Perry would oversee — and established a renewable-energy requirement that kick-started wind development. Perry added to that in 2005 by signing legislation that required Texas to increase its renewable energy capacity to 5,880 megawatts by 2015.\nThe state shattered that goal before Perry left office.\nPerry also backed a $7 billion electrical transmission project to connect windy, largely empty West Texas to growing cities demanding more power. Completed in 2013, the Competitive Renewable Energy Zone initiative stretches nearly 3,600 miles and can send up to 18,500 megawatts of power — including from non-wind sources — across the state.\nSolar — not so much\nAdvocates were generally unhappy with Perry’s efforts on solar energy — or lack thereof. Because of its size and intense radiation, Texas leads the nation in solar energy potential, but the solar industry struggled to get a foothold during Perry’s tenure because lawmakers provided fewer incentives than other states.\nThough still just a fraction of the state’s energy portfolio, solar generation grown rapidly since Perry left, mostly due to improved technology that makes it cheaper.\nCoal\nPerry forged ahead on new coal plants while governor, even as some states had stopped permitting new ones amid pollution concerns.\nIn 2005, he issued an executive order to help rapidly approve coal plant permits. A power conglomerate planned to build 11 coal-plant units but ultimately scrapped plans for eight of the carbon-dioxide spewing units after environmentalists protested.\n“The biggest thing Perry did on energy was to try to fast-track 11 coal plants,” Marston, of the Environmental Defense Fund, told the Tribune in 2011. “And I think everybody in Texas ought to be glad that Perry’s plan failed.”\n“It would have been catastrophic for the climate,” he said in an interview Tuesday, describing it as “literally a backroom deal to help political donors.”\nPerry has also advocated for what supporters call “clean coal” — power plants that capture store and later sell those emissions to oilfield companies wanting to bolster productivity.\nHe set up a clean-coal technology council in 2002 and signed a bill with tax incentives for clean-coal plants in 2009.\nSince then, several such projects have struggled to get off the ground. Meanwhile, coal power has steadily lost market share to natural gas and renewables in recent years — in Texas and across the United States.\nStoring nuclear waste in Texas\nDuring Perry’s tenure, Texas became home to one of the nation’s few facilities that accept low-level nuclear waste. Since 2012, Waste Control Specialists in Andrews County, a company that was formally owned by the late Dallas billionaire and Republican donor Harold Simmons, has disposed of contaminated tools, building materials and protective clothing, among other items, from shuttered reactors and hospitals.\nOver the objection of environmental groups, that site rapidly grew during Perry’s final years in office and gained state permission in 2014 to double its capacity (if it wanted to) and reduce its financial liability should its owner suddenly close up shop.\nThis year, Waste Control Specialists applied for a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to store spent nuclear reactor fuel at its facility in West Texas — pitching it as a temporary solution to the problem of finding a final resting place for the highly radioactive waste.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy plays a major role in advancing and implementing policy on nuclear waste.\nIf Texas decided it would like to permanently store spent nuclear fuel, Congress would need to change the 1987 law naming Yucca Mountain as the nation’s repository for high-level radioactive waste. The U.S. House and Senate remain sharply divided on the issue.\nIn 2014, Perry ordered the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to evaluate the “challenges posed by spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste” that is currently stored at reactor sites.\n“Texas now faces the very real possibility that it will have to find a solution to the long-term issue of safe and secure handling of this waste,” he wrote in a letter accompanying the report, adding: “I believe it is time for Texas to act.”\nConflicts of interest?\nPerry’s critics suggest that conflicts of interest could cloud his tenure as energy secretary.\nAs governor, he accepted more than $14.3 million in campaign cash from energy and natural resource interests, according to the National Institute on Money and State Politics.\nTo join Trump’s Cabinet, Perry must comply with laws seeking to prevent financial conflicts of interest.\nHe would have to sell stock that might be seen as a conflict and potentially put those assets into a blind trust, said Larry Noble, general counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan campaign-finance watchdog group.\nPerry must also step down from any board positions that could conflict with his duties. That would likely include breaking any ties with Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners, which added him to its board of directors last year shortly after the end of his gubernatorial tenure.\nLed by CEO Kelcy Warren, a Texas Parks and Wildlife commissioner and major political donor who served as Perry’s campaign finance chairman during his 2016 presidential campaign, the pipeline giant is building the controversial Dakota Access natural gas pipeline that Native American groups have vigorously opposed and is currently stalled.\nPerry and Warren have long been close — personally, politically and professionally.\nVicki Granado, an Energy Transfer spokeswoman, did not return messages Tuesday. But the company’s website still listed Perry as a board member.\nFederal ethics statutes alone would not address critics’ broadest allegations of Perry’s coziness with industry executives, Noble said. It would be up to the U.S. Senate to evaluate those.\nThe energy ties certainly don’t seem to bother Texas’ Republican leaders, including some who view them as assets.\nPraising Perry and Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson, Gov. Greg Abbott said Tuesday that both potential Cabinet members would be beneficial for Texas.\n“They obviously know Texas. They understand Texas … especially the economic drivers of this state,” Abbott said. “And so we would have as both the head of energy and the chief international diplomat, someone who — both of them would be in positions to drive and enhance the Texas economy.”\nRead related Tribune coverage:\n- With President-elect Donald Trump set to tap former Perry to head the department of energy, here’s a closer look at the energy legacy of the state’s longest-serving governor.\n- If confirmed as energy secretary, Perry will oversee American energy policy and its ramifications on the economy, environment and national security.\nDisclosure: The Environmental Defense Fund has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune.

Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR.\nToday’s discussion is on the record. And the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy.\nWe are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards.\nSo, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it.\nI thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production?\nKISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you.\nSo, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world.\nAnd it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize.\nSo, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds.\nFASKIANOS: Fantastic.\nI thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic.\nKISSANE: Sure.\nSo, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil.\nYou know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day.\nSo, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand.\nAnd you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation.\nSo, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers.\nAnd again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision.\nNow, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+.\nAnd these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves.\nAnd then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand.\nBut again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies.\nAnd so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas.\nAnd then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand.\nAnd I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil.\nAnd again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day.\nAnd then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies.\nBut again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil.\nAnd again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less.\nSo, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great.\nSo now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments.\n(Gives queuing instructions.)\nAll right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself.\n(Pause.)\nYou are still muted.\n(Pause.)\nOK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK.\nLet’s go to Morton Holbrook.\nQ: Yes, good afternoon.\nDr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market?\nThank you.\nKISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question.\nYeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency.\nSo, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil.\nI think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system.\nOne of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten.\nSo, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand.\nNow, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil.\nAnd I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil.\nSo, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles.\nBut there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia?\nKISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one.\nSo, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done.\nAnd again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil.\nSo, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted.\nSo, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting.\nBut I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship.\nThat’s a great question.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand.\nQ: Hello?\nFASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open.\nQ: Can you hear me now?\nFASKIANOS: Yes.\nQ: That’s better. OK.\nFASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much.\nQ: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is.\nQ: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn.\nMy question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund?\nAnd thank you to Mrs. Irina.\nKISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar.\nSo, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question.\nQ: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund?\nKISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question.\nYou know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well.\nYou know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world.\nSo, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil.\nBut I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean.\nBut again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil.\nAnd you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR.\nBut thank you for the question.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil?\nKISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question.\nSo, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located?\nSo you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity.\nYou know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States.\nSo, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy?\nKISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much.\nYeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron.\nBut I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential.\nSo, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue.\nAnd another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself.\nQ: Can you hear me, please?\nFASKIANOS: Yes, we can.\nQ: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University.\nAnd my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent?\nKISSANE: Thank you.\nQ: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that.\nKISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question.\nYeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure.\nI think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based.\nAnd that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal.\nAnd I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important.\nAnd again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa.\nSo again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach.\nSo, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that.\nKISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question.\nYeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent.\nSo, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies.\nAnd so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition.\nSo, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition.\nSo, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change.\nSo you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami.\nQ: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program.\nJust to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries?\nFASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct?\nQ: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nKISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second?\nCan I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but—\nQ: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)?\nKISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries.\nYou know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there.\nSomeone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it.\nI think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward.\nFASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this?\nKISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made.\nYou know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil.\nAnd one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia.\nAnd we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to.\nAnd again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions.\nAnd you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it.\nA really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel.\nSo, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity.\nFASKIANOS: Thank you.\nI’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy?\nKISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference.\nYeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open.\nSo, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system.\nSweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero.\nWe also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy.\nSo, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear.\nSo, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system.\nFASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all.\nSo, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina.\nSo, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy?\nKISSANE: Great question.\nI think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play.\nI think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe.\nThat said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition.\nFASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for?\nKISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like.\nI think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical.\nSo, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex.\nSo, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead.\nFASKIANOS: Carolyn Kissane—Kissane, excuse me—thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion, for sharing your terrific insights with us, and to all of you for your questions and comments. I’m really sorry that we could not get to them all. But we only have an hour.

Great.\nFASKIANOS: And we look forward to your continued participation in this series.\nKISSANE: Thank you very much. Appreciate everyone’s questions. Bye.\n(END)\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        President-elect Donald Trump has focused much attention on shrinking the size and scope of the federal government for his second administration.\nMost notably, Trump has appointed tech mogul Elon Musk and GOP-primary-rival-turned-ally Vivek Ramaswamy to lead an advisory task force dubbed the “Department of Government Efficiency.” Musk and Ramaswamy have said they aim to cut trillions of dollars from the federal budget, abolish or consolidate hundreds of federal agencies, and slash the federal payroll by as much as 75%.\nAs Trump returns to the White House, here are answers to some common questions about the federal workforce, based on data from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) – the federal government’s human resources department – and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Unless otherwise stated, all figures in this analysis are as of March 2024.\nPew Research Center conducted this analysis to answer common questions about the federal workforce – particularly in light of pledges by the incoming Trump administration to shrink or remake it.\nOur primary source was the Office of Personnel Management’s FedScope data portal, which provides access to data on nearly all executive-branch civilian employees. The main exceptions are the U.S. Postal Service, congressional staffers, employees of the CIA and other intelligence agencies, and presidential appointees who require Senate confirmation.\nIn most cases, FedScope masks datapoints smaller than 12 to protect personal privacy. Also, for security reasons, FedScope masks work-location information for employees of the FBI, Secret Service, Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the U.S. Mint. Employees of those agencies who work in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area (which includes parts of Maryland and Virginia) are all reported as working in the District of Columbia, meaning the D.C. totals are artificially inflated. Location information for employees of those agencies who work elsewhere is suppressed.\nWe used civilian-employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to compare the federal workforce with the national workforce as a whole. We also relied on a Congressional Research Service report on the federal civil service for information about personnel rules for different classifications of federal workers.\nThe public opinion data cited in this analysis comes from recent Pew Research Center surveys. Additional information about the methodology of these surveys, including their sample sizes and field dates, can be found by following the links in the text.\n- How many federal workers are there?\n- How has the number of federal workers changed over time?\n- Which federal departments and agencies employ the most people?\n- Are most federal workers in the Washington, D.C., area?\n- How do federal workers compare demographically with American workers as a whole?\n- What kinds of work do federal employees do?\n- How much do federal workers earn?\n- What does job tenure look like among federal workers?\n- Do all federal workers have civil service protections?\n- How do Americans feel about federal workers?\nHow many federal workers are there?\nThat depends on who you’re counting.\nIn November 2024, the federal government employed just over 3 million people, or 1.87% of the entire civilian workforce, according to BLS data. That figure doesn’t count the roughly 1.3 million active-duty military personnel, who aren’t typically considered “employees.” It does include the more than 600,000 people who work for the U.S. Postal Service, an independent federal agency with semiautonomous status that operates somewhat like a private business.\nSet aside the Postal Service and you have a bit more than 2.4 million federal workers. That makes the federal government the nation’s single largest employer, with even more workers than Walmart, Amazon or McDonald’s. In fact, the Postal Service by itself would, if it were a private business, rank among the 10 largest private-sector employers, ahead of industry rivals UPS and FedEx.\nDetailed information on most executive-branch workers – 2,278,730 as of March 2024 – is available through OPM’s FedScope data portal. The rest of this analysis draws mostly from that database. FedScope doesn’t include postal workers, congressional staffers, employees of the government’s various intelligence agencies or presidential appointees who require Senate confirmation.\nHow has the number of federal workers changed over time?\nIn absolute terms, it has risen fairly steadily for decades. In November 2000, federal employment – excluding the Postal Service – stood at 1,855,900 people, according to BLS data. That number has grown by a little over 1% each year since then, to 2,405,100 people in March 2024.\nWhile the number of federal workers has grown over time, their share of the civilian workforce has generally held steady in recent years. The federal government (again excluding the Postal Service) accounts for 1.5% of total civilian employment, a share that – except for a temporary bump in mid-2020 for the decennial census – has been largely constant for more than a decade.\nThe Postal Service’s workforce, on the other hand, has fallen by a third since peaking at a seasonally adjusted 909,000 in April 1999. Despite the agency’s announced intentions to reduce headcount, Postal Service employment has hovered around 600,000 for more than a decade. (We used seasonally adjusted figures for this calculation because Postal Service payroll tends to bump up every December during the busy holiday season.)\nRelated: The state of the U.S. Postal Service in 8 charts\nWhich federal departments and agencies employ the most people?\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs employs more than 486,000 people, giving it by far the largest payroll of the 18 Cabinet-level departments (noting that OPM counts the Army, Navy and Air Force departments separately). Most of these employees work for the Veterans Health Administration, which operates the VA’s extensive network of hospitals, clinics and nursing homes.\nThe smallest Cabinet-level department, with 4,245 workers, is the Department of Education. Trump, like many previous Republican presidents, has proposed abolishing the department entirely.\nAmong independent agencies, the largest employer is the Social Security Administration, with more than 59,000 workers. That’s more than the combined total of five Cabinet-level departments: Education, Energy, Labor, State, and Housing and Urban Development.\nAre most federal workers in the Washington, D.C., area?\nNot by a long shot. Fewer than a fifth of the workers in OPM’s database – about 449,500 – work in the District of Columbia or the adjoining states of Maryland and Virginia. Outside that region, California and Texas have the largest contingents of federal employees, with about 147,500 and 130,000, respectively. About 30,800 federal employees work overseas.\nHow do federal workers compare demographically with American workers as a whole?\nThe federal workforce is slightly more male: 53.8%, versus 52.8% for all civilian workers. It also skews somewhat older: 28.1% of federal workers are ages 55 and older, compared with 23.6% of the overall workforce. Fewer than 9% of federal employees are younger than 30, compared with 22.7% of all workers.\nRacially and ethnically, the federal workforce largely mirrors the overall civilian workforce, with two notable exceptions: A bigger share of federal workers are Black (18.6% vs. 12.8%), and a smaller share are Hispanic or Latino (10.5% vs. 19.5%).\nAs a whole, federal workers are more educated than the overall civilian workforce. Nearly a third of federal workers (31.5%) have a bachelor’s degree, compared with 27.7% of all employed Americans. And almost 22% of federal workers have an advanced degree, versus 17.6% of all workers.\nThe most highly educated federal agency, among those with at least 1,000 employees, isn’t NASA or the National Science Foundation, but the U.S. Agency for International Development. Two-thirds of its 4,675 workers hold a master’s degree, doctorate or other advanced degree.\nWhat kinds of work do federal employees do?\nAlmost all federal employees (92%) are considered “white collar” workers – that is, in professional, administrative, technical, clerical or similar jobs. But the range of specific federal occupations runs literally from A (740 able seamen) to Z (43 zoologists).\nNearly 364,000 federal employees, or 16% of the federal workforce, are in health-related fields – the single largest occupational category. By contrast, only 134,239 federal workers, or 5.9%, are classified as lawyers or in law-related jobs.\nOut of more than 660 specific occupations that OPM lists, the most common are nursing and “miscellaneous administration and program work,” both with more than 111,000 workers; and information technology management, with about 99,000 workers. The federal government also employs some 14,000 custodial workers, about 2,500 welders, 580 cartographers and 21 bakers.\nHow much do federal workers earn?\nThe average annual pay across the entire federal workforce is $106,382, according to OPM, reflecting the skew toward white-collar jobs held by highly educated people. Half of all federal workers make between $50,000 and $109,999 a year. Relatively few (3%) make $200,000 or more, while 8% make less than $50,000.\nPay varies considerably based on what federal workers do and in which office or agency they work. Consider, for example, the agencies with the highest and lowest average salaries:\n- The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates futures contracts, swaps and other derivatives markets, employs 736 people who make an average of $235,910 a year. Nearly all of the CFTC’s workers are in professional or administrative jobs, including 273 attorneys, 122 in “general business and industry,” 68 information technology management workers, 43 auditors and 32 economists.\n- The Armed Forces Retirement Home, which despite its singular name operates two retirement centers for veterans, employs 306 people who make an average of $75,151 a year. Most of its workers are in health care, including 153 nurses, practical nurses and nursing assistants.\nWhat does job tenure look like among federal workers?\nMore than half of federal workers (1.18 million, or 51.8%) have worked for the government (in any civilian capacity) for less than 10 years, according to our analysis of the OPM data. The average tenure across the entire workforce is 11.8 years, but this too varies considerably from agency to agency.\n- The highest average length of service, among agencies with at least 100 employees, is at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. The museum, which opened in 1993, has 117 employees with an average tenure of 21.8 years.\n- AmeriCorps, the domestic volunteerism agency formally known as the Corporation for National and Community Service, has the shortest average length of service among major agencies. Its 785 workers have an average tenure of 7.5 years.\nFor comparison, the median job tenure for all U.S. wage and salary workers is 3.9 years, according to BLS data.\nDo all federal workers have civil service protections?\nMost, but not all, have these protections, which shield workers against being disciplined or fired except for just cause. Civil service protections also create specific procedures that agency employers must follow before firing or disciplining employees.\nAbout two-thirds of federal workers (1.5 million, or 67.3%) are in what’s called the “competitive service,” meaning that job applicants compete for positions and are evaluated based on objective criteria, such as written exams. Once they pass a probationary period, employees in the competitive service can’t be fired, suspended, demoted or subjected to other “adverse actions” without cause. They also have the right to written notice of such adverse actions and can respond to or appeal them.\nAround 8,700 federal workers (0.4%) are in a special classification called the “Senior Executive Service,” or SES. These high-level employees manage major programs and projects, and they often serve as intermediaries between presidential appointees and career civil servants.\n- About 90% of SES employees come from the ranks of the career federal workforce. In general, they can only be fired for misconduct, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or refusal to accept a transfer or reassignment. They can, however, be removed from the SES for unsatisfactory job performance.\n- About 10% of SES employees (around 850) are non-career federal workers or have been hired for a limited time. They can, in most cases, be fired or removed from the SES at the discretion of the head of their agency.\nAll other workers – roughly 735,000, or 32.2% – are considered “excepted service” employees, meaning their jobs have been exempted from the regular hiring rules. That’s often because their positions require specific skills and it’s considered impractical to examine applicants. Lawyers, teachers and chaplains, for example, often fall into this category.\nAlso part of the excepted service are employees in jobs of a “confidential or policy-determining character.” Most political appointees to positions that don’t require Senate confirmation are in this category.\nGenerally speaking, excepted service employees – except for the political appointees referred to above – have the same notice and appeal rights as workers in the competitive service. However, in most cases, those rights don’t become effective until after the worker has been on the job for at least two years, which in practice makes them easier to discipline or fire.\nLate in Trump’s first term, he issued an executive order that would have allowed agencies to move certain career employees – those whose jobs were determined to be of a “confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character” – into a new category of the excepted service. That would have made them easier to hire, discipline or fire, outside the usual civil-service rules. Estimates were that tens of thousands of career employees could have been reclassified under the plan.\nPresident Joe Biden revoked Trump’s order upon taking office, and earlier this year his administration adopted a new rule aimed at protecting career employees from being moved involuntarily to a classification with fewer job protections. However, Trump has said he will reissue the order in his second term.\nHow do Americans feel about federal workers?\nPew Research Center has regularly asked Americans about their views on the size and scope of government, their opinions of specific federal departments and agencies, and even whether they have more confidence in career employees or political appointees. Their responses indicate that Americans have, at best, mixed feelings about federal employees and the agencies they work for.\n- Americans are evenly divided on government’s size and scope: 49% say they’d prefer a smaller government that provides fewer services, while 48% say they’d prefer a larger government that provides more services, according to a survey conducted in April 2024.\n- A majority (56%) say government is “almost always wasteful and inefficient,” while 46% say it often does a better job than people give it credit for.\n- But 53% also say the government should do more to solve problems, while 46% say the government is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals.\n- Strong majorities express positive views of many federal agencies, including the National Park Service (76% favorable), the Postal Service (72%) and NASA (67%). Sentiment is more mixed toward other agencies, such as the CIA (44% favorable vs. 33% unfavorable) and the Education Department (44% vs. 45%). And sentiment is decidedly negative toward the IRS (38% vs. 50%).\n- In a 2022 survey, more people expressed a great deal or a fair amount of confidence in career government employees (52%) than in officials appointed by the president (39%). However, both those figures were down from 2018 (61% and 42%, respectively).\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        |\nIn 1993, President Clinton and Vice President Gore launched their economic strategy: (1) establishing\nfiscal discipline, eliminating the budget deficit, keeping interest rates low, and spurring private-sector\ninvestment; (2) investing in people through education, training, science, and research; and (3) opening foreign\nmarkets so American workers can compete abroad. After eight years, the results of President Clinton's economic\nleadership are clear. Record budget deficits have become record surpluses, 22 million new jobs have been\ncreated, unemployment and core inflation are at their lowest levels in more than 30 years, and America is in the\nmidst of the longest economic expansion in our history.\nPresident Clinton's Record on the Economy: In 1992, 10 million Americans were unemployed, the\ncountry faced record deficits, and poverty and welfare rolls were growing. Family incomes were losing ground\nto inflation and jobs were being created at the slowest rate since the Great Depression. Today, America enjoys\nwhat may be the strongest economy ever.\n-\nStrong Economic Growth: Since President Clinton and Vice President Gore took office, economic growth has\naveraged 4.0 percent per year, compared to average growth of 2.8 percent during the Reagan-Bush years.\nThe economy has grown for 116 consecutive months, the most in history.\n-\nMost New Jobs Ever Created Under a Single Administration: The economy has created more than 22.5 million jobs\nin less than eight yearsthe most jobs ever created under a single administration, and more than were\ncreated in the previous 12 years. Of the total new jobs, 20.7 million, or 92 percent, are in the private\nsector.\n-\nMedian Family Income Up $6,000 since 1993: Economic gains have been made across the spectrum as family incomes\nincreased for all Americans. Since 1993, real median family income has increased by $6,338, from $42,612 in\n1993 to $48,950 in 1999 (in 1999 dollars).\n-\nUnemployment at Its Lowest Level in More than 30 Years: Overall unemployment has dropped to the lowest level\nin more than 30 years, down from 6.9 percent in 1993 to just 4.0 percent in November 2000. The unemployment\nrate has been below 5 percent for 40 consecutive months. Unemployment for African Americans has fallen from\n14.2 percent in 1992 to 7.3 percent in October 2000, the lowest rate on record. Unemployment for Hispanics\nhas fallen from 11.8 percent in October 1992 to 5.0 percent in October 2000, also the lowest rate on record.\n-\nLowest Inflation since the 1960s: Inflation is at the lowest rate since the Kennedy Administration, averaging\n2.5 percent, and it is down from 4.7 percent during the previous administration.\n-\nHighest Homeownership Rate on Record: The homeownership rate reached 67.7 percent for the third quarter of\n2000, the highest rate on record. In contrast, the homeownership rate fell from 65.6 percent in the first\nquarter of 1981 to 63.7 percent in the first quarter of 1993.\n-\n7 Million Fewer Americans Living in Poverty: The poverty rate has declined from 15.1 percent in 1993 to 11.8\npercent last year, the largest six-year drop in poverty in nearly 30 years. There are now 7 million fewer\npeople in poverty than there were in 1993.\nEstablishing Fiscal Discipline and Paying off the National Debt\nPresident Clinton's Record on Fiscal Discipline: Between 1981 and 1992, the national debt held by\nthe public quadrupled. The annual budget deficit grew to $290 billion in 1992, the largest ever, and was\nprojected to grow to more than $455 billion by Fiscal Year (FY) 2000. As a result of the tough and sometimes\nunpopular choices made by President Clinton, and major deficit reduction legislation passed in 1993 and 1997, we\nhave seen eight consecutive years of fiscal improvement for the first time in America's history.\n-\nLargest Surplus Ever: The surplus in FY 2000 is $237 billionthe third consecutive surplus and the\nlargest surplus ever.\n-\nLargest Three-Year Debt Pay-Down Ever: Between 1998-2000, the publicly held debt was reduced by $363\nbillionthe largest three-year pay-down in American history. Under Presidents Reagan and Bush,\nthe debt held by the public quadrupled. Under the Clinton-Gore budget, we are on track to pay off the\nentire publicly held debt on a net basis by 2009.\n-\nLower Federal Government Spending: After increasing under the previous two administrations, federal government\nspending as a share of the economy has been cut from 22.2 percent in 1992 to 18 percent in 2000the\nlowest level since 1966.\n-\nReduced Interest Payments on the Debt: In 1993, the net interest payments on the debt held by the public were\nprojected to grow to $348 billion in FY 2000. In 2000, interest payments on the debt were $125 billion lower\nthan projected.\n-\nAmericans Benefit from Reduced Debt: Because of fiscal discipline and deficit and debt reduction, it is\nestimated that a family with a home mortgage of $100,000 might expect to save roughly $2,000 per year in\nmortgage payments, like a large tax cut.\n-\nDouble Digit Growth in Private Investment in Equipment and Software: Lower debt will help maintain strong\neconomic growth and fuel private investments. With government no longer draining resources out of capital\nmarkets, private investment in equipment and software averaged 13.3 percent annual growth since 1993, compared\nto 4.7 percent during 1981 to 1992.\nTo Establish Fiscal Discipline, President Clinton:\n-\nEnacted the 1993 Deficit Reduction Plan without a Single Republican Vote. Prior to 1993, the debate over\nfiscal policy often revolved around a false choice between public investment and deficit reduction. The 1993\ndeficit reduction plan showed that deficit and debt reductions could be accomplished in a progressive way by\nslashing the deficit in half and making important investments in our future, including education, health care,\nand science and technology research. The plan included more than $500 billion in deficit reduction. It also\ncut taxes for 15 million of the hardest-pressed Americans by expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit; created\nthe Direct Student Loan Program; created the first nine Empowerment Zones and first 95 Enterprise Communities;\nand passed tax cuts for small businesses and research and development.\n-\nNegotiated the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997. In his 1997 State of the Union address, President\nClinton announced his plan to balance the budget for the first time in 27 years. Later that year, he signed\nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997, a major bipartisan agreement to eliminate the national budget deficit, create\nthe conditions for economic growth, and invest in the education and health of our people. It provided\nmiddle-class tax relief with a $500 per child tax credit and the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax\ncredits for college. It also created the Children's Health Insurance Program to serve up to 5 million\nchildren and made landmark investments in education initiatives including educational technology, charter\nschools, Head Start, and Pell Grants. Finally, it added 20 more Empowerment Zones and 20 more rural Enterprise\nCommunities, included the President's plan to revitalize the District of Columbia, and continued welfare\nreform though $3 billion in new resources to move welfare recipients to private-sector jobs.\n-\nDedicated the Surplus to Save Social Security and Reduce the National Debt. In his 1998 and 1999 State\nof the Union addresses, President Clinton called on the nation to save the surplus until the solvency of\nSocial Security is assured. He also repeatedly vetoed large Republican tax cut bills that would have\njeopardized our nation's fiscal discipline. The President's actions led to a bipartisan consensus on saving\nthe surplus and paying down the debt.\n-\nExtended Medicare Solvency from 1999 to 2025. When President Clinton took office, Medicare was\nexpected to become insolvent in 1999, then only six years away. The 1993 deficit reduction act dedicated\nsome of the taxes paid by Social Security beneficiaries to the Medicare Trust Fund and extended the life of\nMedicare by three years to 2002. Thanks to additional provisions to combat waste, fraud and abuse and\nbipartisan cooperation in the 1997 balanced budget agreement, Medicare is now expected to remain solvent until\n2025.\n|\nClinton-Gore Economic Policy Has Dramatically Improved the Economy\n\"My colleagues and I have been very appreciative of your [President Clinton's] support of the Fed over the\nyears, and your commitment to fiscal discipline has been instrumental in achieving what in a few weeks will be\nthe longest economic expansion in the nation's history.\"\nAlan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board Chairman, January 4, 2000, with President Clinton at\nChairman Greenspan's re-nomination announcement\n\"The deficit has come down, and I give the Clinton Administration and President Clinton himself a lot of\ncredit for that. [He] did something about it, fast. And I think we are seeing some benefits.\"\nPaul Volcker, Federal Reserve Board Chairman (1979-1987), in Audacity, Fall 1994\nOne of the reasons Goldman Sachs cites for the \"best economy ever\" is that \"on the policy side, trade,\nfiscal, and monetary policies have been excellent, working in ways that have facilitated growth without\ninflation. The Clinton Administration has worked to liberalize trade and has used any revenue windfalls to\nreduce the federal budget deficit.\"\nGoldman Sachs, March 1998\n\"Clinton's 1993 budget cuts, which reduced projected red ink by more than $400 billion over five years,\nsparked a major drop in interest rates that helped boost investment in all the equipment and systems that\nbrought forth the New Age economy of technological innovation and rising productivity.\"\nBusiness Week, May 19, 1997\n|\nOpening World Markets to American Goods and Providing Leadership on Globalization\nPresident Clinton's Record on Trade and Globalization: In 1992, 10 million Americans were\nunemployed, new job creation was slow, and wages were stagnant. Other nations' high trade barriers limited the\nability of American businesses and farmers to sell their goods abroad and hampered economic recovery. Our trade\npolicies failed to reflect our values by failing to take into account the responsibility to protect our\nenvironment, eliminate child labor and sweatshops, and protect the rights of workers around the world.\nBut today:\n-\n300 Trade Agreements: President Clinton has opened markets for U.S. exports abroad and created American jobs through nearly 300 free and fair trade agreements.\n-\nThe Most U.S. Exports Ever. Between 1992 and 2000, U.S. exports of goods and services grew by 74 percent, or nearly $500 billion, to top $1 trillion for the first time.\n-\n1.4 Million More Jobs due to Exports: Jobs supported by American exports grew by 1.4 million between 1994 and 1998, with jobs supported by exports paying about 13 percent to 16 percent above the U.S. national average. Jobs related to goods exports pay, on average, 13 to 16 percent higher than other jobs.\n-\nLowest Inflation since the 1960s: Inflation is at the lowest rate since the Kennedy Administration, in part because global competition has kept prices low. It has averaged 2.5 percent under this Administration, down from 4.6 percent during the previous administration.\nTo Create Trade Opportunities and Expand the Benefits of Globalization, President Clinton:\n-\nWon Ratification of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993, creating the world's largest\nfree\ntrade zone of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. U.S. exports to Mexico grew 109 percent from 1993 to 1999, while exports to the rest of the world grew by 49 percent.\n-\nWon Approval of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. In 2000, Congress ratified permanent normal trade relations with China. The agreement will integrate China into the world economy through entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), open Chinese market to U.S. exports, slash Chinese tariffs, and protect American workers and companies against dumping.\n-\nSuccessfully Completed the Uruguay Round. The 1994 Uruguay Round transformed the world trading system, opening markets in a wide range of industries, enabling the U.S. to enforce agreements more effectively, and applying the rules for the first time to all WTO members (now 138 in total).\n-\nFought for the First-Ever African and the Caribbean Basin Trade Bills. The African Growth and Opportunity Act of 2000 will support increased trade and investment between the United States and Africa, strengthen African economies and democratic governments, and increase partnerships to counter terrorism, crime, environmental degradation and disease. The legislation will also create incentives for the countries of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin to continue reforming their economies.\n-\nPromoted Trade Opportunities for High Technology. The Clinton Administration completed series of trade agreements on technology, including the WTO's commitment to duty-free cyberspace, keeping the Internet free of trade barriers, in 1998; the global WTO agreements on Financial Services and Basic Telecommunications in 1997; the global WTO agreement on Information Technology in 1996; and a series of bilateral agreements on intellectual property, high-tech products, services and other sectors. These efforts are the building blocks of the New Economy.\n-\nSecured Historic Debt Relief. In March 1999, President Clinton presented a plan to a U.S.-Africa Summit in Washington that became the basis for the G-7 agreement in Cologne, Germany (known as the Cologne Debt Initiative). The plan would triple the amount of debt relief available for poor countries, reducing their debt by about 70 percent ($90 billion), in return for firm commitments to channel the benefits into improving the lives of all their people. In September 1999, the President announced that the U.S. would unilaterally exceed the terms of the G-7 initiative and entirely cancel the $5.7 billion in U.S. government debt owed by qualifying countries. In November 2000, President Clinton won $435 million from Congress for U.S. participation in the Cologne Initiative.\n-\nDramatically Expanded U.S. Efforts to Fight Child Labor and Expand Basic Education. In June 1999, the President traveled to the International Labor Organization (ILO) conference in Geneva, Switzerland, to urge adoption of an historic international convention banning the worst forms of child labor. He won $30 million for ILO enforcement of child labor laws and is fighting for a new initiative to promote basic education in areas of the world where child labor is widespread. In 2000, at U.S. urging, the G-8 countries endorsed the goal of universal basic education. President Clinton brought other issues to the forefront of the international economic agenda, including incorporating labor and environmental considerations in the work of major international economic institutions, increasing U.S. support for global efforts to fight HIV-AIDS and infectious diseases, and closing the digital divide.\n-\nDefused International Economic Crises. In 1995, after Congress refused to act, President Clinton made $20 billion in emergency loans to Mexico to stabilize the country's financial markets. Mexico repaid the loans in full, with interest, three years ahead of schedule. Following the Asian and Russian financial crises in 1997 and 1998, the Clinton-Gore Administration led a global effort to re-capitalize the International Monetary Fund to allow it to more effectively deal with these problems. President Clinton also insisted that the G-7 develop a set of measures to restore confidence in the world financial system.\n-\nPromoted U.S. Competitiveness. The Clinton-Gore Administration has made key investments in education and training for American workers and research and development. It has also maintained federal fiscal discipline, helping to reduce interest rates, encourage private-sector investment, and keep productivity high.\nRewarding Work and Empowering Communities\nPresident Clinton's Record on Rewarding Work: In 1992, unemployment reached 7.5 percent, the\nhighest level in eight years. Unemployment and poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanics were\nalarming: unemployment reached 14.2 percent for African Americans and 11.8 percent for Hispanics, and poverty\nrates for both groups were nearly 30 percent. But today:\n-\nHigher Incomes at All Levels: After years of stagnant income growth among average and lower-income families, all income brackets have experienced double-digit income growth since 1993. The bottom 20 percent saw the largest income growth at 16.3 percent.\n-\nLowest Poverty Rate in 20 Years: Since Congress passed President Clinton's Economic Plan in 1993, the poverty rate declined from 15.1 percent to 11.8 percent last year, the largest six-year drop in poverty in nearly 30 years. There are now 7 million fewer people in poverty than there were in 1993. The child poverty rate has declined more than 25 percent, the poverty rate for single mothers is the lowest ever, the African American and elderly poverty rates dropped to their lowest level on record, and the Hispanic poverty rate dropped to its lowest level since 1979.\n-\nLowest Poverty Rate for Single Mothers on Record: Under President Clinton, the poverty rate for families with single mothers has fallen from 46.1 percent in 1993 to 35.7 percent in 1999, the lowest level on record. Between 1980 and 1992, an additional 2.1 million households headed by single women were pushed into poverty.\n-\nSmallest Welfare Rolls Since 1969: Under the Clinton-Gore Administration, the welfare rolls have dropped\ndramatically and are now the lowest since 1969. Between January 1993 and September of 1999, the number of welfare recipients dropped by 7.5 million (a 53 percent decline) to 6.6 million. In comparison, between 1981-1992, the number of welfare recipients increased by 2.5 million (a 22 percent increase) to 13.6 million people.\nTo Help All Americans Benefit from Prosperity, President Clinton:\n-\nEnded Welfare as We Knew It. In 1996, President Clinton signed legislation requiring welfare recipients to work, limiting the time they can stay on welfare, and providing child care and health care to help them begin work. It also enacted tough new child support enforcement measures proposed by the President. In 1997, President Clinton won the welfare-to-work tax credit to encourage employers to hire long-term welfare recipients and $3 billion in additional resources to help communities move long-term welfare recipients into lasting, unsubsidized jobs.\n-\nRewarded Work by Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit. In 1993, President Clinton succeeded in winning passage of an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, giving a tax cut to 15 million of the hardest-pressed American workers. In 1999, the EITC lifted 4.1 million people out of poverty, nearly double the number lifted out of poverty by the EITC in 1993.\n-\nCreated Empowerment Zones. The 1993 Clinton-Gore economic plan created nine Empowerment Zones and 95 Enterprise Communities to spur local community planning and economic growth in distressed communities through tax incentives and federal investment. The President won expansions of the program in 1994, 1997, and again in 2000. To date, the 31 Empowerment Zones and 95 Enterprise Communities have leveraged over $10 billion in new private sector investment, creating thousands of new jobs for local residents.\n-\nCreated Community Development Financial Institutions. In September 1994, the President signed legislation creating the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund, a Clinton campaign proposal to support specialized financial institutions serving often-overlooked customers and communities. The Fund has certified over 400 CDFIs. It has provided over $427 million to match investments in CDFIs and to encourage traditional financial institutions to increase their lending, investment and services in under-served markets.\n-\nStrengthened the Community Reinvestment Act. In 1995, the Administration updated the Community Reinvestment Act regulations to focus on banks' actual service delivery, rather than on compliance efforts. From 1993 to 1998, lenders subject to the law increased mortgage lending to low- and moderate-income families by 80 percentmore than twice the rate they increased mortgage lending to other income groups.\n-\nEncouraged Investment in America's New Markets. In 1999, the President went on two historic \"New Markets\" trips to highlight the continuing need to bring investment to impoverished inner cities, rural communities and Native American tribal lands. In 2000, the President and Congress worked together to pass this bipartisan initiative to stimulate new private capital investments in economically distressed communities and build network of private investment institutions to funnel credit, equity and technical assistance to businesses in America's new markets.\n-\nRaised the Minimum Wage. In 1996, President Clinton and Vice President Gore fought for and won a 90-cent per hour increase in the minimum wage, helping 10 million workers.\n-\nHelped People with Disabilities Work. In 1999, President Clinton insisted that Congress pass the Work Incentives Improvement Act as a condition of the budget agreement. This bipartisan law allows people with disabilities to maintain their Medicare or Medicaid coverage when they work.\nModernizing for the New Economy through Technology and Consensus Deregulation\nTo Capitalize on the Information Technology Revolution, President Clinton and Vice President Gore Have:\n-\nModernized Financial Services Laws. In 1993, the laws that governed America's financial service sector were antiquated and anti-competitive. The Clinton-Gore Administration fought to modernize those laws to increase competition in traditional banking, insurance, and securities industries to give consumers and small businesses more choices and lower costs. In 1994, the Clinton-Gore Administration broke another decades-old logjam by allowing banks to branch across state lines in the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. President Clinton fought for and won financial modernization legislation, signing the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in November 1999.\n-\nReformed Telecommunications. In 1996, President Clinton signed legislation to open up competition between local telephone companies, long distance providers and cable companies. The law also requires the use of new V-chip technology to give families greater control over which television programming comes into their homes.\n-\nCreated the E-Rate. With the leadership of Vice President Gore, the Telecommunications Act contained the E-Rate initiative, which provides low-cost Internet connections for schools, libraries, rural health clinics and hospitals. More than 80 percent of America's public schools have benefited from the E-rate, which has helped connect 30 million children and up to 47,000 schools and libraries to the Internet. The percentage of public schools connected to the Internet has increased from 35 percent in 1994 to 95 percent in 1999. The percentage of classrooms connected to the Internet has increased from 3 percent in 1994 to 63 percent in 1999.\n-\nIncreased Resources for Educational Technology by Over 3,000 Percent. President Clinton and Vice President Gore increased our investment in educational technology by over 3,000 percent, from $23 million in FY 1994 to $769 million in FY 2000, including training over 600,000 new teachers to use technology effectively in the classroom.\n-\nPaved the Way for Electronic Commerce. President Clinton fought to eliminate legal barriers to using electronic technology to form and sign contracts, collect and store documents, and send and receive notices and disclosures, while ensuring that consumers on-line have the same protections that they have in the paper world. He signed the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act on June 30, 2000.\n-\nCreating Market Opportunities for Technology Firms. The Clinton-Gore Administration adopted a market-led approach on e-commerce, making spectrum available for digital wireless, and reforming Cold War export controls.\n-\nWorked to Close the Digital Divide. Since 1992, the President and Vice President have tripled funding for Community Technology Centers, which provide access to computers and the Internet to low-income urban and rural neighborhoods. President Clinton also challenged the private sector to develop new business models for low-cost computers and Internet access to make universal access at home affordable for all Americans. The Technology Literacy Challenge Fund has provided $1 billion in federal resources to help schools work with businesses and community organizations to put modern computers, high-quality educational software, and affordable connections to the Internet in every classroom. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 created a temporary tax deduction for donations of computers to elementary and secondary schools.\n-\nForged Trade Agreements on High Technology. The Clinton Administration completed series of trade agreements on technology, including the WTO's commitment to duty-free cyberspace, keeping the Internet free of trade barriers, in 1998; the global WTO agreements on Financial Services and Basic Telecommunications in 1997; the global WTO agreement on Information Technology in 1996; and a series of bilateral agreements on intellectual property, high-tech products, services and other sectors; all soon to be capped by the opening of a major networked economy initiative.\nInvesting in Educating and Training the American People\nPresident Clinton's Record on Investing in Americans:\n-\nMore Americans Are Enrolling in College: 66 percent of 1998 high school graduates enrolled in college or trade school the next fall, compared to 60 percent in 1990.\n-\nMore High School Students Are Preparing for College: The percentage of high school graduates who have taken four years of English and three years each of math, science, and social studies increased from 38 percent to 55 percent between 1990 and 1998. Research shows that high-quality academics in high school is key to college success.\n-\nMore Americans Are Earning College Degrees: Over 32 percent of 25- to 29-year-old high school graduates had earned at least a bachelor's degree in 1999, up from 27 percent in 1990. In particular, white and African American women have seen their college opportunities grow.\n-\nAmericans Are Becoming Lifelong Learners: 50 percent of adults participated in formal learning in the year prior to a 1999 survey, up from 38 percent in 1991.\nTo Provide Americans with More, Higher-Quality Education and Training, President Clinton:\n-\nCreated the College Tax Credits, the Largest Single Investment in Higher Education since the G.I. Bill. A $1,500 tax credit for the first two years of college, the Hope Scholarship will pay for nearly all of a typical community college's tuition and fees. The $1,000 Lifetime Learning Tax Credit reimburses families for 20 percent of their tuition and fees (up to $5,000 per family) for college, graduate study, or job training. Starting in 2003, the credit will reimburse families for 20 percent of their costs up to $10,000, for a maximum value of $2,000. This year, 10 million American families will save over $7 billion through the college tax credits.\n-\nDoubled Student Financial Aid. Students will receive over $50 billion in federal grants, loans, and work-study aid this year, up from $25 billion in 1993. President Clinton has consistently supported budget increases for Pell Grants; this year, over 3.8 million needy students receive a Pell Grant scholarship of up to $3,300, a $1,000 larger maximum grant than in 1993. The President won another increase for Pell Grants in the FY 2001 budget, bringing the maximum grant to $3,750. The President also won increases in work-study funding to help one million students pay for college.\n-\nCreated Direct Student Loans and Reduced Interest Rates. In the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, President Clinton won the Direct Student Loan program to improve customer service and compete with guaranteed lenders. It has saved taxpayers over $4 billion so far by eliminating lender subsidies. President Clinton also fought to reduce interest rates and fees in the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993 and the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. As a result, students can expect to pay $1,300 less in interest and fees for the average $10,000 loan than they would have in 1992. The student loan default rate is now 6.9 percent, down from 22.4 percent eight years ago.\n-\nCreated New Paths to College through GEAR UP, AmeriCorps, and TRIO. President Clinton won the new GEAR UP initiative in the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 which is already helping 700,000 low-income middle school students prepare for college. Over 150,000 Americans have earned money for college while serving their communities through President Clinton's AmeriCorps program, a campaign promise enacted in 1993. To help disadvantaged youth prepare for and succeed in college, the TRIO programs have grown by $342 million over the past eight years.\n-\nStrengthened Elementary and Secondary Education. In 1994, President Clinton reformed federal education initiatives in the Improving America's Schools Act and the Goals 2000 Act. The President's new approach was grounded in the principles that all of America's students should meet high academic standards and the federal government should make new investments to help them meet those standards. The President has also fought to hire 100,000 teachers, promote educational technology, support charter schools, build K-16 partnerships, and focus on early reading through America Reads.\n-\nPassed the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. In 1992, President Clinton and Vice President Gore proposed to streamline and bring greater accountability to our nation's job training system. In 1998, they won legislation to meet the needs of both America's workers and businesses by encouraging local control of training and employment programs; helping customers locate assistance through one-stop centers; and empower adults to receive the training they need.\nReducing Tax Burdens for Average and Hard-Pressed Working Families.\nThe Clinton Record on Reducing Taxes for Working Families:\n-\nLowest Federal Income Tax Burden in 35 Years: Federal income taxes as a percentage of income for the typical American family have dropped to their lowest level in 35 years.\n-\nHigher Incomes even after Taxes and Inflation: Real after-tax incomes have grown for Americans at all income levels, much faster than they did prior to the Clinton-Gore Administration. Real after-tax incomes grew by an average of 2.6 percent per year for the lower-income half of taxpayers between 1993 and 1997, while growing by an average of 1.0 percent between 1981 and 1993.\nTo Cut Taxes for Working Americans, President Clinton:\n-\nExpanded the Earned Income Tax Credit. In 1993, President Clinton succeeded in expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, giving a tax cut to 15 million of the hardest-pressed American workers. In 1999, the EITC lifted 4.1 million people out of poverty, nearly double the number lifted out of poverty by the EITC in 1993.\n-\nCreated the $500 per Child Tax Credit. In 1997, President Clinton secured a $500 per child tax credit for 27 million families with children under 17, including 13 million children from families with incomes below $30,000.\n-\nWon the Hope Scholarship Tax Credit. President Clinton proposed tax credits for college tuition in 1996 and signed them into law in 1997 as part of the balanced budget agreement. The Hope Scholarship provides a tax credit of up to $1,500 for tuition and fees for the first two years of college, roughly equal to the cost of the average community college. It will save American families $4.9 billion this year.\n-\nWon the Lifetime Learning Tax Credit. Also enacted in 1997, the Lifetime Learning tax credit provides a 20 percent tax credit on $5,000 of tuition and fees (to be raised to $10,000 in 2003) for college and graduate students and adults taking job training. It will reduce the cost of college and job training for American families by $2.4 billion this year.\n-\nEstablished Education IRAs. The 1997 balanced budget agreement also created Education IRAs. For each child under age 18, families may now deposit $500 per year into an Education IRA in the child's name. Earnings in the Education IRA accumulate tax-free and no taxes will be due upon withdrawal if the money is used to pay for college. The law also allowed taxpayers to withdraw funds from a traditional IRA without penalty to pay for higher education for themselves or their spouse, child, or even grandchild.\n-\nCreated Empowerment Zones. President Clinton created Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities in 1993 and expanded them in 1994, 1997 and again in 2000 to spur economic growth in distressed communities through tax incentives and federal investment. To date, the 31 Empowerment Zones and 95 Enterprise Communities have leveraged over $10 billion in new private sector investment, creating thousands of new jobs for local residents.\n-\nSimplified Pension Rules. In 1996, President Clinton signed the SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees) plan into law, simplifying and expanding retirement plan coverage for small businesses.\n-\nSimplified Tax Laws and Protected Taxpayer Rights. President Clinton signed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 to simplify the tax laws and enhance taxpayers' rights. The law has saved families and businesses millions of hours be simplifying and reducing paperwork, such as allowing a tax exclusion for income from the sale of a home.\n-\nClosed Tax Loopholes. To ensure that all taxpayers pay their fair share, the Clinton Administration addressed the use and proliferation of corporate tax shelters by proposing several remedies to curb the growth of such shelters by increasing disclosure of sheltering activities, increasing and strengthening the substantial understatement penalty, codifying the judicially-created economic substance doctrine, and providing consequences to all parties involved in an abusive sheltering transaction.\n|\nPRESIDENT CLINTON'S ECONOMIC POLICIES HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE\nTrade Expands Opportunity for American Workers\n\"Harley-Davidson is growing rapidly, and sales to other countries is one reason why. President Clinton's efforts to open foreign markets have made a difference and helped create jobs at Harley-Davidson.\"\nBobby Ramsey began working at the Harley-Davidson York plant in 1972 and is now responsible for inspecting all incoming motorcycle parts prior to the assembly process. Since 1995, Mr. Ramsey has also been his union's Chief Shop Steward, which entails handling all second step grievances of workers and helping represent his co-workers to management. U.S. exports of motorcycles and parts have grown by 15 percent a year from 1987 to 1998, reaching one-third of industry sales. Harley-Davidson will export 22 percent of the motorcycles produced in Mr. Ramsey's plant. By 2003, Harley-Davidson expects to double production from 1996 levels largely because of exports, creating new jobs for American workers.\n\"Kodak and its employees have experienced significant gains because of NAFTA. The NAFTA has enabled Kodak to realize considerable tariff savings and to make production decisions based on rational economic grounds rather than on tariff considerations. For example, the agreement has enabled Kodak to transfer a high-cost sensitizing operation for color negative film from Mexico to Rochester, New York. In all, NAFTA has been a win-win-win for Kodak's operations in Canada, Mexico and the United States.\"\nDan Carp, President and CEO of the Eastman Kodak company, credits NAFTA with Kodak's rapid growth in export sales. Eastman Kodak manufactures high technology imaging products for sale in 160 countries. Under NAFTA, Mexican duties on film and photo paper have been reduced from 15 to 30 percent to 6 to 9 percent, and they will be eliminated by 2004. Kodak's exports to Mexico have more than doubled since 1993, creating greater stability and more job opportunities for Kodak's 54,000 employees.\nMaking the Dream of Homeownership a Reality\n\"I feel true independence in owning my own home. To those who think it's impossible: It is possible. Don't let anyone talk you out of it.\"\nLucy Vocu, a teacher and single mother. Lucy Vocu has lived on the Pine Ridge reservation all her life. In 1985, Lucy got her GED, and in 1994, she graduated from Oglala Lakota College with a Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education. She currently works for the Shannon County school system at Wolf Creek School. Her children, Grace, 15, and Jacob, 7, spend a lot of time using their computer. Jacob recently tracked tornadoes on the Internet. Lucy is a first-time homeowner. She moved from a two-bedroom rental house into this new three-bedroom home, which offers more privacy. Lucy is excited about being a new homeowner and, if her budget allows, she hopes to add to her new home a swing set for Jacob and a basketball net for Grace.\n|\n|\n\"The social workers at Marion House, which has received funding from HUD's homeless grants, helped me get back on my feet. They counseled me on how to find a job and helped me learn the skills I would need to stay employed. Today I am newly married, and I have been working the last four years as a secretary for a social service agency. And I am delighted to say . . . I am a homeowner. Because of your leadership President Clinton, and because of your commitment to providing funding for homeless programs across the country, there will be hope and optimism in place of despair.\"\nChrista Spangler, of Baltimore, MD, December 23, 1998. Christa Spangler was a formerly homeless woman who hit rock bottom in 1994 when she was forced to live in her car. Previously, she had lost custody of her children, and spent eleven years in and out of halfway houses, rehab clinics, and hospitals. She found her way to Marion House, a Catholic transitional housing program for homeless women and children. Christa is now married, working as a receptionist and living in her own home. Federal resources pay 25 percent of the Marion House budget.\nEmpowerment Zones Are a Potent Weapon Against Poverty\n\"I am living proof that the Empowerment Zone works! If it wasn't for the Empowerment Zone, I would have never have had the chance to buy this building or to expand my business. We are fighting the war against poverty throughout our neighborhoods and cities, but we have a very potent weapon the Empowerment Zones. And we will use that weapon to win this war because, after all, our future and our children's future depends on it. We must never give up hope.\"\nNancy Santana, 37, is a single mother of three who lives in North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She used resources and a loan she obtained through her local Empowerment Zone to move from welfare to start her own business, Nancy Santana's Cleaning and Maintenance Services. Four years later, her business employs over 25 people, many of whom she recruited off of welfare.\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions Expand Economic Opportunity\n\"President Clinton's efforts have been very helpful to me. I had trouble getting funding from other sources. The Enterprise Corporation of the Delta has worked with me and people in my community, helping us improve our position in life. Now, I can get into this business, where otherwise I could not have.\"\nEphron Lewis co-founded Lewis & Sons Rice Processing the only African-American-owned rice processing company in the country with his father. The construction of his plant was made possible by a loan and technical assistance from the Enterprise Corporation of the Delta, a community development financial institution supported by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He now farms roughly 3,000 acres, producing rice, wheat and soybeans.\n|\n|\nEncouraging the Growth of Small Businesses\n\"I started my small consulting and legal firm with the principle that everyone should have a shot at the twin American dreams of owning your own business and owning your own home. I look for the dreamers, the ones who want to be a part of this country in the best way, but who don't have the tools and information they need. I hope to be an instrument of growth and change in Brooklyn's Latino community through increased business opportunities. This SBA loan will allow me to set up an office outside my home, close to where I can make the most of the services I have to offer.\"\nEnealia Nau, Small Business Owner from Brooklyn, NY. Enealia Nau is a first-generation American who operates a small business consulting firm from her home in Brooklyn. After putting herself through college and law school, Ms. Nau started her consulting firm that focuses on the legal and financial needs of the minority communities from which she draws her clients. Ms. Nau helps families from minority communities realize the American dream through starting their own businesses from beauty shops to corner stores and buying their first homes. She has seen many clients start from nothing and build prosperous lives for their families through small businesses, including one client who started with a small \"bodega\" and now owns one of the largest grocery stores in Brooklyn.\nExpanding Economic Opportunity by Closing the Digital Divide\n\"Bridging the technology gap in Indian Country is a major challenge, and I am grateful for the attention that the Clinton Administration has given to this critical issue. The National Congress of American Indians is building on the initiatives announced during the President's Digital Divide tour stop at the Navajo Nation in April 2000 through its Tribal Leaders Digital Divide Task Force, funded through the AOL Foundation. Through the Task Force, we are actively working with industry, federal officials, and others to forge a new tribal-based partnerships and policy recommendations to close the technology gap.\"\nSusan Masten, President, National Congress of American Indians, and Chairwoman, Yurok Tribe. Susan Masten has served as a strong advocate for the betterment of Native communities on a local, state and national level for 22 years.\n\"Community technology centers provide low-income individuals with skills training and the ability to produce their dreams. They are also an important entryway to the technology industry.

We continue to face an economic crisis that has left millions of our neighbors jobless and a political crisis that's made things worse.\nThis past week, reporters have been asking: \"What will this speech mean for the President? What will it mean for Congress? How will it affect their polls and the next election?\"\nBut the millions of Americans who are watching right now, they don't care about politics. They have real-life concerns. Many have spent months looking for work. Others are doing their best just to scrape by: giving up nights out with the family to save on gas or make the mortgage, postponing retirement to send a kid to college.\nThese men and women grew up with faith in an America where hard work and responsibility paid off. They believed in a country where everyone gets a fair shake and does their fair share, where if you stepped up, did your job, and were loyal to your company, that loyalty would be rewarded with a decent salary and good benefits, maybe a raise once in a while. If you did the right thing, you could make it. Anybody could make it in America.\nFor decades now, Americans have watched that compact erode. They have seen the decks too often stacked against them. And they know that Washington has not always put their interests first.\nThe people of this country work hard to meet their responsibilities. The question tonight is whether we'll meet ours. The question is whether, in the face of an ongoing national crisis, we can stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy. The question is whether we can restore some of the fairness and security that has defined this Nation since our beginning.\nThose of us here tonight can't solve all our Nation's woes. Ultimately, our recovery will be driven not by Washington, but by our businesses and our workers. But we can help. We can make a difference. There are steps we can take right now to improve people's lives.\nI am sending this Congress a plan that you should pass right away. It's called the \"American Jobs Act.\" There should be nothing controversial about this piece of legislation. Everything in here is the kind of proposal that's been supported by both Democrats and Republicans, including many who sit here tonight. And everything in this bill will be paid for--everything.\nThe purpose of the \"American Jobs Act\" is simple: to put more people back to work and more money in the pockets of those who are working. It will create more jobs for construction workers, more jobs for teachers, more jobs for veterans, and more jobs for long-term unemployed. It will provide a tax break for companies who hire new workers, and it will cut payroll taxes in half for every working American and every small business. It will provide a jolt to an economy that has stalled and give companies confidence that if they invest and if they hire, there will be customers for their products and services. You should pass this jobs plan right away.\nEveryone here knows that small businesses are where most new jobs begin. And you know that while corporate profits have come roaring back, smaller companies haven't. So for everyone who speaks so passionately about making life easier for \"job creators,\" this plan is for you.\nPass this jobs bill--[applause]--pass this jobs bill, and starting tomorrow, small businesses will get a tax cut if they hire new workers or if they raise workers' wages. Pass this jobs bill, and all small-business owners will also see their payroll taxes cut in half next year. If you have 50 employees making an average salary, that's an $80,000 tax cut. And all businesses will be able to continue writing off the investments they make in 2012.\nIt's not just Democrats who have supported this kind of proposal. Fifty House Republicans have proposed the same payroll tax cut that's in this plan. You should pass it right away.\nPass this jobs bill, and we can put people to work rebuilding America. Everyone here knows we have badly decaying roads and bridges all over the country. Our highways are clogged with traffic. Our skies are the most congested in the world. It's an outrage.\nBuilding a world-class transportation system is part of what made us a economic superpower. And now we're going to sit back and watch China build newer airports and faster railroads, at a time when millions of unemployed construction workers could build them right here in America?\nThere are private construction companies all across America just waiting to get to work. There's a bridge that needs repair between Ohio and Kentucky that's on one of the busiest trucking routes in North America. A public transit project in Houston that will help clear up one of the worst areas of traffic in the country. And there are schools throughout this country that desperately need renovating. How can we expect our kids to do their best in places that are literally falling apart? This is America. Every child deserves a great school. And we can give it to them if we act now.\nThe \"American Jobs Act\" will repair and modernize at least 35,000 schools. It will put people to work right now fixing roofs and windows, installing science labs and high-speed Internet in classrooms all across this country. It will rehabilitate homes and businesses in communities hit hardest by foreclosures. It will jump-start thousands of transportation projects all across the country. And to make sure the money is properly spent, we're building on reforms we've already put in place. No more earmarks. No more boondoggles. No more bridges to nowhere. We're cutting the redtape that prevents some of these projects from getting started as quickly as possible. And we'll set up an independent fund to attract private dollars and issue loans based on two criteria: how badly a construction project is needed and how much good it will do for the economy.\nThis idea came from a bill written by a Texas Republican and a Massachusetts Democrat. The idea for a big boost in construction is supported by America's largest business organization and America's largest labor organization. It's the kind of proposal that's been supported in the past by Democrats and Republicans alike. You should pass it right away.\nPass this jobs bill, and thousands of teachers in every State will go back to work. These are the men and women charged with preparing our children for a world where the competition has never been tougher. But while they're adding teachers in places like South Korea, we're laying them off in droves. It's unfair to our kids. It undermines their future and ours. And it has to stop. Pass this bill, and put our teachers back in the classroom where they belong.\nPass this jobs bill, and companies will get extra tax credits if they hire America's veterans. We ask these men and women to leave their careers, leave their families, risk their lives to fight for our country. The last thing they should have to do is fight for a job when they come home.\nPass this bill, and hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged young people will have the hope and the dignity of a summer job next year. And their parents, low-income Americans who desperately want to work, will have more ladders out of poverty.\nPass this jobs bill, and companies will get a $4,000 tax credit if they hire anyone who has spent more than 6 months looking for a job. We have to do more to help the long-term unemployed in their search for work. This jobs plan builds on a program in Georgia that several Republican leaders have highlighted, where people who collect unemployment insurance participate in temporary work as a way to build their skills while they look for a permanent job. The plan also extends unemployment insurance for another year. If the millions of unemployed Americans stopped getting this insurance and stopped using that money for basic necessities, it would be a devastating blow to this economy. Democrats and Republicans in this Chamber have supported unemployment insurance plenty of times in the past. And in this time of prolonged hardship, you should pass it again right away.\nPass this jobs bill, and the typical working family will get a $1,500 tax cut next year. Fifteen hundred dollars that would have been taken out of your pocket will go into your pocket. This expands on the tax cut that Democrats and Republicans already passed for this year. If we allow that tax cut to expire--if we refuse to act--middle class families will get hit with a tax increase at the worst possible time. We can't let that happen. I know that some of you have sworn oaths to never raise any taxes on anyone for as long as you live. Now is not the time to carve out an exception and raise middle class taxes, which is why you should pass this bill right away.\nThis is the \"American Jobs Act.\" It will lead to new jobs for construction workers, for teachers, for veterans, for first-responders, young people and the long-term unemployed. It will provide tax credits to companies that hire new workers, tax relief to small-business owners, and tax cuts for the middle class.\nAnd here's the other thing I want the American people to know: The \"American Jobs Act\" will not add to the deficit. It will be paid for. And here's how: The agreement we passed in July will cut Government spending by about $1 trillion over the next 10 years. It also charges this Congress to come up with an additional $1.5 trillion in savings by Christmas. Tonight I am asking you to increase that amount so that it covers the full cost of the \"American Jobs Act.\" And a week from Monday, I'll be releasing a more ambitious deficit plan, a plan that will not only cover the cost of this jobs bill, but stabilize our debt in the long run.\nThis approach is basically the one I've been advocating for months. In addition to the trillion dollars of spending cuts I've already signed into law, it's a balanced plan that would reduce the deficit by making additional spending cuts, by making modest adjustments to health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and by reforming our Tax Code in a way that asks the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to pay their fair share. What's more, the spending cuts wouldn't happen so abruptly that they'd be a drag on our economy or prevent us from helping small businesses and middle class families get back on their feet right away.\nNow, I realize there are some in my party who don't think we should make any changes at all to Medicare and Medicaid, and I understand their concerns. But here's the truth: Millions of Americans rely on Medicare in their retirement, and millions more will do so in the future. They pay for this benefit during their working years. They earn it. But with an aging population and rising health care costs, we are spending too fast to sustain the program. And if we don't gradually reform the system while protecting current beneficiaries, it won't be there when future retirees need it. We have to reform Medicare to strengthen it.\nI am also well aware that there are many Republicans who don't believe we should raise taxes on those who are most fortunate and can best afford it. But here is what every American knows: While most people in this country struggle to make ends meet, a few of the most affluent citizens and most profitable corporations enjoy tax breaks and loopholes that nobody else gets. Right now Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary, an outrage he has asked us to fix. [Laughter] We need a Tax Code where everyone gets a fair shake and where everybody pays their fair share. And by the way, I believe the vast majority of wealthy Americans and CEOs are willing to do just that if it helps the economy grow and gets our fiscal house in order.\nI'll also offer ideas to reform a corporate Tax Code that stands as a monument to special interest influence in Washington. By eliminating pages of loopholes and deductions, we can lower one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. Our Tax Code should not give an advantage to companies that can afford the best connected lobbyists. It should give an advantage to companies that invest and create jobs right here in the United States of America.\nSo we can reduce this deficit, pay down our debt, and pay for this jobs plan in the process. But in order to do this, we have to decide what our priorities are. We have to ask ourselves, \"What's the best way to grow the economy and create jobs?\"\nShould we keep tax loopholes for oil companies, or should we use that money to give small-business owners a tax credit when they hire new workers? Because we can't afford to do both. Should we keep tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, or should we put teachers back to work so our kids can graduate ready for college and good jobs? Right now we can't afford to do both.\nThis isn't political grandstanding. This isn't class warfare. This is simple math. [Laughter] This is simple math. These are real choices. These are real choices that we've got to make. And I'm pretty sure I know what most Americans would choose. It's not even close. And it's time for us to do what's right for our future.\nNow, the \"American Jobs Act\" answers the urgent need to create jobs right away. But we can't stop there. As I've argued since I ran for this office, we have to look beyond the immediate crisis and start building an economy that lasts into the future, an economy that creates good, middle class jobs that pay well and offer security. We now live in a world where technology has made it possible for companies to take their business anywhere. If we want them to start here and stay here and hire here, we have to be able to outbuild and outeducate and outinnovate every other country on Earth.\nAnd this task of making America more competitive for the long haul, that's a job for all of us, for Government and for private companies, for States and for local communities, and for every American citizen. All of us will have to up our game. All of us will have to change the way we do business.\nMy administration can and will take some steps to improve our competitiveness on our own. For example, if you're a small-business owner who has a contract with the Federal Government, we're going to make sure you get paid a lot faster than you do right now. We're also planning to cut away the redtape that prevents too many rapidly growing startup companies from raising capital and going public. And to help responsible homeowners, we're going to work with Federal housing agencies to help more people refinance their mortgages at interest rates that are now near 4 percent. That's a step--[applause]--I know you guys must be for this, because that's a step that can put more than $2,000 a year in a family's pocket and give a lift to an economy still burdened by the drop in housing prices.\nSo some things we can do on our own. Other steps will require congressional action. Today you passed reform that will speed up the outdated patent process, so that entrepreneurs can turn a new idea into a new business as quickly as possible. That's the kind of action we need. Now it's time to clear the way for a series of trade agreements that would make it easier for American companies to sell their products in Panama and Colombia and South Korea, while also helping the workers whose jobs have been affected by global competition. If Americans can buy Kias and Hyundais, I want to see folks in South Korea driving Fords and Chevys and Chryslers. I want to see more products sold around the world stamped with the three proud words: Made in America. That's what we need to get done.\nAnd on all of our efforts to strengthen competitiveness, we need to look for ways to work side by side with America's businesses. That's why I've brought together a jobs council of leaders from different industries who are developing a wide range of new ideas to help companies grow and create jobs.\nAlready, we've mobilized business leaders to train 10,000 American engineers a year, by providing company internships and training. Other businesses are covering tuition for workers who learn new skills at community colleges. And we're going to make sure the next generation of manufacturing takes root not in China or Europe, but right here in the United States of America. If we provide the right incentives, the right support--and if we make sure our trading partners play by the rules--we can be the ones to build everything from fuel-efficient cars to advanced biofuels to semiconductors that we sell all around the world. That's how America can be number one again. And that's how America will be number one again.\nNow, I realize that some of you have a different theory on how to grow the economy. Some of you sincerely believe that the only solution to our economic challenges is to simply cut most Government spending and eliminate most Government regulations.\nWell, I agree that we can't afford wasteful spending, and I'll work with you, with Congress, to root it out. And I agree that there are some rules and regulations that do put an unnecessary burden on businesses at a time when they can least afford it. That's why I ordered a review of all Government regulations. So far, we've identified over 500 reforms, which will save billions of dollars over the next few years. We should have no more regulation than the health, safety, and security of the American people require. Every rule should meet that commonsense test.\nBut what we can't do--what I will not do--is let this economic crisis be used as an excuse to wipe out the basic protections that Americans have counted on for decades. I reject the idea that we need to ask people to choose between their jobs and their safety. I reject the argument that says for the economy to grow, we have to roll back protections that ban hidden fees by credit card companies, or rules that keep our kids from being exposed to mercury, or laws that prevent the health insurance industry from shortchanging patients. I reject the idea that we have to strip away collective bargaining rights to compete in a global economy. We shouldn't be in a race to the bottom, where we try to offer the cheapest labor and the worst pollution standards. America should be in a race to the top. And I believe we can win that race.\nIn fact, this larger notion that the only thing we can do to restore prosperity is just dismantle Government, refund everybody's money, and let everyone write their own rules, and tell everyone they're on their own, that's not who we are. That's not the story of America.\nYes, we are rugged individualists. Yes, we are strong and self-reliant. And it has been the drive and initiative of our workers and entrepreneurs that has made this economy the engine and the envy of the world. But there's always been another thread running throughout our history, a belief that we're all connected and that there are some things we can only do together as a nation.\nWe all remember Abraham Lincoln as the leader who saved our Union, founder of the Republican Party. But in the middle of a Civil War, he was also a leader who looked to the future; a Republican President who mobilized Government to build the transcontinental railroad, launch the National Academy of Sciences, set up the first land-grant colleges. And leaders of both parties have followed the example he set.\nAsk yourselves: Where would we be right now if the people who sat here before us decided not to build our highways, not to build our bridges, our dams, our airports? What would this country be like if we had chosen not to spend money on public high schools or research universities or community colleges? Millions of returning heroes, including my grandfather, had the opportunity to go to school because of the GI bill. Where would we be if they hadn't had that chance?\nHow many jobs would it have cost us if past Congresses decided not to support the basic research that led to the Internet and the computer chip? What kind of country would this be if this Chamber had voted down Social Security or Medicare just because it violated some rigid idea about what government could or could not do? How many Americans would have suffered as a result?\nNo single individual built America on their own. We built it together. We have been and always will be \"one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all,\" a nation with responsibilities to ourselves and with responsibilities to one another. And Members of Congress, it is time for us to meet our responsibilities.\nEvery proposal I've laid out tonight is the kind that's been supported by Democrats and Republicans in the past. Every proposal I've laid out tonight will be paid for. And every proposal is designed to meet the urgent needs of our people and our communities.\nNow, I know there's been a lot of skepticism about whether the politics of the moment will allow us to pass this jobs plan or any jobs plan. Already, we're seeing the same old press releases and tweets flying back and forth. Already, the media has proclaimed that it's impossible to bridge our differences. And maybe some of you have decided that those differences are so great that we can only resolve them at the ballot box.\nBut know this: The next election is 14 months away. And the people who sent us here--the people who hired us to work for them--they don't have the luxury of waiting 14 months. Some of them are living week to week, paycheck to paycheck, even day to day. They need help, and they need it now.\nI don't pretend that this plan will solve all our problems. It should not be, nor will it be, the last plan of action we propose. What's guided us from the start of this crisis hasn't been the search for a silver bullet. It's been a commitment to stay at it, to be persistent, to keep trying every new idea that works and listen to every good proposal, no matter which party comes up with it.\nRegardless of the arguments we've had in the past, regardless of the arguments we will have in the future, this plan is the right thing to do right now. You should pass it. And I intend to take that message to every corner of this country. And I ask every American who agrees to lift your voice: Tell the people who are gathered here tonight that you want action now. Tell Washington that doing nothing is not an option. Remind us that if we act as one Nation and one people, we have it within our power to meet this challenge.\nPresident Kennedy once said: \"Our problems are manmade, therefore they can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants.\"\nThese are difficult years for our country. But we are Americans. We are tougher than the times we live in, and we are bigger than our politics have been. So let's meet the moment. Let's get to work, and let's show the world once again why the United States of America remains the greatest nation on Earth.\nThank you very much. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\nNote: The President spoke at 7:09 p.m. in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol. In his remarks, he referred to Sens.

We have been able to stop some layoffs in District 6, but so far haven’t been able to completely stop this surplus.\nAT&T has put forward a proposal to cut thousands of work hours from employees' schedules, while continuing to contract out work and send good jobs overseas. The contracting out of this work and AT&T's offshoring of good jobs is the real issue. AT&T must stop hiring contractors to do the same work that employees are qualified and trained to do.\nCWA members are frustrated, especially in light of AT&T's statements and pledge to invest at least $1 billion and create at least 7,000 good, middle class jobs, as CEO Randall Stephenson promised last year. CWA will continue to fight back against these job cuts and to demand that contracted work be performed by AT&T employees.\nCWA District 6 filed a federal lawsuit and National Labor Relations Board charges asserting that the company is violating the AT&T Southwest collective bargaining agreement by laying off workers while at the same time using contract employees to do work that CWA members are trained and qualified to perform.\nCWA District 4 disputed the company’s convoluted surplus process and is working to keep as many workers on payroll as possible.\nOther districts where AT&T is proposing to lay off workers later this month and in February and March have filed executive grievances challenging the layoffs and the company's use of contractors. CWA will pursue every possible avenue and take whatever action is necessary to stop these layoffs and keep good middle class jobs in our communities.\nCWA to American Airlines: Bonus No Substitute for Fair Wages\nCWA passenger service agents at American Airlines, Piedmont, and Envoy and AFA-CWA Flight Attendants who fly with the American Airlines brand will be receiving a $1,000 bonus this month. The bonuses came after CWA President Chris Shelton contacted the CEOs of some of the largest corporations where CWA members work, including American Airlines, to ask them to guarantee the $4,000 wage increase and new jobs promised by the Republican corporate tax cut.\nWhile CWA is pleased that the request has prompted American to pay employees a one-time $1,000 bonus, it falls short of the permanent wage increase that working families were promised.\nAmerican continues to pay poverty-level wages to passenger service agents at its Envoy and Piedmont subsidiaries. Passenger service agents play a critical role in ensuring the safety of thousands of passengers each day, yet many agents at these airlines earn less than $11 an hour and qualify for food stamps and other public assistance.\nThese agents, represented by CWA, are currently in contract negotiations. Despite American's continued profitability and the massive windfall from the tax bill, Envoy and Piedmont are refusing to offer fair wages as part of these negotiations.\n\"Passenger service agents at Envoy and Piedmont serve passengers in communities across this country, from big airports like Dallas-Fort Worth to smaller locations like Knoxville, TN,\" said Richard Honeycutt, CWA District 3 Vice President and Chair of CWA's Passenger Service Airline Council. \"It's time for American to invest in these communities by increasing wages so that working people at Envoy and Piedmont can have family-supporting and community-building careers, instead of living paycheck to paycheck.\"\n\"The White House and GOP leaders have said the tax plan will unleash 'growth of jobs and paychecks' in the U.S.,\" said Sara Nelson, president of AFA-CWA. \"Some corporations have started to respond following adoption of the new tax law and it seems the 'going rate' for investment in employees is a one-time bonus of $1,000. If the airline is benefiting from the new tax law, workers should share in that gain. Any long-term gain for the airline should result in negotiations for improvements for the workers. These improvements should be ongoing, long-term contractual improvements just like the corporate tax cuts. That's how workers know the promise of good jobs and wages will be fulfilled.\"\nBargaining Update\nEducation First\nAfter two years of negotiations, English-as-a-second-language teachers at EF Education First in Brighton, MA, members of TNG-CWA local 31245, voted unanimously this week to ratify a first-ever contract with the company providing improvements in pay, a path to full-time employment, scheduling, disciplinary processes, and more.\nEF is one of the world's largest education companies with 46,500 employees in 116 countries, but the 24 EF teachers in Brighton are the first U.S.-based employees to organize at the company. Their success may pave the way for more U.S.-based EF employees to gain workplace representation.\nThe Boston Globe featured a story on the teachers' fight for a fair contract:\nThe local starting rate for teachers at EF is $26-$29 per 80-minute class, plus $3.50 for 15 minutes of prep time, according to the teachers. They aren’t paid for the 10-minute breaks between classes, which are frequently filled with questions from students, or for the additional time it takes to grade papers, create tests, answer e-mails, or make photocopies. Teachers who work a full schedule start off making roughly $33,000 to $37,000 a year, with no pay during six weeks of school break, though they do get paid holidays. Some have second jobs as bartenders, tutors, or Uber drivers to make ends meet.\nCWA Families: Apply for 2018-2019 Union Scholarships\nUnion Plus Scholarship\nSince 1991, the Union Plus Scholarship Program has awarded more than $4.2 million to students of working families who want to begin or continue their post-secondary education.

Philip Randolph Institute, in which more than 500,000 Ohio voters were purged from voter rolls for infrequent voting. Many of the voters affected were seniors, students, and veterans.\nVoters were removed for not voting in recent elections even though federal law protects voters from being removed for this reason. Voting is a federally protected right – not a \"use it or lose it\" privilege that can be arbitrarily stripped away.\nOhio Secretary of State Jon Husted is attempting to shrink the power of the grassroots to advocate on issues that matter in their community – from local policies to holding elected leaders accountable. The A. Philip Randolph Institute, an AFL-CIO labor group advocating for social, labor, and economic change, says that Ohio's voter purging violates the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 and the Help America Vote Act of 2002.\nApproximately 50 million eligible citizens are not registered to vote in the U.S. And millions of voters could be targets of purging because they are infrequent voters, in many cases due to military service, illness, work, or school.\n\"You have a right not to vote,\" Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out in the oral arguments. \"[This policy] results in disenfranchising disproportionately certain cities where large groups of minorities live, where large groups of homeless people live, and across the country they're the group that votes the least, in—in large measure because many of them work very long hours. There's a strong argument this is, at least in impact, discriminatory.\"\nCummings: CWA Members Remain Committed to Preserving, Protecting and Expanding our Democracy\nCWA District 6 Vice President Claude Cummings, who heads CWA's Human Rights Program, issued this statement as part of the observation of the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.:\nEach year, Americans across the country observe the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., by engaging in community service. This year, I am honored to serve as co-chair of the AFL-CIO's annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Civil and Human Rights Conference, which will be held in my home town, Houston, TX.\nOur theme is \"Reclaiming Our Dream: Strategize, Organize, Mobilize.\" At this critical time for our country, activists and community leaders are joining together to use our collective power to ensure that working communities can thrive and families can enjoy the fruits of their labor.\nI am proud that CWA members have continued to lead this fight for economic and social justice. Through our Fight Forward program, CWA members are learning how they can be agents of change, then joining with allies to tackle the most pressing issues facing their communities. At a time when national political leaders are trying to roll back the clock and undo decades of progress, we remain committed to preserving, protecting, and expanding our democracy.\nWe're fighting to hold elected officials accountable to the people, not large corporations, by supporting public and small donor financing initiatives, like the one we helped pass in Howard County, MD, last year.\nWe're fighting to make sure everyone is treated fairly at work, negotiating contracts like the one at AT&T Mobility that protects working people against discrimination based on gender identity, even in 16 states where no non-discrimination law covering this category exists.\nWe're fighting for the right to vote, serving on the voting rights task force of the Leadership Council on Civil and Human Rights to challenge voter suppression legislation and successfully suing to ensure that state workers in New Mexico have paid time off to vote in municipal elections.\nWe're fighting for paid family leave, joining the Work & Family Coalition to win expanded family leave in California that includes employees working for small businesses.\nWe're fighting to protect working people from the threat of deportation by urging Congress to pass legislation that provides a path to citizenship for immigrants.\nWe're fighting for good, family- and community-supporting jobs, which is why CWA recently filed suit to prevent AT&T from laying off workers in their southwest region while continuing to outsource and offshore jobs.\nLast year Houston and southeastern Texas were devastated by Hurricane Harvey. In the aftermath of the storm, I stood shoulder to shoulder with people from all walks of life, as we distributed supplies and started the long process of rebuilding our communities. In that moment, I was reminded of Dr. King’s words, \"Everybody can be great, because anybody can serve.\"\nLet's strive for greatness as we work together to reclaim Dr. King's dream.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Guests: John Nichols, Tim Dickinson, Jim Moore, Tina Briones, Bob Shrum\nED SCHULTZ, HOST: Good evening Americans and welcome to THE ED SHOW\ntonight from New York.\nPresidential hopeful Rick Perry has added to his poll numbers\nrecently in his quest for the White House. But in his home state of Texas,\nhe`s been subtracting from the state`s education budget and it`s brutal.\nAnd as school districts consider raising taxes to pick up the deficit,\nGovernor Perry flip-flops again -- this time on the push for the\ninstitution of a national sales tax.\nLots on the table tonight.\nIt`s THE ED SHOW -- let`s get to work.\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\nGOV. RICK PERRY (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Education is a\npriority.\nSCHULTZ (voice-over): That was last year. This year, Rick Perry cut\neducation funding by an unprecedented $4 billion. And budget cuts means\njob cuts. This from the guy who`s running on job creation?\nRepublicans will do anything to prevent taxing the rich. But when it\ncomes to taxing the middle class and working poor, they`re all for it. Bob\nShrum is here with latest on the so-called anti-tax party`s proposed\npayroll tax increase.\nAnd in \"Psycho Talk,\" Mitt Romney is flip-flopping again -- this time\nabout whether terrorist trials should be held on U.S. soil.\nMITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The United States of\nAmerica would be my first choice.\nI don`t want them on our soil.\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\nSCHULTZ: Good to have you with us tonight, folks.\nI`ll tell you, down in Texas, the interesting stories just keep on\nsipping out. Rick Perry has created an absolute mess for public education\nin the Lone Star State.\nIf he becomes president, I`m convinced he`ll do the same thing to\nevery school in America. School districts across the state of Texas open\nthis week, $4 billion underfunded -- never happened in the state before.\nClass sizes are bursting at the seams and children are paying the price big\ntime.\n\"The Texas Observer\" reports, \"It`s the first time since 1949 the\nstate has decreased funding for education.\"\nBack in 2006, Perry ran for election as an education governor.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nPERRY: Public school funding, student achievement and standards are\nall up. I`m proud of Texas schools. Since I became governor, education\nfunding has raised $9 billion. We passed a $2,000 teacher pay raise in the\nnation`s largest merit pay program.\nWe`ve accomplished a lot, but we can still do more. That`s why we`re\ndirecting schools to spend at least 65 percent of their money on classroom\ninstruction.\nEducation is our future and my highest priority.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSCHULTZ: All right. Hell of a commercial. But is it the truth?\nEducation isn`t Perry`s top priority any more. Now, Perry is laser-\nfocused on becoming the leader of the free world when it comes to gutting\npublic education to pay for tax cuts for the superrich. Perry comes from\nthe same flock as Walker, Kasich and Christie.\nLast September, Perry was asked if he could assure public\nschoolteachers that they wouldn`t face cuts.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can you assure the educators of this state that\npublic school spending will not be cut in the next session?\nPERRY: Yes, I think so. I go back to 2003. It`s a priority our\nstate is still rolling. As a matter of fact, we put $1.8 billion more into\npublic education in the 2003 legislative session for the following biannum\nthan the previous biannum. This at the same time we were cutting $10\nbillion out of our budget spending. Reducing spending.\nAnd so, education is a priority.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSCHULTZ: Well, this is what local Texas news looked like four months\nlater.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today, public education cuts started at the\nvery top. The Texas education agency began laying off employees.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Texas school districts are tightening their\nbudgets. They`re going to be receiving millions of dollars less from\nAustin.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hundreds of AISD teachers and staff members\nlearned today they`re out of a job.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Perry requested state agencies find a way to\nshave off another 2.5 percent. And that`s directly related to the layoffs\nwe are seeing today.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSCHULTZ: Perry violated the trust of the public schoolteachers in\nTexas, and ultimately, it will damage the next generation.\nPerry loves to talk about his jobs record. But $4 billion in cuts\nwill cost thousands of public schoolteachers their jobs.\nThe cuts will also hit every kitchen table in the Lone Star State.\n\"The Observer\" reports, \"To cope, some districts are implementing fees for\nriding the bus or attending preschool, prekindergarten. And many are\nconsidering tax increases.\"\nSo, where is the deal here?\nRick Perry`s refusal to raise taxes on the rich oil boys in Texas has\nmade once again middle class Texans shell out more money to put Johnny and\nSally on the school bus.\n\"The Texas Tribune\" reports, \"In the Keller Independent School\nDistrict just north of Ft. Worth, students will ride the bus, they`re going\nto have to pay $185 each per semester.\"\nNow, let`s do some math here, folks. A family with three school aged\nchildren will have to pay over $1,100 a year to put them on the bus to ride\nto school? This kind of money is devastating for poor, middle income and\nlower class families.\nAnd remember, Texas leads the nation in minimum wage jobs. It`s\nreally hard to come up with $185 a semester per kid when you earn $7.25 an\nhour. I`m sure there`s a few folks like that down in Texas.\nBy the way, that would be working 51 hours a semester, just to cover\nyour kid getting on the bus.\nLarger class sizes, less money per pupil. You know what it`s going\nto do? It`s going to make it harder for children to graduate.\nThose facts mean nothing to Perry, because he`s all about the\nideology. When Perry gets confronted with the facts, you be the judge. He\nhas no answer.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why does Texas continue with abstinence education\nprograms when they don`t seem to be working? I think we have the third\nhighest teen pregnancy rate in the country, among all the states?\nPERRY: Abstinence works.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: But we are the third highest teen pregnancy -- we\nhave the third highest teen pregnancy rate among all states in the country.\nThe question or point is, it doesn`t seem to be working.\nPERRY: It works. Maybe it`s the way it`s being taught or the way\nthat it`s being applied out there. But the fact of the matter is, it is\nthe best form of -- to teach our children.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you give me a statistic suggesting it works?\nPERRY: I`m just going to tell you, from -- I`m going to tell from\nyou my own personal life, abstinence works.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSCHULTZ: That piece of video says it all, doesn`t it? Perry only\ncares about himself and his political future.\nPerry is the new normal in Texas and he`s the new normal in the\nRepublican Party. Tax cuts at all costs, warp social priorities, and I\nguess you could say blank stares at the camera.\nPerry`s attack on public education is dangerous -- a very dangerous\nrecipe for this country. Perry would end public education as we know it,\nand create a generation of minimum wage careers. America, I don`t think\ncan afford this guy.\nThe bottom line here is, in Texas, property taxes pay for schools.\nSo, what happens in the poor school districts? They stay poor. What\nhappens in the wealthy school districts? They have a hell of a lot better\nchance of seeing their kids succeed.\nNow, you ask yourself the question tonight -- is that the America you\nwant your kid to grow up in? Is that the America you want to see your\ngrandkids navigate through? Is Rick Perry really the guy when it comes to\npublic education?\nIt`s a sweet commercial, but, gosh, there are a lot of teachers\ntelling a different story.\nGet your cell phones out, I want to know what you think.\nTonight`s question: Are school children suffering because of\nRepublican priorities like tax breaks for the rich? Text A for yes, text B\nfor no to 622639. You can always go to our blog at Ed.MSNBC.com and make a\ncomment. We love that. And I`ll bring you the results of the poll later\non in the show.\nNow, let`s bring in Jim Moore, \"Huffington Post\" contributor and\nauthor of the upcoming book \"Adios Mofo: Why Rick Perry Will Make America\nMiss George W. Bush.\"\nMr. Moore, good to have you with us tonight.\nThe television commercial, I have to say, was filled with facts.\nThey were very positive, but it doesn`t seem to be matching up with the\nstory that`s being told by educators in the state. Decipher it for us.\nJIM MOORE, HUFFINGTON POST: Well, one of the things that we are\nnumber one in is the number of people over the age of 25, and the\npercentage of the population over the age of 25 without a high school\ndiploma. Rick Perry`s been governor for 10 years, he can`t exactly say\nthat`s not my fault.\nThis guy is a guy who has gone and said, I got to take $4 billion out\nof the public school system to get pressures down on the local tax\ndistrict.\nYou were talking, Ed, at about the way this whole thing works in\nTexas. We fund it with property taxes. And so, he`s claimed Social\nSecurity is a Ponzi scheme, but what he`s done with education is a shell\ngame. He`s able to say I`m cutting the budget, I`m not increasing taxes,\nbut it puts the downward pressures on to the local school districts. They\neither have to fire teachers, which the estimate is 100,000 teachers or\nthey have to increase taxes, go to their local property tax owners to the\n(INAUDIBLE) is going up, we got to have teachers, we`ve got to have\nschools.\nSo, Rick Perry can walk away and say I didn`t do it.\nSCHULTZ: A hundred thousand teachers. Yes, he can walk away and\nsaying, no, I didn`t raise your taxes, but the local school district had to\ndo it, or you wouldn`t have been able to make it and keep the programs and\ngive your kids an opportunity to advance in education. So, it`s a slick\nway of passing the buck, no question about it.\nBut is this a bigger and a grander scheme on the part of the governor\nof Texas? How does he really view education? And how should it be in\nAmerica?\nMOORE: Well, I think his view of education is basically that it`s do\nwhat you can with what you have. And the state will help out a very small\namount.\nLook, this guy has been pushing charter schools. He`s been pushing\nprivate schools. He`s been pushing Christian schools. And he`s been\nsaying to people, I want you to get your kids into these school systems.\nHow can you say that out of one side of your mouthing and turn around on\nthe other side of your mouth and say, I`m for education?\nHe has urged people over and over to take their kids in public and\nprivate events and said, get them into private schools, that`s where it`s\ngoing on. And the charter school program in Texas allows almost anybody to\nbecome a charter school owner and operator.\nSCHULTZ: So, they got loose rules down there?\n(CROSSTALK)\nMOORE: I`m sorry?\nSCHULTZ: They got loose rules when it comes to developing a charter\nschool?\nMOORE: It`s almost like a signature loan. It`s almost like a\nsignature loan. Create a charter school, and pay yourself whatever you\nwant and rent the buildings and charge the building rental off to the state\ntax money that comes in for each student. It`s a major scam.\nSCHULTZ: It is. Jim Moore, great to have you with us tonight. I\nappreciate your time.\nNow, let`s turn to Tina Briones. Tina has taught history in\ngovernment in Texas schools for 20 years and is now the president of the\nSan Antonio affiliate of the Association of Texas Professional Educators.\nTina, welcome tonight. These cuts, how real are they? What does it\nmean to classrooms?\nTINA BRIONES, PRES., SAN ANTONIO ATPE: The cuts are very real, Ed.\nThey`re affecting the classrooms in the class sizes have increased -- the\nelementary school and throughout the high school and so forth. They`ve\nalso -- they`re also going to affect the teachers. As you said earlier,\nthey`re going to lay off quite a bit of teachers. And that they`re going\nto do.\nA lot of districts were created this year. Not cutting a lot of\nteachers, however, they did do that. The next year, we`re not going to be\nsafe. They`re going to make a lot of cuts.\nSCHULTZ: But the commercial that Perry was paying throws out all\nthese numbers that he`s put into public education in Texas. What`s the\ntruth?\nBRIONES: Well, I`m not going to get into what he said and what the\ntruth is. I think you need to ask him.\nHowever, we are in a big shortfall. As you mentioned, we do have a\n$4 billion shortfall, that we can`t tap into the $9 million rainy day fund,\nwhich is now dwindled down to $6 billion. We can get into that, we can tap\nthat and help the schools out.\nIf they do tap into that, I assure you we won`t be in a situation.\nAfter all, the rainy day fund was made for these situations for education.\nSCHULTZ: Well, the rainy day fund. Why won`t he do that? And this\nwould shore up a lot of problems.\nBRIONES: It sure would. And everyone has asked him, we`ve had many\npeople stand up to him, write to him, write to the legislatures, they had\nthree choices, the legislatures had three choices. One was to raise taxes.\nThe second one was to tap into the rainy day fund. And the third was to\ncut spending.\nAnd they chose the latter, to cut spending. So, now, we feel that.\nSCHULTZ: Tina, do you think this is what Texas residents want? Do\nyou think this is what Americans want?\nBRIONES: No, I don`t. And I think they need to keep calling and\nmaking their voice known and heard.\nSCHULTZ: And when you look at a teacher who has 40 more students per\nday in some school districts, what does that do to their attitude?\nBRIONES: Well, it makes it hard. It makes for a long day. Their\nattitude is, it`s hard to deal with. However, most teachers in tell as are\ndoing the best they can. Like I said, you have the cuts are coming. And\nthey`re going to do their best to keep their jobs, and that`s not the right\nthing to do in raising their class enrollment.\nHowever, they`re going to do the best they can. And I don`t want to\nspeak on their attitude because most of them are coming in with a positive\nattitude. Very fortunate to have a job right now.\nSCHULTZ: So, would Rick Perry be good for America? Would he be good\nfor public education in your opinion?\nBRIONES: Public education -- his goals and what he`s done in Texas,\nit`s very sketchy. I can`t say yes to that.\nSCHULTZ: OK.\nBRIONES: I can`t.\nSCHUTLZ: Tina, thank you for joining us tonight. I appreciate your\ntime.\nRemember to answer tonight`s question there at the bottom of the\nscreen. We want to know what you think.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner thinks a majority of the economists agree\nwith Republicans on taxes. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, John, but\nthey actually do not agree with you.\nAnd Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham met with Libyan dictator\nMoammar Gadhafi less than two years ago. Pledging their support. Now,\nthey criticize President Obama for not moving fast enough to get rid of\nhim?\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nPERRY: Have you read my book, \"Fed Up\"? Get a copy of it, and read\nit.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSCHULTZ: Well, that was the second day of Rick Perry`s presidential\ncampaign. And he may live to regret his demand. Since then, a lot of\npeople have gotten a copy of Perry`s book. They have been surprised at\nwhat they found in there.\nFirst, there was the book suggestion that Social Security may be\nunconstitutional. Now, the focus is on part of the book where the Texas\ngovernor suggests the possible repeal of the 16th Amendment, which allows\nCongress to levee an income tax. Perry calls it \"the great milestone on\nthe road to serfdom.\" And said the 16th Amendment was \"the birth of wealth\nredistribution in the United States.\"\nPerry`s camp is already walking back the ideal of repealing the\namendment, saying in a statement, \"We can`t undo more than 70 years of\ntaxation and worsening debt obligations overnight.\"\nPerry may be running away from his statements, but it`s nothing\ncompared to how congressional Republicans are sprinting into the other\ndirection on taxes. More on that next.\nAnd later, this man is becoming the poster boy for Republican\noverreach. John Nichols tells us how Scott Walker has energized Democrats\nas he`s travelled across the nation.\nStay with us.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nSCHULTZ: Welcome back to THE ED SHOW.\nWhen it comes to taxes, Republicans are developing a pretty\nconsistent strategy. Whatever the reality is, just say the opposite.\nOn his Web site this week, House Speaker John Boehner highlighted a\nreport from the National Association of Business Economists claiming that a\nmajority of economists surveyed believe spending cuts are the key to\nreducing the federal deficit -- not job crushing tax hikes.\nThere`s only one more problem here, folks. The report clearly states\nthe exact opposite of what Boehner claims.\nOut of all the economists surveyed for the report, only 12 percent\nsaid the deficit should be reduced by spending cuts alone. The remaining\n88 percent said at least some amount of tax increases are necessary in an\noverall deficit plan.\nBut there is no surprise, the Republicans love playing the opposite\ngame with taxes. As we reported the other night, congressional Republicans\nwho complain about job crushing tax hikes are opposing President Obama`s\nproposed extension of the payroll tax holiday. That would amount to a tax\nincrease on 46 percent of all Americans, most of them poor and middle\nclass. Even radical anti-tax lobbyist Grover Norquist says he needs to\nwait to see the final legislation before weighing in on this tax hike.\nMake no mistake, folks, a tax hike is just that, a tax hike. If the\nRepublicans tell you anything differently, believe the opposite.\nLet`s bring in Democratic strategist Bob Shrum tonight.\nBob, good to have with us.\nIs this a fight that President Obama must see to the finish?\nBOB SHRUM, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Good to be here.\nSCHULTZ: Is this something that he can really put out there day\nafter day to fight for this payroll tax holiday, and is it a winning issue\nfor him?\nSHRUM: It`s absolutely a winning issue. And, look, the Republicans\nhere have a wonderfully Republican idea -- a tax increase of $1,000 to\n$2,000 a year, but only on people and incomes of $100,000 a year or less.\nThey hate Obama more than they hate taxes. The fact that he`s\nproposing this is the reason they`re going to oppose it.\nLook, these people represent the march of the economic morons.\nThey`ve been telling us the way to create jobs in the economy is to have\nless money in the economy.\nThe truth is they only care about tax cut when it affects the rich.\nRemember, Ed, how they talked about that waitress George W. Bush did in\n2000 who was going to get a tax cut under his plan? You know what\nhappened? She got the equivalent of a Diet Coke a day.\nVery wealthy people got millions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of\ndollars, sometimes billions of dollars in tax cuts and the country got a\nhuge deficit followed by a huge crash.\nSCHULTZ: I mean, these Republican legislators, these representatives\nand senators are home doing town halls. How can they stand up in front of\npeople and maintain their credibility when they say they`re against tax\nincreases when they won`t sign on with something like this.\nSHRUM: Well, they won`t be able to maintain it if the president gets\nout there and he makes a big proposal on this, and makes a big fight on\nthis. You know, all of this empty rhetoric about job-crushing tax\nincreases -- under Bill Clinton we had a top rate of 39.5 percent. We had\na full employment. We had a balanced budget.\nIt`s when we began the Bush tax cuts that we began to go into big\ndeficits and ended up losing millions of jobs.\nSo, I think the president can make his case, he can make it on both\nfairness and what`s right for the economy. By the way, these folks can`t\nread. If you read the report from the National Association of Business\nEconomists, you are absolutely right, they say we have to have tax\nincreases as part of the package.\nEither they can`t read those numbers, those conclusions, or they`re\nsimply lying.\nSCHULTZ: And what do you make of Grover Norquist position he has to\nsee the final legislation? Why do you make of it? And how influential is\nhe at this point on this issue?\nSHRUM: Well, I don`t -- you know, look, he wants to be for tax cuts,\nall tax cuts all the time. So, it`s pretty hard for him to oppose this\nbill which would prevent a tax increase. At the same time, he wants to get\nalong with the Republican Party.\nYou have a Republican Party, which is as I said earlier, detest the\npresident, hates the president more than tax increases.\nSCHULTZ: Yes.\nSHRUM: That`s why they`re confused here. Norquist maybe has a\nlittle more consistency from the cynical, political attitude of Boehner,\nEric Cantor and the rest, who just want to see to it by the way. They want\nto take this money out of the economy, because they want to see to it, with\nthe economy`s in bad shape next year, they hope they can stall the\nrecovery, so that they can ride the power on economic ruin.\nSCHULTZ: Do you anticipate any of the Republican candidates to come\nout in favor of this? I mean, Romney loves to say he`s the job creator.\nYou know, Perry talks about what kind of jobs he`s created down there.\nI mean, it would seem to me this is something they would be on safe\nterritory if they stepped up and said they were for it.\nSHRUM: Yes, look, Romney`s fallen apart as the front-runner. All\nthe new polls show Perry moving well ahead of him. Romney is not going to\ndo anything to offend the Tea Party folks, although trying to kowtow to\nthem so far hasn`t seemed to work for him.\nPerry certainly will not break with the congressional Republicans.\nThe Tea Party types on this.\nAnd the Tea Party folks, leadership, who in essence are really\nconservative Republicans, who don`t care about those ordinary middle class\nfolks -- there are members of the Tea Party who do, and who are middle\nclass, but the leadership is exploiting those people. They really care\nabout tax cuts for the wealthy.\nMaybe Jon Huntsman will do it, but he`s already so popular for\ntelling at least some of the truth, that he probably has nothing to lose.\nSCHULTZ: So far, I think Huntsman has been dry toast except when\nhe`s gone after the other candidates in recent days. That`s the only time\nhe`s gotten any pub at all.\nBob Shrum, always a pleasure. Great to have you with us.\nSHRUM: Great. Thanks, Ed.\nSCHULTZ: Next, one of Rick Perry`s cronies is shooting for a job in\nCongress. And the Perry charm is clear. His new campaign video compares\nwelfare recipients to donkeys.\nAnd Mitt Romney went on FOX and flip-flopped again. This time it was\nabout terrorism. He`s going in the zone.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nSCHULTZ: Welcome back to THE ED SHOW, and thanks for watching\ntonight. Here`s how the dance goes in Texas. They`re going to be getting\nfour more Congressional seats in 2012, which means we`ll have four more\nTexas Republican candidates to deal with. Like this dude, Roger Williams,\nfor example.\nThing guy was Rick Perry`s secretary of state for a few years. Now\nhe`s running his daddy`s car dealership and gunning for a seat in the\nCongress. Until recently, he seemed like a typical anti-government, tax\ncutting Texas Republican who thinks President Obama is a socialist.\nBut he`s kicking up the crazy a little bit, folks. The centerpiece of\nhis campaign is a video where he refers to himself as the \"Donkey\nWhisperer.` He claims the video is aimed at Democrats in general, but it\nsounds like he`s making fun of welfare recipients.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nROGER WILLIAMS (R), CANDIDATE FOR CONGRESS IN TEXAS: All these guys\nwant is they want more shelter. They want more feed. Yet the government`s\nmaking it harder on me. They`re taxing me to death. I can`t afford to\nbuild that.\nWhen I don`t build it, they think I owe it to them. All you guys want\n-- you want a handout. I don`t have something in it, and now you`re\ngetting mad again, OK.\nYears ago we, had didn`t have this problem. But now it`s just a\nhassle to get them to do anything. These donkeys don`t live in the United\nStates of France. They live in the United States of America.\nThey`re going to have to get with hit. They keep thinking that Obama\nis going to take care of them, that Obama is going to feed them, Obama`s\ngoing to build their barn.\nLook it, if I can get OBama out of health care -- will you accept that\n-- I can get these teeth fixed that you got, OK. I can get them fixed.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSCHULTZ: All geared towards low information voters. So Roger\nWilliams either thinks all Democrats are lazy and want a government\nhandout, or else he`s comparing welfare recipients to donkeys. I can see\nthe Rick Perry influence, can`t you? We better watch this guy.\nComing up, Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham have been quick to\ncriticize President Obama`s strategy on getting rid of Libyan Leader\nMoammar Gadhafi. But they met with the Libyan dictator just two years ago,\npledging their support. What happened?\nAnd Wisconsin`s recall summer is just the start for progressives.\nWill the White House take notice of what`s happening? John Nichols of \"The\nNation\" later in the show. Stay with us.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nSCHULTZ: Welcome back to THE ED SHOW. As Libyan dictator Moammar\nGadhafi`s reign seemed to be coming to an end, it was Senator John McCain\nand Senator Lindsey Graham offering criticism on President Obama. They\ncomplained it took the United States too long to employ the full weight of\nour nation`s air power.\nBut just 18 months before the United States` effort began, McCain and\nGraham and Senator Joe Lieberman were meeting with Gadhafi to off the\ndictator their support. In August of 2009, when Obama was in office, the\nthree senators met with Gadhafi as well as his son, who was Libya`s\nnational security adviser.\nAccording to documents released by Wikileaks, they offered to help\nGadhafi get C-130 transport aircraft and equipment needed for his own\nsecurity. Quoting from the document, \"Senators McCain and Graham conveyed\nthe United States` interest in continuing the progress of the bilateral\nrelationship and pledged to try to resolve the C-130 issue with Congress\nand Defense Secretary Gates.\"\nThey even gave Gadhafi advice on how to handle bad public relations as\na result of the Pan Am bombing coming home -- Pan Am bomber.\nLet`s bring in national affairs correspondent for \"Rolling Stone\nMagazine,\" Tim Dickinson. Tim, good to have you with us tonight. I\nappreciate your time now.\nThis criticism that these senators were laying on President Obama\ncomes after they were meeting with Moammar Gadhafi just months before.\nWhat do you make of that? What should we take from the story?\nTIM DICKINSON, \"THE ROLLING STONE\": Sure. All this has gone down the\nmemory hole. Gadhafi was our man in North Africa. The signature of\nsuccess, diplomatic success of the Bush administration was we hit Saddam\nand we scared Gadhafi straight. He had pledged to give up his weapons of\nmass destruction programs and rejoin the community of nations.\nAnd so the Bush policy and the Obama policy, up until the Arab spring,\nwas one of engagement, one of offering inducements and sweeteners to get\nGadhafi to live up to his commitments to give up his WMD and crackdown on\ninsurgents. We call the rebels today in Benghazi and eastern Libya.\nThis was part of that effort. So there`s plenty of hypocrisy to go\naround. But certainly the Three Amigos went off to Gadhafi`s ranch and had\na grand old time conveying what just you were saying, an offer of military\nsupport, perhaps some civilian nuclear support, in hopes of getting -- in\nhopes of sweetening the relationship.\nFar from standing up for American families who lost loved ones in the\nLockerbie Bombings, they were offering public relations advice to Gadhafi\non how to play it cool when the bomber came home, so that Americans\nwouldn`t get upset, and the relationship wouldn`t be jeopardized.\n(CROSS TALK)\nSCHULTZ: Let me ask you, what would motivate a United States senator\nto serve up PR advice to somebody like Moammar Gadhafi?\nDICKINSON: Again, this is somebody who had been our enemy, mortal\nenemy, and now is an important strategic ally in the region. He was\ncracking down on these insurgents in Eastern Libya, where a lot of people\nwere coming -- going from there into places like Afghanistan and Iraq, and\ninjuring our troops.\nThis was an important relationship. It`s gone down the memory hole,\nbut this all switched 180 degrees once we went to -- once the Arab spring\nwent into progress.\nLindsey Graham is almost sociopathic, though. Because it went from\nlet`s all meet with Gadhafi at his ranch to, hey, the world wouldn`t mind\nif we blew up Gadhafi, would they? Just this is really kind of bizarre.\nIt`s one thing to say, we think that we ought to be more aggressive,\nObama, in waging this war and going after Gadhafi once they`ve committed to\nit. But once it works out, once Tripoli seems to be falling without any\nreal bloodshed, to the kevetch (p) -- basically they said, thanks NATO,\nthanks to the brave Libyan people. We`re sorry the American president is\nsuch a pansy and wouldn`t break out the daisy cutters. It`s just sort of\ndeeply bitter partisanship. Makes you wonder what ever happened to country\nfirst.\nSCHULTZ: Let me get this in. Just five months ago, Senator Graham\ncriticized the Obama administration`s strategy for helping the rebels.\nHere it is.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: The strategy`s confusing to\nthe American people. Only 21 percent believe President Obama has a clear\nview of how to handle Libya. It`s demoralizing to our allies, particularly\npeople on the ground that we`re trying to help. I think it`s encouraging\nto our enemies.\nThis strategy is going to lead to a stalemate.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSCHULTZ: Where do they stand tonight?\nDICKINSON: They just want to criticize Obama for leading a successful\ncampaign, that was a minimum of American blood and treasure. It`s just\nsort of baffling to me that this -- you couldn`t just embrace this as a\ngood outcome, having disagreed with it at the beginning.\nSCHULTZ: Tim Dickinson, \"Rolling Stone Magazine,\" good to have you\nwith us tonight. Thanks so much. >\nDICKINSON: Thanks, Ed.\nSCHULTZ: Consistency is not one of Mitt Romney`s strengths. But this\ntime his flip-flopping went too far. Psycho Talk is next.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nSCHULTZ: As Americans along the East Coast prepare for a possible\nvisit from Hurricane Irene this weekend, residents of the Gulf Coast are\nstill dealing with impact of Hurricane Katrina six years later. Even as\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs broke ground earlier this month on a new\nmedical center in New Orleans to replace the one destroyed by Katrina,\nthere is still a desperate need for medical care in the city.\nNext Monday, August 29th, the National Association of Free Clinics,\nwith the help of THE ED SHOW and MSNBC will hold its third free clinic in\nNew Orleans. Your donations of time and money make these clinics a huge\nsuccess. To make a donation or to learn more about volunteer efforts or\nattending the New Orleans clinic, visit their website at FreeClinics.us.\nComing up, the Mittster says terrorists should be tried on U.S. soil,\nbut only the pre-9/11 ones. He`s going in the Zone. Stay with us.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nSCHULTZ: And in Psycho Talk tonight, Mitt Romney`s flip-flopping\nstreak, well, it continues. The Mittster has changed his position on\neverything from health care to the NRA. Now he`s changing his tune about\nwhether terrorists should be tried on U.S. soil.\nThe last time he ran for president, he had this to say about trying\nterrorists.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nMITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I`m glad they`re at\nGuantanamo. I don`t want them on our soil. I want them at Guantanamo,\nwhere they don`t get the access to lawyers they get when they`re on our\nsoil. I don`t want them in our prisons. I went them there.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSCHULTZ: Pretty clear position, isn`t it? And he doubled down on it\nearlier this year when he called President Obama inexperienced and naive\nfor wanting to try terrorists in the United States. But this week, Romney\nsang a different tune when he was asked about the Lockerbie Bomber, who has\nbeen hiding out in Libya.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nNEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: If indeed Gadhafi goes down, do you\nthink the new government should over Magrahi to whom?\nROMNEY: Well, the United States of America would be my first choice.\nWe would try him here and see that justice is done. This is a person\nresponsible for the lives of hundreds of people.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSCHULTZ: So in 2007, Romney didn`t want terrorists on U.S. soil. But\nnow the U.S. is the first choice to try a terrorist who blew up an airplane\nkilling hundreds of people. Romney tried to weasel out of his flip-flop\nwith the following statement: \"a pre-9/11 terrorist who was not associated\nwith al Qaeda cannot be detained at Guantanamo or tried by our military\ncommissions. Should the law change and allow other forms to be used,\nGovernor Romney would explore those options as well.\"\nPretty weak stuff, don`t you think, for a guy who wants to be\npresident of the United States? The bottom line is, if the American\njustice system is strong enough to try a Lockerbie bomber, then it is\nstrong enough to try the terrorists being held in Gitmo, don`t you think.\nAnd for the Mittster to support a terror trial on U.S. soil after\nsaying President Obama was naive for wanting to do the same thing is pretty\nsleazy Psycho Talk.\nDemocrats all across the country running on economic issues and\nworkers` rights. You know what? They`re winning. John Nichols explains\nwhy President Obama needs to adopt the same strategy.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nSCHULTZ: Libya in turmoil, a hurricane targeting and bearing down on\nthe east coast. Fortunately, with all that`s going on in the world, the\ngang at \"Fox & Friends,\" they found time for this.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you want to win the 2012 race you need one\nthing. Here it is, great hair.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSCHULTZ: The scientific data is undeniable. The guy with the best\nhair wins. Guest Peter Funt providing the analysis.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Obama versus McCain.\nPETER FUNT, WRITER AND TV HOST: Well, you know, that was a bit of\nhistory being made, as we all know. 2008, the first time Americans elected\nan African-American haircut.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSCHULTZ: But McCain is old news. Fortunately, the current crop of\nRepublican candidates, as Bush might say, they`re not folically challenged.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have two guys in the GOP, I mean, with\nserious beautiful hair, Rick Perry and Mitt Romney.\nFUNT: Well, I mean --\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You cannot get -- it`s Superman hair is what it\nis.\nFUNT: No kidding.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSCHULTZ: Will Rick Perry`s Superman hair prove to be Obama`s\nKryptonite?\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nFUNT: If it comes down to health care versus hair care, gosh, Obama\ncould be in trouble, huh?\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: That was hilarious.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: That was very good. I thought so.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Coming up, I said hair-larious.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Didn`t you? Never mind.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nSCHULTZ: How in the world do you top that.\nYou know what, Donald Trump, you have to get back in this race. All\nthe scientific evidence is right there with you, dude. John Nichols of\n\"The Nation\" will try to top all of that. He joins me next. Stay with us.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nSCHULTZ: It`s been one hell of a summer for progressives all across\nthis country. And while President Obama and Congressional Democrats\ndisappointed folks over the debt ceiling debacle, it`s not all bad news.\nIn fact, outside of Washington, D.C., it`s quite the opposite.\nPeople are fed up with Republican overreach. That`s plain and simply\nbeing told to those on the campaign trail. Last year`s midterm elections\nushered in governors like Walker and Kasich, governors who started slashing\nservices and really went after collective bargaining rights the moment they\ncould.\nThose Republicans are now experiencing the backlash from the recalls\nin Wisconsin to the special elections in Maine. Progressives have been\nfighting back and they are winning, winning on economic issues and winning\nin rural areas, places where Democrats experienced big losses in the last\nelection cycle.\nIf this kind of momentum keeps up, well, it could mean big\nimplications in the 2012 election. President Obama, are you listening? I\nthink he is.\nTime now for John Nichols to check in with us tonight, Washington\ncorrespondent of \"The Nation Magazine.\" John, good to have you with us.\nI want to focus in first on Wisconsin, if I may, because Governor\nWalker made an interesting comment the other day that not many people\npicked up on. He was talking about the recall effort. He said that we\nkeep hearing from the White House that they`re not for it.\nDid I hear that correctly? And what in the hell is he talking about?\nDoes that mean that he`s hearing from the White House that President Obama\nand his team don`t want to see a radical governor get recalled? Take us\ndown that road. What`s the story?\nJOHN NICOLS, \"THE NATION\": Sure. Look, the first thing is I can\nassure you that the Obama White House is not in regular conversation with\nthe Scott Walker state house. And so that`s the governor doing what he has\na tendency to do, which is sort of take the partisan spin and add a little\nbit of his own salsa to it.\nSCHULTZ: He says we keep hearing from the White House that they`re\nnot for the recall. That`s a pretty clear statement that there`s been some\ncommunication.\nNICHOLS: I don`t buy it. I think that it is again the governor\nplaying games politically. But I can tell you this: there is a lot of\ninternal debate in Wisconsin about when and how to do a recall of Scott\nWalker. Remember, no matter what you`ve heard from all the national spin\nand the spin of the Walker supporters, the reality is that Governor\nWalker`s approval rating is dramatically lower than that of President\nObama.\nHe is down in the mid-30s. And so Governor Walker`s got a real\nproblem. If there is a recall, he`s very, very vulnerable. The question\nis, do you go immediately or later?\nSCHULTZ: I see a sea change taking place. I sense it out there when\nwe go back to the Midwest quite often. You have been out and about. What\nI laid out before I brought you in on this interview is in your work in\n\"The Nation Magazine.\" What have you seen? What are you hearing? What\nare you feeling on the ground?\nNICHOLS: It`s pretty remarkable, Ed. I think this is one of those\nstories that an awful lot of the national media that doesn`t pay attention\nto the states is missing. I even think some of the political class in\nWashington is missing this.\nBut across the country, not just in Wisconsin, but in New Hampshire,\nin Maine, in other states across the country where there have been special\nelections and, of course, the recall elections in Wisconsin, where\nDemocrats have been in the field, running often in very Republican leaning\ndistricts, but running on economic populous messages, challenging the\nattacks on labor, supporting public education, supporting local services,\nsaying that billionaires and big corporations ought to pay their fair share\nof taxes.\nWhen that message has been put out, Democrats aren`t just winning.\nThey`re winning by dramatically improved margins. In fact, what I found\nacross the country as I looked at these special elections and recalls is a\nnumber of places where Democrats not only improved on their 2010 numbers,\nwhich they needed to. They have to do better than 2010. There were cases\nwhere Democrats were improving on 2008 numbers. They were doing better\nthan in the Obama landslide.\nSCHULTZ: What makes you think that this momentum is going to last\nmore than a year. Here we are in August of `11. We got quite a ways to go\nbefore November of `12. Obviously, there will be a big turnout for the\ngeneral.\nBut what makes you think -- I guess I see the Republicans doing\nnothing on jobs, so I don`t think the economy`s going to get a heck of a\nlot better. These cuts by these radical governors, we have to keep this in\nthe news, because I think this is what people are really concerned about.\nI think that Perry out there would be the perfect candidate for President\nObama to go up against, because of the things that he has done in Texas,\nbecause they pretty much emulate what the Republican philosophy is all\nabout.\nCan this momentum on the lift with progressives maintain for that\nlong?\nNICHOLS: It`s a choice that the president and national Democrats have\nto make. When I talked to state-based and local Democrats across the\ncountry, I asked them that exact question. They said, look, these issues\naren`t going to go away. Unemployment, unfortunately, is not going to go\naway as an issue in 2012.\nAnd neither are these concerns about local schools, about public\neducation, public services, about whether we`re going to have a middle\nclass. But it is how these fights and these issues are articulated. The\npresident and national Democrats need to learn the language of Wisconsin\nand Ohio and Maine, where Democrats are taking economic populist messages\ninto the field and winning.\nSCHULTZ: We`re going to Ohio with THE ED SHOW. And I`m looking\nforward to it, because Senate Bill 5 is really part of everything we have\nbeen talking about. And they want to, of course, recall it. And they have\nover 1.3 million signatures to get it on the ballot.\nIt`s going to be a heck of a story next month and in the following\nmonths up to the November election. I want to talk about former Vice\nPresident Dick Cheney. He is out today with an exclusive interview with\nNBC`s Jamie Gangel, says that his book will have heads exploding in\nWashington.\nWhat is he -- what can we anticipate that he`s going to reveal that`s\ngoing to make our heads explode, if we`re in the nation`s capitol?\nNICHOLS: Well, look, you know, the one thing to remember is that\neveryone`s out of Washington for the break, for the recess. So my sense is\nthe only thing that would actually make anybody in Washington surprised\ncoming from Dick Cheney would be the truth, because he very rarely goes\nnear it.\nThe fact of the matter is that Vice President Cheney -- former Vice\nPresident Cheney is trying to sell a book. So he`s saying, this is going\nto have all --\nSCHULTZ: Even after all the money he made with Halliburton? Even\nafter all the millions he`s got? He`s still concerned about selling a\nbook? I find that interesting.\nNICHOLS: It`s a funny thing about wealthy people. They like to get\nwealthier. The one thing to remember about Dick Cheney is that he is\ndesperate to remain in the limelight. He`s not just trying to sell this\nbook to make money. He`s using this book as a vehicle to, you know, get\nthat prime time slot at the 2012 Republican convention and get the standing\novation that he lives for. He is a politician after all.\nSCHULTZ: John Nichols of \"The Nation Magazine,\" always great to have\nyou with us. Thanks so much. Is there a sea change taking place across\nAmerica? I think so.\nTonight in our survey, I asked you, are school children suffering\nbecause of Republican priorities like tax breaks for the rich, Ninety five\npercent of you said yes; five percent of you said no.\nThat`s THE ED SHOW.

Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts.

I’m Dr. Charles Boustany, and I’m proud to serve the people of Louisiana’s Seventh Congressional District. I’m also a heart surgeon with more than 20 years of experience, during which I saw first-hand the need for lowering health care costs. Republicans are pleased that President Obama came to the Capitol tonight. We agree much needs to be done to lower the cost of health care for all Americans. On that goal, Republicans are ready – and we’ve been ready – to work with the president for common-sense reforms that our nation can afford. Afford is an important word. Our country is facing many challenges. The cost of health care is rising. Federal spending is soaring. We’re piling huge debt on our children. And families and small businesses are struggling through a jobless recovery, with more than 2.4 million private-sector jobs lost since February. It’s clear the American people want health care reform, but they want their elected leaders to get it right. Most Americans wanted to hear the president tell Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Reid and the rest of Congress that it’s time to start over on a common-sense, bipartisan plan focused on lowering the cost of health care while improving quality. That’s what I heard over the past several months in talking to thousands of my constituents. Replacing your family’s current health care with government-run health care is not the answer. In fact, it’ll make health care much more expensive. That’s not just my personal diagnosis as a doctor or a Republican; it’s the conclusion of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office – the neutral scorekeeper that determines the cost of major bills. I read the bill Democrats passed through committee in July. It creates 53 new government bureaucracies, adds hundreds of billions to our national debt, and raises taxes on job-creators by $600 billion. And, it cuts Medicare by $500 billion, while doing virtually nothing to make the program better for our seniors. The president had a chance tonight to take government-run health care off the table. Unfortunately, he didn’t do it. We can do better, with a targeted approach that tackles the biggest problems. Here are four important areas where we can agree, right now: One, all individuals should have access to coverage, regardless of preexisting conditions. Two, individuals, small businesses and other groups should be able to join together to get health insurance at lower prices, the same way large businesses and labor unions do. Three, we can provide assistance to those who still cannot access a doctor. And, four, insurers should be able to offer incentives for wellness care and prevention – something particularly important to me. I operated on too many people who could have avoided surgery if they’d simply made healthier choices earlier in life. We do have ideas the president hasn’t agreed with. We’re grateful the president mentioned medical liability reform, and we hope he’s serious. We need to establish tough liability reform standards, encourage speedy resolution of claims, and deter junk lawsuits that drive up the cost of care. Real reform must do this. Let’s also talk about letting families and businesses buy insurance across state lines. I and many other Republicans believe that that will provide real choice and competition to lower the cost of health insurance. Unfortunately, the president disagrees. You can read more about all these reforms at healthcare.gop.gov. These are common-sense reforms we can achieve right away – without destroying jobs, exploding the deficit, rationing care, or taking away the freedom American families cherish. This Congress can pass meaningful reform soon to reduce some of the fear and anxiety families are feeling in these very difficult times. Working together in a bipartisan way, we can truly lower the cost of health care while improving quality for the American people. I’m Dr. Charles Boustany. Thanks for listening.

Roosevelt signed 121 bills. Among these bills was a landmark law in the Nation's social and economic development -- Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA). Against a history of judicial opposition, the depression-born FLSA had survived, not unscathed, more than a year of Congressional altercation. In its final form, the act applied to industries whose combined employment represented only about one-fifth of the labor force. In these industries, it banned oppressive child labor and set the minimum hourly wage at 25 cents, and the maximum workweek at 44 hours.1\nForty years later, a distinguished news commentator asked incredulously: \"My God! 25 cents an hour! Why all the fuss?\" President Roosevelt expressed a similar sentiment in a \"fireside chat\" the night before the signing. He warned: \"Do not let any calamity-howling executive with an income of $1,000 a day, ...tell you...that a wage of $11 a week is going to have a disastrous effect on all American industry.\"2 In light of the social legislation of 1978, Americans today may be astonished that a law with such moderate standards could have been thought so revolutionary.\nCourting disaster\nThe Supreme Court had been one of the major obstacles to wage-hour and child-labor laws. Among notable cases is the 1918 case of Hammer v. Dagenhart in which the Court by one vote held unconstitutional a Federal child-labor law. Similarly in Adkins v. Children's Hospital in 1923, the Court by a narrow margin voided the District of Columbia law that set minimum wages for women. During the 1930's, the Court's action on social legislation was even more devastating.3\nNew Deal promise. In 1933, under the \"New Deal\" program, Roosevelt's advisers developed a National Industrial Recovery Act (NRA).4 The act suspended antitrust laws so that industries could enforce fair-trade codes resulting in less competition and higher wages. On signing the bill, the President stated: \"History will probably record the National Industrial Recovery Act as the most important and far-reaching legislation ever enacted by the American Congress.\" The law was popular, and one family in Darby, Penn., christened a newborn daughter Nira to honor it.5\nAs an early step of the NRA, Roosevelt promulgated a President's Reemployment Agreement \"to raise wages, create employment, and thus restore business.\" Employers signed more than 2.3 million agreements, covering 16.3 million employees. Signers agreed to a workweek between 35 and 40 hours and a minimum wage of $12 to $15 a week and undertook, with some exceptions, not to employ youths under 16 years of age. Employers who signed the agreement displayed a \"badge of honor,\" a blue eagle over the motto \"We do our part.\" Patriotic Americans were expected to buy only from \"Blue Eagle\" business concerns.6\nIn the meantime, various industries developed more complete codes. The Cotton Textile Code was the first of these and one of the most important. It provided for a 40-hour workweek, set a minimum weekly wage of $13 in the North and $12 in the South, and abolished child labor. The President said this code made him \"happier than any other one thing...since I have come to Washington, for the code abolished child labor in the textile industry.\" He added: \"After years of fruitless effort and discussion, this ancient atrocity went out in a day.\"7\nA crushing blow. On \"Black Monday,\" May 27, 1935, the Supreme Court disarmed the NRA as the major depression-fighting weapon of the New Deal. The 1935 case of Schechter Corp. v. United States tested the constitutionality of the NRA by questioning a code to improve the sordid conditions under which chickens were slaughtered and sold to retail kosher butchers.8 All nine justices agreed that the act was an unconstitutional delegation of government power to private interests. Even the liberal Benjamin Cardozo thought it was \"delegation running riot.\" Though the \"sick chicken\" decision seems an absurd case upon which to decide the fate of so sweeping a policy, it invalidated not only the restrictive trade practices set by the NRA-authorized codes, but the codes' progressive labor provisions as well.9\nAs if to head off further attempts at labor reform, the Supreme Court, in a series of decisions, invalidated both State and Federal labor laws. Most notorious was the 1936 case of Joseph Tipaldo.10The manager of a Brooklyn, N.Y., laundry, Tipaldo had been paying nine laundry women only $10 a week, in violation of the New York State minimum wage law. When forced to pay his workers $14.88, Tipaldo coerced them to kick back the difference. When Tipaldo was jailed on charges of violating the State law, forgery, and conspiracy, his lawyers sought a writ of habeas corpus on grounds the New York law was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court, by a 5-to-4 majority voided the law as a violation of liberty of contract.11\nThe Tipaldo decision was among the most unpopular ever rendered by the Supreme Court. Even bitter foes of President Roosevelt and the New Deal criticized the Court. Ex-President Herbert Hoover said the Court had gone to extremes. Conservative Republican Congressman Hamilton Fish called it a \"new Dred Scott decision\" condemning 3 million women and children to economic slavery.12\nA switch in time. Wage-hour legislation was a campaign issue in the 1936 Presidential race. The Democratic platform called for higher labor standards, and, in his campaign, Roosevelt promised to seek some constitutional way of protecting workers. He tried to pave the way for such legislation in his speeches and new conferences in which he spoke of the breakdown of child labor provisions, minimum wages, and maximum hour standards after the demise of the NRA codes.\nWhen Roosevelt won the 1936 election by 523 electoral votes to 8, he interpreted his landslide victory as support for the New Deal and was determined to overcome the obstacle of Supreme Court opposition as soon as possible. In February 1937, he struck back at the \"nine old men\" of the Bench: He proposed to \"pack\" the Court by adding up to six extra judges, one for each judge who did not retire at age 70. Roosevelt further voiced his disappointment with the Court at the victory dinner for his second inauguration, saying if the \"three-horse team [of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches] pulls as one, the field will be ploughed,\" but that the field will not be ploughed if one horse lies down in the traces or plunges off in another direction.\"13\nHowever, Roosevelt's metaphorical maverick fell in step. On \"White Monday,\" March 29, 1937, the Court reversed its course when it decided the case of West Coast Hotel Company v. Parrish.14 Elsie Parrish, a former chambermaid at the Cascadian Hotel in Wenatchee, Wash., sued for $216.19 in back wages, charging that the hotel had paid her less than the State minimum wage. In an unexpected turn-around, Justice Owen Roberts voted with the four-man liberal minority to uphold the Washington minimum wage law.\nAs other close decisions continued to validate social and economic legislation, support for Roosevelt's Court \"reorganization\" faded. Meanwhile, Justice Roberts felt called upon to deny that he had switched sides to ward off Roosevelt's court-packing plan. He claimed valid legal distinctions between the Tipaldo case and the Parrish case. Nevertheless, many historians subscribe to the contemporary view of Robert's vote, that \"a switch in time saved nine.\"15\nA young worker's plea\nWhile President Franklin Roosevelt was in Bedford, Mass., campaigning for reelection, a young girl tried to pass him an envelope. But a policeman threw her back into the crowd. Roosevelt told an aide, \"Get the note from the girl.\" Her note read,\nI wish you could do something to help us girls....We have been working in a sewing factory,... and up to a few months ago we were getting our minimum pay of $11 a week... Today the 200 of us girls have been cut down to $4 and $5 and $6 a week.\nTo a reporter's question, the President replied, \"Something has to be done about the elimination of child labor and long hours and starvation wages.\"\n-FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT Public Papers and Addresses, Vol. V New York, Random House, 1936), pp. 624-25.\nBack to the drawing board\nJustice Roberts' \"Big Switch\" is an important event in American legal history. It is also a turning point in American social history, for it marked a new legal attitude toward labor standards. To be sure, validating a single State law was a far cry from upholding general Federal legislation, but the Parrish decision encouraged advocates of fair labor standards to work all the harder to develop a bill that might be upheld by the Supreme Court.\nAn ardent advocate. No top government official worked more ardently to develop legislation to help underpaid workers and exploited child laborers than Secretary Frances Perkins. Almost all her working life, Perkins fought for pro-labor legislation. To avoid the sometime pitfall of judicial review, she consulted legal experts in forming legislation. Her autobiographical account of her relations with President Roosevelt is filled with the names of lawyers with whom she discussed legislation: Felix Frankfurter, Thomas Corcoran, Gerard Reilly, Benjamin Cohen, Charles Wyzanski, and many others both within and outside Government.\nWhen, in 1933, President Roosevelt asked Frances Perkins to become Secretary of Labor, she told him that she would accept if she could advocate a law to put a floor under wages and a ceiling over hours of work and to abolish abuses of child labor. When Roosevelt heartily agreed, Perkins asked him, \"Have you considered that to launch such a program... might be considered unconstitutional?\" Roosevelt retorted, \"Well, we can work out something when the time comes.\"16\nDuring the constitutional crisis over the NRA, Secretary Perkins asked lawyers at the Department of Labor to draw up two wage-hour and child-labor bills which might survive Supreme Court review. She then told Roosevelt, \"I have something up my sleeve....I've got two bills ...locked in the lower left-hand drawer of my desk against an emergency.\" Roosevelt laughed and said, \"There's New England caution for you.... You're pretty unconstitutional, aren't you?\"17\nEarlier Government groundwork. One of the bills that Perkins had \"locked\" in the bottom drawer of her desk was used before the 1937 \"Big Switch.\" The bill proposed using the purchasing power of the Government as an instrument for improving labor standards. Under the bill Government contractors would have to agree to pay the \"prevailing wage\" and meet other labor standards. The idea had been tried in World War I to woo worker support for the war. Then, President Hoover reincarnated the \"prevailing wage\" and fair standards criteria as conditions for bidding for the construction of public buildings. This act -- the Davis-Bacon Act -- in expanded form stands as a bulwark of labor standards in the construction industry.\nRoosevelt and Perkins tried to make model employers of government contractors in all fields, not just construction. They were dismayed to find that, except in public construction, the Federal Government actually encouraged employers to exploit labor because the Government had to award every contract to the lowest bidder. In 1935, approximately 40 percent of government contractors, employing 1.5 million workers, cut wages below and stretched hours above the standards developed under the NRA.\nThe Roosevelt-Perkins remedial initiative resulted in the Public Contracts Act of 1936 (Walsh-Healey). The act required most government contractors to adopt an 8-hour day and a 40-hour week, to employ only those over 16 years of age if they were boys or 18 years of age if they were girls, and to pay a \"prevailing minimum wage\" to be determined by the Secretary of Labor. The bill had been hotly contested and much diluted before it passed Congress on June 30, 1936. Though limited to government supply contracts and weakened by amendments and court interpretations, the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act was hailed as a token of good faith by the Federal Government -- that it intended to lead the way to better pay and working conditions.18\nA broader bill is born\nPresident Roosevelt had postponed action on a fair labor standards law because of his fight to \"pack\" the Court. After the \"switch in time,\" when he felt the time was ripe, he asked Frances Perkins, \"What happened to that nice unconstitutional bill you tucked away?\"\nThe bill -- the second that Perkins had \"tucked\" away -- was a general fair labor standards act. To cope with the danger of judicial review, Perkins' lawyers had taken several constitutional approaches so that, if one or two legal principles were invalidated, the bill might still be accepted. The bill provided for minimum-wage boards which would determine, after public hearing and consideration of cost-of-living figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, whether wages in particular industries were below subsistence levels.\nPerkins sent her draft to the White House where Thomas Corcoran and Benjamin Cohen, two trusted legal advisers of the President, with the Supreme Court in mind, added new provisions to the already lengthy measure. \"Ben Cohen and I worked on the bill and the political effort behind it for nearly 4 years with Senator Black and Sidney Hillman,\" Corcoran noted.19\nAn early form of the bill being readied for Congress affected only wages and hours. To that version Roosevelt added a child-labor provision based on the political judgment that adding a clause banning goods in interstate commerce produced by children under 16 years of age would increase the chance of getting a wage-hour measure through both Houses, because child-labor limitations were popular in Congress.20\nCongress-round I\nOn May 24, 1937, President Roosevelt sent the bill to Congress with a message that America should be able to give \"all our able-bodied working men and women a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.\" He continued: \"A self-supporting and self-respecting democracy can plead no justification for the existence of child labor, no economic reason for chiseling worker's wages or stretching workers' hours.\" Though States had the right to set standards within their own borders, he said, goods produced under \"conditions that do not meet rudimentary standards of decency should be regarded as contraband and ought not to be allowed to pollute the channels of interstate trade.\" He asked Congress to pass applicable legislation\"at this session.\"21\nSenator Hugo Black of Alabama, a champion of a 30-hour workweek, agreed to sponsor the Administration bill on this subject in the Senate, while Representative William P. Connery of Massachusetts introduced corresponding legislation in the House. The Black-Connery bill had wide Public support, and its path seemed smoothed by arrangements for a joint hearing by the labor committees of both Houses.\nGenerally, the bill provided for a 40-cent-an-hour minimum wage, a 40-hour maximum workweek, and a minimum working age of 16 except in certain industries outside of mining and manufacturing. The bill also proposed a five-member labor standards board which could authorize still higher wages and shorter hours after review of certain cases.\nProponents of the bill stressed the need to fulfill the President's promise to correct conditions under which \"one-third of the population\" were \"ill-nourished, ill-clad, and ill- housed.\" They pointed out that, in industries which produced products for interstate commerce, the bill would end oppressive child labor and \"unnecessarily long hours which wear out part of the working population while they keep the rest from having work to do.\" Shortening hours, they argued, would \"create new jobs...for millions of our unskilled unemployed,\" and minimum wages would \"underpin the whole wage structure...at a point from which collective bargaining could take over.\"22\nAdvocates of higher labor standards described the conditions of sweated labor. For example, a survey by the Labor Department's Children's Bureau of a cross section of 449 children in several States showed nearly one-fourth of them working 60 hours or longer a week and only one-third working 40 hours or less a week. The median wage was slightly over $4 a week.23\nOne advocate, Commissioner of Labor Statistics Isador Lubin, explained to the joint Senate-House committee that during depressions the ability to overwork employees, rather than efficiency, determined business success. The economy, he reported, had deteriorated to the chaotic stage where employers with high standards were forced by cut-throat competition to exploit labor in order to survive. \"The outstanding feature of the proposed legislation,\" Lubin said, is that \"it aims to establish by law a plane of competition far above that which could be maintained in the absence of government edict.\"24\nOpponents of the bill charged that, although the President might damn them as \"economic royalists and sweaters of labor,\" the Black-Connery bill was \"a bad bill badly drawn\" which would lead the country to a \"tyrannical industrial dictatorship.\" They said New Deal rhetoric, like \"the smoke screen of the cuttle fish,\" diverted attention from what amounted to socialist planning. Prosperity, they insisted, depended on the \"genius\" of American business, but how could business \"find any time left to provide jobs if we are to persist in loading upon it these everlastingly multiplying governmental mandates and delivering it to the mercies of multiplying and hampering Federal bureaucracy?\"25\nOrganized labor supported the bill but was split on how strong it should be. Some leaders, such as Sidney Hillman of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union and David Dubinsky of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, supported a strong bill. In fact, when Southern congressmen asked for the setting of lower pay for their region, Dubinsky's union suggested lower pay for Southern congressmen. But William Green of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and John L. Lewis of the Congress of Industrial Organization (CIO), on one of the rare occasions when they agreed, both favored a bill which would limit labor standards to low-paid and essentially unorganized workers. Based on some past experiences, many union leaders feared that a minimum wage might become a maximum and that wage boards would intervene in areas which they wanted reserved for labor-management negotiations. They were satisfied when the bill was amended to exclude work covered by collective bargaining.\nThe weakened bill passed the Senate July 31, 1937, by a vote of 56 to 28 and would have easily passed the House if it had been put to a vote. But a coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats bottled it up in the House Rules Committee. After a long hot summer, Congress adjourned without House action on fair labor standards.26\nCongress-round II\nAn angry President Roosevelt decided to press again for passage of the Black-Connery bill. Having lost popularity and split the Democratic Party in his battle to \"pack\" the Supreme Court, Roosevelt felt that attacking abuses of child labor and sweatshop wages and hours was a popular cause that might reunite the party. A wage-hour, child-labor law promised to be a happy marriage of high idealism and practical politics.\nOn October 12, 1937, Roosevelt called a special session of Congress to convene on November 15. The public interest, he said, required immediate Congressional action: \"The exploitation of child labor and the undercutting of wages and the stretching of the hours of the poorest paid workers in periods of business recession has a serious effect on buying power\".27\nDespite White House and business pressure, the conservative alliance of Republicans and Southern Democrats that controlled the House Rules Committee refused to discharge the bill as it stood. Congresswoman Mary Norton of New Jersey, now chairing the House Labor Committee, made a valiant attempt to shake the bill loose\".28 Many representatives had told her that they agreed with the principles of the bill but that they objected to a five-man wage board with broad powers. Therefore, Norton told the House of Representatives that the Labor Committee would offer an amendment to change the administration of the bill from a five-man board to an administrator under the Department of Labor. Urging representatives to sign a petition to jar the bill out of committee, Norton appealed:\nI now hope and urge that these Members will keep faith with me, as I have kept faith with them, and sign the petition . . . we are approaching Thanksgiving Day, . . . I do not see how any Member of this House can enjoy his Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow if he fails to put his name to that petition this afternoon.\nThough Norton missed her Thanksgiving Day dead-line, by December 2, the bill's supporters had rounded up enough signers to give the petition the 218 signatures necessary to bring the bill to a vote on the House floor.29\nWith victory within grasp, the bill became a battle-ground in the war raging between the AFL and the CIO. The AFL accused the Roosevelt Administration of favoring industrial over craft unions and opposed wage-board determination of labor standards for specific industries. Accordingly, the AFL fought for a substitute bill with a flat 40-cent-an-hour minimum wage and a maximum 40-hour week.\nIn the ensuing confusion, shortly, before the Christmas holiday of 1937, the House by a vote of 218 to 198 unexpectedly sent the bill back to the Labor Committee.30 In her memoir of President Roosevelt, Frances Perkins wrote:\nThis was the first time that a major administration bill had been defeated on the floor of the House. The press took the view that this was the death knell of wage-hour legislation as well as a decisive blow to the President's prestige.31\nRoosevelt tries again\nAgain, Roosevelt returned to the fray. In his annual message to Congress on January 3, 1938, he said he was seeking \"legislation to end starvation wages and intolerable hours.\" He paid deference to the South by saying that \"no reasonable person seeks a complete uniformity in wages.\" He also made peace overtures to business by pointing out that he was forgoing \"drastic\" change, and he appeased organized labor, saying that \"more desirable wages are and should continue to be the product of collective bargaining.\"32\nThe day following Roosevelt's message, Representative Lister Hill, a strong Roosevelt supporter, won an Alabama election primary for the Senate by an almost 2-to-1 majority over an anti-New Deal congressman. The victory was significant because much of the opposition to wage-hour laws came from Southern congressmen. In February, a national public opinion poll showed that 67 percent of the populace favored the wage-hour law, with even the South showing a substantial plurality of support for higher standards.33\nReworking the bill. In the meantime, Department of Labor lawyers worked on a new bill. Privately, Roosevelt had told Perkins that the length and complexity of the bill caused some of its difficulties. \"Can't it be boiled down to two pages?\" he asked. Lawyers trying to simplify the bill faced the problem that, although legal language makes legislation difficult to understand, bills written in simple English are often difficult for the courts to enforce. And because the wage-hour, child-labor bill had been drafted with the Supreme Court in mind, Solicitor Labor Gerard Reilly could not meet the President's two-page goal; however, he succeeded in cutting the bill from 40 to 10 pages.\nIn late January 1938, Reilly and Perkins brought the revision to President Roosevelt. He approved it, and the new bill went to Congress.34\nRoosevelt and Perkins prepared for rugged opposition. Roosevelt put pressure on Congressmen who had ridden his coattails to election victory in 1936 and who then knifed New Deal legislation. Perkins added to her staff Rufus Pole, a young lawyer, to follow the bill through Congress. Pole worked resourcefully pinpointed the issues that bothered some Congressmen, and identified a large number of Senators and Representatives who could be counted on to vote favorably.\nNorton appointed Representative Robert Ramspeck of Georgia to head a subcommittee to bridge the gap between various proposals. The subcommittee's efforts resulted in the Ramspeck compromise which Perkins felt \"contained the bare essentials she could support.\"35 The compromise retained the 40-cent minimum hourly wage and the 40-hour maximum workweek. It did not provide for an administrator as had the previous bill which had been voted back to the committee by the House. Instead, the compromise allowed for a five-member wage board which would be less powerful than those proposed by the Black-Connery bill.\nCongress-the final round\nThe House Labor Committee voted down the Ramspeck compromise, but, by a 10-to-4 vote, approved an even more \"barebones\" bill presented by Norton. Her bill following the AFL proposal, provided for a 40-cent hourly minimum wage, replaced the wage boards proposed by the Ramspeck compromise with an administrator and advising commission, and allowed for procedures for investigation into certain cases.36\nA message from the voters. Again, the House Rules Committee (under Rep. John J. O'Conner of New York, whom Roosevelt called an \"obstructionist\" who \"pickled\" New Deal programs) prevented discussion of the bill on the House floor by a vote of 8 to 6.37 The President then put his prestige on the line. On April 30, 1938, for the sixth time since taking office, he communicated with Congress over wages and hours through a letter to Mrs. Norton. He said he had no right whatsoever as President to criticize the rules but suggested as an ex-legislator and as a friend that \"the whole membership of the legislative body should be given full and free opportunity to discuss [exceptional measures] which are of undoubted national importance because they relate to major policies of Government and affect the lives of millions of people.\" He avoided judgement of the bill but noted that the Rules Committee, by a narrow vote, had prevented 435 members from \"discussing, amending, recommitting, defeating or passing some kind of a bill.\" He concluded: \"I still hope that the House as a whole can vote on a wage and hour bill. ...I hope that the democratic processes of legislation will continue.\"38\nThree days later, May 3, 1938, Congressman Claude Pepper won a resounding victory over anti-New Dealer J. Mark Wilcox in the Florida Senate primary. Wilcox had made New Deal programs the major issue and had labeled Pepper \"Roosevelt rubber stamp.\"\nNothing impresses Congressmen more than election returns. The January and May victories of New Deal advocated in the South brought home to Southern Congressmen the message of how their constituents felt about fair labor standards. A petition to discharge the bill from the Rules Committee was placed on the desk of the Speaker of the House on May 6, at 12 noon. In 2 hours and 20 minutes, 218 members has signed it, and additional members were waiting in the aisles.39\nBraving the floor battle. Proponents of the wage-hour, child-labor bill pressed the attack. They continued to point to \"horror stories.\" One Congressman quoted a magazine article entitled \"All Work and No Pay\" which told how, in a company that paid wages in scrip for use in the company store, pay envelopes contained nothing for a full week's work after the deduction of store charges.\nThe most bitter controversy raged over labor standards in the South. \"There are in the State of Georgia,\" one Indiana Congressman declaimed, \"canning factories working ... women 10 hours a day for $4.50 a week. Can the canning factories of Indiana and Connecticut of New York continue to exist and meet such competitive labor costs?\"40 Southern Congressmen, in turn, challenged the Northern \"monopolists\" who hypocritically \"loll on their tongues\" words like \"slave labor\" and \"sweat-shops\" and support bills which sentence Southern industry to death. Some Southern employers told the Department of Labor that they could not live with a 25-cent-an-hour minimum wage. They would have to fire all their people, they said. Adapting a biblical quotation, Representative John McClellan of Arkansas rhetorically asked, \"What profiteth the laborer of the South if he gain the enactment of a wage and hour law -- 40 cents per hour and 40 hours per week -- if he then lose the opportunity to work?\"41\nPartly because of Southern protests, provisions of the act were altered so that the minimum wage was reduced to 25 cents an hour for the first year of the act. Southerners gained additional concessions, such as a requirement that wage administrators consider lower costs of living and higher freight rates in the South before recommending wages above the minimum.\nThough the revised bill had reduced substantially the administrative machinery provided for in earlier drafts, several Congressmen singled out Secretary Perkins for personal attack. One Perkins detractor noted that, although Congress had \"overwhelmingly rebelled\" against delegation of power,\nWe delegate to Madam Perkins the authority and power to 'issue an order declaring such industry to be an industry affecting commerce.' Now section 9 is ...one of the 'snooping' sections of the bill. Imagine the feeling of the merchant or the industry up in your district when a 'designated representative'...of Mme. Perkins' enter and inspect such places and such records'...I know no previous law going quite so far.42\nA resulting compromise modified the authority of the administrator in the Department of Labor.\nThe bill was voted upon May 24, 1938, with a 314-to-97 majority. After the House had passed the bill, the Senate-House Conference Committee made still more changes to reconcile differences. During the legislative battles over fair labor standards, members of Congress had proposed 72 amendments. Almost every change sought exemptions, narrowed coverage, lowered standards, weakened administration, limited investigation, or in some other way worked to weaken the bill.\nThe surviving proposal as approved by the conference committee finally passed the House on June 13, 1938, by a vote of 291 to 89. Shortly there-after, the Senate approved it without a record of the votes. Congress then sent the bill to the President. On June 25, 1938, the President signed the Fair Labor Standards Act to become effective on October 24, 1938.43\nJonathan Grossman was the Historian for the U.S. Department of Labor.

Crist has been a member of the Democratic Party since 2012; he was previously a Republican before becoming an independent in 2010.\nBorn in Pennsylvania and raised in St. Petersburg, Florida, Crist graduated from Florida State University and Samford University, where he received his Juris Doctor degree. He served in the Florida Senate from 1993 to 1999, vacating his seat to run unsuccessfully against incumbent Bob Graham for the U.S. Senate in 1998. He won a 2000 special election to serve as Florida education commissioner from 2001 to 2003 and a 2002 election to serve as Florida attorney general from 2003 to 2007. He was elected Governor of Florida in 2006 after winning against Democrat Jim Davis.\nWhile he was governor, Crist again ran for the U.S. Senate in 2010. He initially led in polls in the race for the Republican nomination, but was later overtaken by Marco Rubio. In April of that year, he left the Republican Party to run in the general election as an independent, losing to Rubio in a three-way race. He took 30% of the vote to Rubio's 49% and Democratic nominee Kendrick Meek had 20%. Crist's term as governor ended in January 2011.\nOn December 7, 2012, Crist joined the Democratic Party, having endorsed President Barack Obama for reelection in 2012. On November 1, 2013, he announced that he was running for governor in the 2014 election. Crist lost to Republican governor Rick Scott, his successor, by a 1% margin. In 2016, Crist was elected to Congress from his home district, the St. Petersburg-based 13th, defeating incumbent Republican David Jolly, 52%–48% and becoming the first Democrat to represent this district since 1955. In the 117th Congress, Crist was the only former governor serving in the House.\nCrist was the Democratic nominee in the 2022 Florida gubernatorial election, resigning from the House in August 2022 to focus on his campaign. He was defeated by incumbent governor Ron DeSantis in a landslide.\nOn June 7, 2023, the White House announced Crist's nomination as U.S. ambassador to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency; his nomination lapsed without action by the U.S. Senate, and expired at the end of the 118th Congress on January 3, 2025.\nEarly life and education\n[edit]Crist was born in Altoona, Pennsylvania,[1] on July 24, 1956, to Charles Joseph Crist, an American physician of Greek Cypriot and Lebanese descent,[2] and Nancy (née Lee), of Scots-Irish, Swiss, and Welsh descent.[2][3] His family name is adapted from the original Greek name \"Christodoulos\".[4] As a child, Crist moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, where he attended Riviera Junior High School and St. Petersburg High School, from which he graduated in 1974. He is the second of four children and has three sisters: Margaret Crist Wood, Elizabeth Crist Hyden, and Catherine Crist Kennedy. He attended Wake Forest University for two years. While at Wake Forest, Crist was a walk-on quarterback for the Demon Deacons[5] during his freshman and sophomore years, before transferring to Florida State University in Tallahassee. Crist earned his undergraduate degree from Florida State, where he was elected vice president of the student body and joined the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. He received his J.D. from Samford University Cumberland School of Law.[6][7]\nEarly career\n[edit]After graduating from Cumberland School of Law in 1981, and passing the bar on his third attempt,[8] Crist was hired as general counsel to Minor League Baseball, which was headquartered in St. Petersburg. Drawn to politics, Crist was a candidate for public office for the first time in 1986, in the Republican primary for a state Senate seat in Pinellas County. After losing in a runoff, Crist joined his brother-in-law in private practice in St. Petersburg, but soon returned to politics as an aide on the successful 1988 United States Senate campaign of Connie Mack III, whom he has since described as his political mentor.[9]\nFlorida Senate\n[edit]In 1992, Crist was elected to a two-year term to the Florida Senate from the 20th District, which encompassed parts of St. Petersburg and South Tampa.[10] He defeated longtime incumbent Democratic state senator Helen Gordon Davis of Tampa, 58.3 to 41.7%.[11][12] Crist was able to unseat Gordon Davis following the 1992 decennial redistricting process, which significantly reconfigured the districts in the Tampa Bay area.[11] His victory was credited with helping to end the Democratic Party's 128-year control of the Florida Senate, as the Republicans netted three seats in 1992, resulting in a 20–20 tie between the parties.[11]\nCrist was known as a law-and-order senator, sponsoring legislation requiring inmates to serve at least 85% of their sentences before becoming eligible for parole.[1] He supported teacher salary increases, charter schools, and a specialty license plate for Everglades conservation.[10] With Crist as chairman, the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee investigated actions of then-governor Lawton Chiles amid allegations that Chiles's campaign had made \"scare calls\" to senior citizens days before the 1994 gubernatorial election. Chiles testified before the committee and admitted that his campaign had made the calls.[1][9]\nIn 1994, Crist was reelected to a four-year term in the Senate, defeating Democrat Dana Lynn Maley with 63.3% of the vote.[13]\nU.S. Senate campaign and Florida education commissioner\n[edit]Crist gained recognition in 1998 as the Republican challenger to incumbent Democratic U.S. senator Bob Graham. Crist campaigned conservatively on taxation, crime, and the ongoing Clinton–Lewinsky scandal, but agreed with Graham on issues such as healthcare and statehood for Puerto Rico. Crist also campaigned on being younger, more energetic, and more able to address Floridians' needs.[14] He lost to Graham by 26 percentage points,[15] but gained significant name recognition, and was appointed by Governor Jeb Bush to serve as the deputy secretary of the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation in 1999 upon the conclusion of his Senate service.[16] He served until 2000, when he ran for Florida education commissioner in a November special election created by the resignation of incumbent commissioner Tom Gallagher. He won by over 500,000 votes and assumed the office in January 2001.[17] Crist would ultimately be the last statewide elected education commissioner, as a 1998 amendment to the Constitution of Florida turned the position into one appointed by the governor of Florida after his departure.[9] Crist left the office after he was elected attorney general in 2002.\nFlorida attorney general\n[edit]In 2002, Crist was elected Florida attorney general. His candidacy was supported by the host of America's Most Wanted, John Walsh. Walsh and other supporters cited his work with the Center for Missing and Exploited Children.[18][19]\nCivil rights and consumer groups praised Crist for expanding the attorney general's powers during his time in office. These powers enabled him and future attorneys general to have greater power to prosecute civil rights and fraud cases. Crist also worked to combat email spam, freeze utility rates, end telecom deception, and protect the environment.[20]\nGovernor of Florida\n[edit]Tenure\n[edit]Crist was elected to the governorship of Florida in the 2006 election, defeating Democrat Jim Davis 52% to 45%. In his inaugural pledge to the people of Florida, he promised to lower taxes, improve the state education system, reduce crime, lower drug costs, expand access to health insurance, assist senior citizens, and protect the environment.[21] However, his promise to lower taxes would prove to be difficult to keep during the Great Recession, and he eventually relented in 2009 after being sent a budget by the Florida legislature which included a 2.2 billion dollar raise in taxes and fees.[22] He also had a mixed record on environmental issues.[23][24][25][26]\nNonetheless, Crist remained widely popular with Floridians during his term, and in a June 2007 Quinnipiac University polling survey, Crist had a 70 percent approval rating among Floridians.[27] An April 2009 poll showed him with a 68 percent approval rating among Republicans and independents and a 66 percent approval rating among Democrats.[28] Crist drew criticism from the right for supporting the Obama administration's economic stimulus plan.[29][30][31][32] In 2010, rather than seek reelection as governor, he left the Republican Party to run for the Senate as an independent. Shortly thereafter, Crist announced that he had moderated his views against LGBT adoption and marriage.[33]\nFundraising controversies\n[edit]In February 2006, Crist attended a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, hosted by future president Donald Trump, with guests paying $500 to attend. Two of the guests became subjects of controversy.[34] Crist returned $1,000 in campaign contributions to one of those guests as a result.[35]\nIn 2009, Crist saw the man he had chosen as Florida GOP finance chairman, his former fraternity brother, oil magnate Harry Sargeant III, forced to step down.[36] One of Sargeant's employees, Ala'a al-Ali of the Dominican Republic, was indicted in Los Angeles for organizing $5,000 in illegal campaign contributions to Crist, as well as $50,000 to presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, John McCain and Rudy Giuliani.[37]\nRole in the 2008 presidential election\n[edit]Senator John McCain endorsed Crist's 2006 campaign for governor, traveling the state to campaign with him. The day before the general election, Crist held a campaign event with McCain in Jacksonville. Later, when the Republican presidential primary debates were held in St. Petersburg, Crist embraced McCain. Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, who had also campaigned for Crist during the gubernatorial election, had sought his endorsement.[38][39][40][41]\nIn May 2007, Crist signed legislation moving the date of Florida's presidential primary to January 29, 2008, contrary to national political party rules.[42] Crist joined Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm in asking that their states' delegates be seated. Both national conventions ended up seating all delegates, but with only a half vote each for the sanctioned states.[43][44][45][46]\nOn January 26, 2008, Crist endorsed McCain in the Republican primary.[47] McCain won the Florida primary by five percentage points.[48]\nOn October 28, 2008, Crist extended early voting hours of operation and declared that a \"state of emergency exists\", due to record voter turnout and resultant hours-long waits at locations throughout the state.[49][50]\nOn November 12–14, 2008, Crist hosted the Republican Governors Association (RGA) annual meeting in Miami. Held the week after the Democratic Party victories in the 2008 election,[51] there was speculation about the meeting's tone. Then Alaska governor Sarah Palin, the defeated 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, was a featured participant and speaker.\nCrist's speech at the RGA conference, \"Listen to the Voters and Serve\", included his sentiments on how the GOP should evolve:\nThis party can no longer hope to reach Hispanics, African Americans and other minority groups – we need to just do it. Embracing cultures and lifestyles will make us a better party and better leaders. This desire for inclusiveness is near and dear to my heart ... Last week, the American people made a choice and this week, if we choose to call ourselves leaders, if we truly endeavor to serve with a servant's heart for the people who count on us, then we too must work together, listen to one another and learn from the leaders who made the kind of history the American people deserve.[52]\nCrist held a joint interview with Governor Mark Sanford of South Carolina in which they discussed the split in the Republican Party over where to direct the party's efforts to gain more voters.[53]\n2010 U.S. Senate campaign\n[edit]On May 12, 2009, Crist announced that he would not run for reelection as governor in 2010, making him the first Florida governor not to run for reelection since 1964.[54] Instead he ran for the US Senate. His two main opponents were former Florida House speaker Marco Rubio,[55][56] and U.S. representative Kendrick Meek.[57]\nCrist was initially the front-runner in the Republican primary, but later trailed Rubio in polls.[58][59]\nCrist announced his intent to run as an unaffiliated candidate in the election, while at the same time, according to a press release from his campaign, he remained a registered Republican.[60] Crist officially changed his registration status to \"non party affiliated\" on May 13, 2010. He did not return campaign contributions made while he was a Republican.[61][62] Crist lost the general election, receiving 29.7% of the vote to Rubio's 48.9% and Meek's 20.2%.[63]\nIn April 2011, as part of a settlement of a copyright lawsuit brought by musician David Byrne, Crist apologized for his Senate campaign's use of Byrne's song \"Road to Nowhere\" without permission.[64][65]\nBy the spring of 2015, there was speculation that Crist would seek the Democratic nomination for the 2016 United States Senate election in Florida. This would have been his third run for the seat (he lost in 1998 and 2010). In March 2015, Crist said he would not seek the nomination. In the same month he endorsed U.S. congressman Patrick Murphy's Senate candidacy.\nHiatus (2011–2014)\n[edit]In January 2011, Crist joined the Tampa office of national personal injury law firm Morgan & Morgan after expressing an interest in returning to the legal field during his final week in office as governor of Florida. Crist worked primarily in the firm's class-action sector as a complex-litigation attorney, serving as a \"rainmaker\" for the firm.[66] In November 2016, after almost six years with the firm, he was elected to represent Florida's 13th congressional district.[67] In February 2018, Brad Slager of Sunshine State News, cited evidence that Morgan & Morgan was \"attempting to purge all evidence\" of its relationship with Crist now that he was a \"rookie congressman\" with \"little-to-no power\".[68]\nIn 2013, Crist performed paid consulting work for Coastal Construction, a Miami-based construction firm owned by Crist's longtime friend Tom Murphy, the father of former U.S. representative Patrick Murphy.[66]\nCrist has been a part-time guest lecturer at Stetson University College of Law,[69] with the title of Distinguished Professorial Lecturer.[70]\nIn August 2012, Crist endorsed President Obama in his campaign for reelection over Republican nominee Mitt Romney, saying that the Republican Party \"pitched so far to the extreme right on issues important to women, immigrants, seniors and students that they've proven incapable of governing for the people.\"[71][72] Crist was a speaker at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, saying, \"I didn't leave the Republican Party; it left me.\"[73][74]\nParty switch and The Party's Over\n[edit]On December 7, 2012, Crist announced that he had joined the Democratic Party.[75] In July 2013, Crist began writing a book, with Newsday columnist Ellis Henican, about his political transition.[76][77] The book, The Party's Over: How the Extreme Right Hijacked the GOP and I Became a Democrat, was released in February 2014.[78][79][80] In the book, Crist said that his career in the Republican Party was destroyed by a hug between him and Obama at a Fort Myers town hall on February 10, 2009. \"It was the kind of hug I'd exchanged with thousands and thousands of Floridians over the years\", Crist wrote. \"I didn't think a thing about it as it was happening.\" But it \"ended my viable life as a Republican politician. I would never have a future in my old party again. My bipartisan hopes and dreams, I would discover soon enough to my shock and disappointment, were vastly overstated and hopelessly out of date.\"[81]\nIn May 2014, Crist told Fusion's Jorge Ramos that he had left the Republican Party because of its racial attitudes. \"I couldn't be consistent with myself and my core beliefs, and stay with a party that was so unfriendly toward the African-American president—I'll just go there\", Crist said. \"I was a Republican and I saw the activists and what they were doing. It was intolerable to me.\" The Washington Post's Chris Cillizza rejected this claim, citing Tampa Bay Times political editor Adam Smith as saying that Crist \"was happy as a Republican when the polls showed him leading Marco Rubio by 20 points.\" Cilizza wrote that Crist's party switch \"epitomized for many within the Republican base that Crist lacked any core principles or beliefs and, instead, simply went with whatever was popular at the moment.\"[82]\nIn a review in The New Republic, Isaac Chotiner called The Party's Over \"a dishonest and boring memoir\" by \"a man with no convictions\".[83] Writing in Rolling Stone magazine in 2014, Jeb Lund described Crist as \"a Republican conveniently converted to Democrat\", adding, \"what made Crist dynamic as a Republican ... was a vaguely populist nose-thumbing at Republican orthodoxy\", and that \"Charlie Crist is a Democrat only if you are a Republican.\"[84]\n2014 gubernatorial election\n[edit]On November 1, 2013, Crist filed to run for governor as a Democrat.[85] He won the Democratic nomination but was defeated in the general election by Republican incumbent Rick Scott by a vote of 2,865,343 (48%) to 2,801,198 (47%), [6] Crist holds the rare distinction of losing a statewide general election in Florida as a Republican, a Democrat and an Independent.[86]\nU.S. House of Representatives\n[edit]Elections\n[edit]2016\n[edit]On October 20, 2015, Crist announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for Florida's 13th congressional district, his home district, in the 2016 U.S. House of Representatives elections.[87] He had previously announced on Twitter that he would not run for political office in 2016.[88] Republican incumbent David Jolly, who succeeded 43-year incumbent Bill Young in a 2014 special election, was vacating the seat to run for the same Senate seat for which Crist ran in 1998 and 2010.[89]\nHowever, when Senator Marco Rubio decided to run for reelection, Jolly dropped out of the Senate race and sought reelection to the House, even though the 13th District had become significantly friendlier to Democrats when a court tossed out Florida's original congressional map. The new map drew nearly all of St. Petersburg, along with most of the more Democratic southern portion of Pinellas County, into the 13th.[90] The district had been in Republican hands without interruption since 1955, and had been one of the first areas of Florida to turn Republican. However, it had become more of a swing district at the presidential level since the 1990s; it has supported a Democrat for president in all but two elections since 1992.[91]\nIn the general election, Crist defeated Jolly by a vote of 184,693 (52%) to 171,149 (48%),[92] becoming the first Democrat to win the seat in 62 years.[93]\n2018\n[edit]In 2018, Crist was endorsed by the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) Action Fund, which called him \"a leader on protecting Florida from and planning for the impacts of climate change during his time as Governor and in Congress.\"[94] Crist won a second term by A vote of 182,717 (58%) to 134,254 (42%).\n2020\n[edit]Crist was re-elected to a third term in the 2020 election, defeating Republican Anna Paulina Luna by a vote of 215,405 (53%) to 190,713 (47%).[95]\nTenure\n[edit]Crist was sworn in on January 3, 2017. He was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition,[96] the New Democrat Coalition,[97] the Climate Solutions Caucus[98] and the U.S.–Japan Caucus.[99]\nOn December 18, 2019, Crist voted for both articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.[100]\nOn January 13, 2021, Crist voted in favor of the single article of impeachment against President Trump during the second impeachment of Donald Trump.[101]\nCrist introduced H.R. 305, which presented the Congressional Gold Medal to Officer Eugene Goodman for his valor during the January 6 United States Capitol attack.[102]\nOn August 31, 2022, Crist resigned from Congress to focus on his gubernatorial campaign.[103]\nCommittee assignments\n[edit]Caucus memberships\n[edit]- New Democrat Coalition[104]\n- Blue Dog Coalition[105]\n- Climate Solutions Caucus[98]\n- U.S.–Japan Caucus[99]\n2022 gubernatorial election\n[edit]On May 4, 2021, Crist announced his intention to run for the Democratic nomination in the 2022 Florida gubernatorial election against incumbent Ron DeSantis.[106] \"[I'm] running on decency and mutual respect,\" Crist explained. \"I love people. And I feel for 'em right now. Gay people. Women. Blacks. They're getting the crap kicked out of 'em by this guy. It's wrong. Somebody has to stop him.\"[107] Crist won the primary election on August 23, 2022, and advanced to face DeSantis in the general election on November 8, 2022. Crist's running mate for lieutenant governor was union leader Karla Hernández-Mats, president of the United Teachers of Dade.[108] However, Crist was defeated by DeSantis, by a vote of 4,614,210 (59%) to 3,106,313 (40%).[109]\nAmbassadorship nomination\n[edit]On June 7, 2023, the White House announced that President Joe Biden had nominated Crist for the position of United States ambassador to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency.[110][111]\n2026 St. Petersburg mayoral election\n[edit]In October 2025, the Tampa Bay Times revealed Crist is considering entering the election for mayor of St. Petersburg, Florida in 2026.[112]\nPolitical positions\n[edit]Abortion\n[edit]In 1995, while in the Florida Senate, Crist joined with two Democrats in the Senate Health Care Committee in voting against a proposal for a mandatory 24-hour waiting period before a woman could have an abortion, resulting in a 3–3 tie vote and the bill's defeat.[113]\nIn 1998, while running for the U.S. Senate, Crist wrote in a Tampa Bay Times questionnaire: \"I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government.\"[113] In a debate that year, he said he did not support a constitutional amendment banning abortion.[113] In 2006, while running for governor, Crist said he did not support overturning Roe v. Wade and opposed a mandatory 24-hour waiting period before a woman could have an abortion.[113]\nIn 2006, Crist's stance on abortion was characterized as unclear.[113]\nIn early 2010, Crist said he would \"fight for pro-life legislative efforts\" and described himself as \"pro-life\".[114]\nBy March 2010, however, as rumors swirled that he would leave the Republican Party and become an independent, Crist reiterated that he did not support overturning Roe v. Wade and told a Christian Family Coalition group, \"We ought to, instead of change laws, change hearts.\"[115]\nIn June 2010, after leaving the Republican Party and becoming an independent, Crist vetoed a bill that would have required, at patient cost, an ultrasound in order to receive an abortion.[116] He called the measure \"punitive\" and \"almost mean-spirited\".[114][116] The bill also included language barring abortion coverage \"under a contract toward which any tax credit or cost-sharing credit is applied.\"[117]\nIn June 2022, Crist harshly criticized the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade, calling it \"shameful, harmful, and wrong\".[118]\nCuba\n[edit]In May 2014, Crist publicly supported lifting the United States embargo against Cuba, arguing it has not helped to change the Cuban government. He had supported the embargo earlier as both a Republican and independent.[119] Also in 2014, he announced he had requested the Department of State's permission to travel to Cuba with a delegation of business, academic and economic development officials. In June, Crist indefinitely postponed the trip.[120][121][122]\nIn 2019, Crist quietly visited Cuba to meet with Cuban officials, despite high bilateral tensions due to alleged Cuban support for the Maduro regime in Venezuela.[123] The three-day trip was not announced by his congressional office and was disclosed due to required filings in the House of Representatives Committee on Ethics, with no details about it on Crist's House website.[123] The trip was sponsored by the Center for Democracy in the Americas, an organization that \"promotes a U.S. policy toward Cuba based on engagement and recognition of Cuba's sovereignty\", according to its website.[123] Photos of Crist smiling during a meeting with Cuban officials, including Cuban foreign minister Bruno Rodríguez, were published in the official newspaper of Cuba's Communist Party during his stay.[123]\nEnvironmental policy\n[edit]In June 2008, Crist proposed that Florida buy 187,000 acres (76,000 ha) from the United States Sugar Corporation for $1.75 billion. The proposed purchase would have removed about 187,000 acres of sugar farming for Everglades restoration efforts. A fairness commission found that price to be too high by $400 million and, ultimately, the purchase was reduced to 73,000 acres (30,000 ha) of not only sugar, but also citrus for about $590 million in 2010, greatly setting back the originally touted restoration effort.[124][125][126][23]\nIn 2007, Crist signed executive orders to impose stricter air pollution standards in Florida, with an aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[24][25] In his gubernatorial campaign, he opposed offshore oil drilling. He altered that position in June 2008, when oil reached peak prices, saying, \"I mean, let's face it, the price of gas has gone through the roof, and Florida families are suffering, and my heart bleeds for them.\"[26]\nFiscal policies\n[edit]Crist supported President Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a stimulus package in response to the Great Recession.[29][30][31] Fellow Republicans were angered by Crist's support for the stimulus.[32]\nCrist called the act a \"godsend\",[127] maintaining that it had saved the jobs of nearly 20,000 Florida schoolteachers and other school workers in 2009–2010.[128]\nFelons' voting rights\n[edit]In a February 12, 2018, USA Today op-ed, Crist wrote that Florida was \"one of only three states that permanently bans non-violent, ex-felons from voting\" and that this \"disenfranchisement of 1.5 million of our fellow citizens is shameful.\"[129]\nGun policy\n[edit]In 2008, Crist signed a provision preventing employers from prohibiting employees from bringing firearms to the workplace, as long as the weapons are secure and the employees have a concealed carry license.[130][131]\nAfter the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Crist announced a reversal of some of his previous stances on gun control. Before 2012, he had sometimes accused his opponents of not supporting gun rights strongly enough. He was endorsed by the NRA in 2006. In 2012, Crist announced that he supported reinstating the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, banning high-capacity magazines, and instating more extensive background checks.[132] In the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, he announced his support for additional measures, including a ban on bump stocks,[133] and also said he did not support arming teachers.[134]\nWhen he left office as governor in 2011, Crist had an A rating from the NRA.[135] In 2016, he received an F rating from the NRA.[136]\nImmigration\n[edit]In June 2017, Crist was one of 24 House Democrats to vote for Kate's Law. The next month, he was one of five Democrats to vote to fund President Trump's border wall, and the next day, issued a statement saying that he opposed the wall.[137]\nLGBT rights\n[edit]In 2006, as a proposed state constitutional amendment banning same-sex unions was headed to the ballot in Florida, Crist said that such an amendment was unnecessary because state law already barred same-sex marriages.[138] But in September 2005, he had signed a petition for the amendment during the Republican primary at the Christian Coalition's request.[138][139] Crist said in campaign materials at the time that he supported \"traditional marriage\".[138] In 2008, he said he voted for the amendment, which passed.[138]\nIn a debate and a radio talk show appearance in 2006, Crist indicated support for civil unions.[139]\nAs governor, Crist downplayed the marriage issue, saying in a late 2007 CNN appearance: \"It's not an issue that moves me. I'm just a live-and-let-live kind of guy.\"\nFor some time Crist supported Florida's ban on same-sex adoption, which had been in place since 1977.[140] He publicly expressed support for the ban beginning when he was attorney general in 2006.\nIn 2008, Crist again announced his support for the Federal Marriage Amendment. Also that year, he told the Orlando Sentinel that the issue was not \"top-tier\" for him,[138][139] even as he supported a Florida ballot measure to amend the state constitution prohibiting same-sex marriage that passed later that year.\nAlso in 2008, in the case of In re Gill, a Miami-Dade judge struck down the ban on same-sex couple adoption.[140] As the case proceeded through appeals, Crist expressed support for the adoption ban as late as February 2010,[140] but by June 2010, expressed openness to changing Florida law to allow same-sex adoption, saying a better approach \"would be to let judges make that decision on a case-by-case basis\".[140][141]\nIn September 2010, Crist said that he had had an \"appropriate evolution\" on gay rights and was considering dropping the state's appeal of to block gay adoption.[33] Days later, after an appeals court affirmed gay couples had a right to adopt, Crist hailed the ruling \"a very good day for Florida\" and \"a great day for children\" and announced that the state would no longer seek to enforce the ban.[140] In a Senate debate the next month, he attributed his shift in positions to \"the convergence of life experience and wisdom\", saying he had become more tolerant and become less judgmental with age.[140]\nAt about the same time in 2010, he declared his support for civil unions encompassing \"the full range of legal protections\" including \"access to a loved one in the hospital, inheritance rights, the fundamental things people need to take care of their families\".[139] The voter-enacted 2008 state constitutional amendment Crist supported may nonetheless have prohibited them.[139]\nOn May 9, 2013, Crist announced that he supports same-sex marriage: \"I most certainly support marriage equality in Florida and look forward to the day it happens here.\"[142]\nIn January 2014, Crist apologized for his support for the 2008 same-sex marriage ban and for the same-sex adoption ban, telling an Orlando LGBT publication: \"I'm sorry I did that. It was a mistake. I was wrong. Please forgive me.\"[143][144][145]\nMarijuana legalization\n[edit]Crist said \"fully legalizing marijuana\" would bring about \"true justice in our state and in our country\" in announcing his candidacy for governor in 2021.[146] He also voted for the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act to legalize cannabis at the federal level and expunge cannabis convictions in 2020.[147][148] In 2018, he introduced the Fairness in Federal Drug Testing Under State Laws Act to limit the firing of federal workers and denial of applicants for cannabis use.[149]\nOther issues\n[edit]As governor, Crist supported capital punishment.[150] He reiterated his support for it in October 2022.[151]\nAfter claims that computerized voting machines undercounted votes in black communities, Crist endorsed legislation requiring paper records of all ballots cast in elections.[152]\nIn April 2010, Crist vetoed an education bill that would have linked teacher pay to test scores, a piece of legislation conservatives strongly supported.[153]\nCrist supported increased regulation of the insurance industry, including property insurance rates (in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina) and health insurance. The Citizen's Property Insurance Corp and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund had been described as risky and underfunded. Standing next to former football star Dan Marino (whose son, Michael, is autistic and inspired the Dan Marino Foundation[154]), Crist signed a law expanding health coverage statewide for autism disorders and legislation expanding low-income coverage and creating public and private insurance options in Florida.[155][156][157][158][159][160]\nThe abortion hurdles bill Crist vetoed in June 2010 also included some provisions \"intended to thwart\" the Affordable Care Act, the federal health care reform legislation championed by President Obama.[116]\nIn April 2022, Crist said he opposed the repeal of the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, arguing that it would hurt Florida's economy and tourism.[161]\nPersonal life\n[edit]In July 1979, Crist married Amanda Morrow. They divorced within a year.[162]\nCrist became engaged to Carole Rome on July 3, 2008, after nine months of dating, and they married on December 12 of that year at the First Methodist Church of St. Petersburg, of which Crist is a member.[163] In February 2017, Crist announced that he had filed for divorce,[164] and the divorce was completed that year.[165]\nIn 2022, while running for governor again, Crist said that he was engaged to a medical sonographer whom he had met in 2017 and who is the mother of six children.[165]\nElectoral history\n[edit]| Party | Candidate | Votes | % | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Republican | Charlie Crist | 365,894 | 66.40% | |\n| Republican | Andy Martin | 184,739 | 33.60% | |\n| Total votes | 550,633 | 100.00% |\n| Party | Candidate | Votes | % | ±% | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Democratic | Bob Graham (incumbent) | 2,436,407 | 62.47% | −2.93% | |\n| Republican | Charlie Crist | 1,463,755 | 37.53% | +2.94% | |\n| Majority | 972,652 | 24.94% | −5.87% | ||\n| Turnout | 3,900,162 | 46.84% | |||\n| Total votes | 3,900,162 | 100.00% | |||\n| Democratic hold | Swing |\n| Party | Candidate | Votes | % | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Republican | Charlie Crist | 2,979,297 | 53.72% | |\n| Democratic | George H.

And the incident with Shcherban, splashed across the newspapers in the Sunshine State, would be the first instance of Crist’s association with Trump becoming a primary issue.\nIt wouldn’t be the last.\nNow, 16 years later, Trump's shadow again hangs over a Crist gubernatorial primary.\n“Anything related to Trump is probably going to hurt Crist in a Democratic primary. That’s just a blanket statement,” said Brad Coker, pollster for Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy. “Charlie has been such a political chameleon over the years that he’s always vulnerable to attacks like this.”\nCrist and Trump are no longer friends or allies. Crist today is a Democrat; back then, he was a Republican and, in between, he was an independent. And Trump has gone from a questionable figure in GOP primary politics to becoming the dominant voice of the Republican Party. The former president is reviled by the Democratic Party, which also despises his protégé, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\nStill, the arc of the Crist-Trump political alliance and friendship spans a crucial era in Crist’s political career, when he was at the zenith of his Republican power from 2005 to 2010. That year, he lost a Senate race, ultimately as an independent. He lost another race for governor in 2014 as a Democrat.\nElected to Congress in 2016, Crist faces a Democratic primary opponent for governor who — unlike him — has actually won statewide as a Democrat, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried.\nOn social media and in private conversations with donors and allies, Fried’s campaign has signaled an effort to open a new, more heated phase of the primary by questioning Crist’s once-warm relationship with Trump — from the time Crist gave him a Florida-shaped birthday cake in 2005 to Crist congratulating Trump via text over his 2016 presidential win, which sent Democrats reeling.\nCrist's campaign dismissed any talk of his past Trump friendship harming him now.\n“This is nonsense. Charlie is the only candidate for governor who has voted twice to impeach President Trump, and Florida voters know exactly where he stands,\" press secretary Samantha Ramirez said in an email. \"Charlie has always been open with Floridians about his record, and that’s why he’s won three elections to Congress as a proud Democrat in the last five years.”\nAs for the Trump friendship, the Crist campaign says, the former president was not a toxic figure when Crist began courting him in 2005 as part of his successful GOP bid for governor. Earlier that year, Hillary Clinton attended Trump’s wedding to the then-Melania Knauss.\nCrist detailed his exodus from the GOP in a book, \"The Party’s Over,\" and his campaign points out that Republicans ostracized him for embracing Democratic President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus plan. Crist was a key Florida surrogate for Obama in his 2012 presidential re-election campaign, and polls have shown that Crist is relatively popular with Black voters, who comprise about 28 percent of the Florida Democratic Party electorate.\nPowered by those Black voters, Crist leads Fried 44-27 percent overall, with state Sen. Annette Taddeo in a distant third at 3 percent, according to the latest Mason-Dixon survey of the Florida race conducted last month. Coker and other Florida insiders say Crist’s lead is also heavily rooted in his name identification advantage — one that he acquired by running statewide six times for four different offices with three different party affiliations since 1998.\n“If I were trailing in a Democratic primary, I would use Trump,” Coker said.\nWhen Crist ran the last time for governor, in 2014, he faced scant Democratic primary opposition from a little-known and vastly underfunded state senator, Nan Rich.\nA website attacking Crist as a Republican in that Democratic primary was not used much in that campaign but remains active today.\nCrist went on to lose the 2014 race against then-Gov. Rick Scott, who was re-elected. Scott first won the office in 2010 when Crist decided not to seek re-election as a Republican governor and instead run for Senate. But Crist left the GOP when Marco Rubio threatened to beat him in the primary, and he became an independent and lost that general election, too.\n\"One day he can be campaigning with Trump, and the next he’s losing to Marco Rubio and then to Rick Scott. He doesn’t stand for anything, and Florida voters won’t stand or lose with him again,” Fried campaign spokesman Keith Edwards said via text message.\nThroughout the week, Edwards began using Twitter to criticize Crist's record — an opening salvo in Fried's campaign. Edwards said Crist will not get a “free hall pass” in this primary when compared to 2014. The Florida primary is scheduled for Aug. 23.\nBut pollster Steve Vancore said he’s not sure if Crist will pay more of a price for once being a Republican because it’s old news.\n“He’s been forgiven for being a Republican, and I’m not sure the Trump hit will work,” he said. “But just because Democrats have forgiven Crist doesn’t mean that they’re enthusiastic about him.”\nAs with the Mason-Dixon survey, Vancore said his own internal polling shows DeSantis in a strong position against any Democratic nominee in Florida, a state Trump won by more than 3 percentage points — a blowout by Sunshine State standards where elections can be decided by a point or less.\nTrump’s relationship with Crist began in 2005 when Crist was Florida’s elected attorney general running as a more-moderate Republican candidate, compared to his primary rival.\nTrump’s spokesman would not comment for this article.\nTrump’s support for Crist was gold for the candidate, who raised millions of dollars at four separate Trump fundraisers at his Palm Beach and New York City properties in the 2006 election cycle. At Trump’s first fundraiser for Crist, held on the birthday of “The Apprentice\" star in 2005, Crist presented Trump with a Florida-shaped birthday cake.\nAt the second Trump fundraiser, at Mar-a-Lago, Crist hit Trump-related turbulence when the former Ukrainian regional governor, Shcherban, inexplicably showed up at the event. A second guest, who was under investigation by Crist’s attorney general’s office at the time, was also in attendance and gave money. Crist’s campaign ultimately returned his money.\nCrist’s Republican opponent at the time, Tom Gallagher, criticized the candidate’s relationship with the pro-gambling Trump, noting that “investors like Mr. Trump are always looking for a return.’’\nCrist and Trump denied impropriety or any pay-for-play notion.\nTrump backed Crist's doomed Senate run in 2010 but he didn't contribute to his 2014 gubernatorial bid as a Democrat.\nUnlike the 2010 and the 2014 races, Trump became a campaign issue in Crist’s 2016 congressional campaign, but in a totally unexpected way. At the time, the Crist-backing Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee attacked his Republican rival, Rep. David Jolly, by doctoring a photo to make it appear as if the incumbent congressman had been in a picture with Trump when he never had been.\nAdding to the insult for Jolly: He had been ostracized from the Republican Party because he was critical of Trump, while Crist got a pass for his prior association with Trump.\n“That was the only race in the country where the Republican had denounced Trump and the Democratic nominee wouldn’t, was soft on him,” Jolly said.\n“But politics is politics,” he said. “If there was a relationship between Trump and Charlie to exploit, a skilled Democratic candidate would do that. In 2016, it was still fresh. Today, it’s less so. But it won’t be hard for Nikki Fried to find those quotes and pictures.”\nAfter Crist won the race in 2016, he told Politico that he believed Trump would be \"pragmatic,\" and he said his House Democratic colleagues accepted his political conversion.\n\"What is the expression? Blessed is the convert,” Crist told the publication. \"They’ve treated me very well because, though I used to be a Republican, I saw the light.”\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        After being tagged with with fellow Republican Donald Trump last week, David Jolly is hitting back at Charlie Crist when it comes to being associated with the Manhattan real estate developer and GOP presidential candidate.\nAs Jolly was easily winning his Republican primary against Mark Bircher in Florida’s 13th Congressional District last Tuesday night, Crist issued a statement saying that “it saddens me to think that anyone who supports Donald Trump’s agenda could ever represent Pinellas County.”\nThe inference was that Jolly is backing Trump in the presidential election. Though Jolly hasn’t ruled out ultimately supporting his party’s standard bearer for president, he hasn’t done so to date, and immediately accused Crist of lying.\nMatthew Van Name, Crist’s campaign manager, then followed up with a memo detailing how Crist should essentially walk all over Jolly in the general election, citing polling and financial numbers that favor Crist, who is now running in a seat that definitely favors Democrats after redistricting last year.\nClearly, Jolly has had enough. In a new video issued on Tuesday, the Indian Shores Republican discusses Crist’s own relationship with Trump, including multiple fundraising events at Trump Tower in New York, golf tournaments at Trump International Golf Course in West Palm, and a “questionable courtship” of the business mogul to help raise money for a property tax amendment.\nThe Jolly camp provided financial forms to show how Trump twice provided $2,400 campaign contributions to Crist’s run for Senate in 2010, and also links to a Tampa Bay Times story referring to getting Trump’s help in raising money for a constitutional amendment on the January 2008 presidential primary ballot that would double the state’s homestead exemption and allow people to transfer their accrued Save Our Homes benefits when they move (the measure was approved).\nThe story reported that if the amendment had already been in place, “Trump would have saved tens of thousands of dollars.”\n“When it comes to Charlie Crist, political convenience will always trump honesty,” Jolly said. “There’s only one candidate in this race who has ever sought political favor from Donald Trump and that’s Charlie Crist. But to no surprise to all of us here in Pinellas, when it was politically convenient for Charlie Crist last week to abandon his friend, he turned his back on Donald Trump like he’s turned on us so many times.”\nThe Crist camp responded in kind.\n“This is a truly bizarre video from David Jolly, a guy who said he still has a lot of respect for Donald Trump and is supporting the Trump agenda, even after all the crazy and hateful things Donald Trump has said,” responded Crist spokesman Kevin Cate.\nThe Jolly camp told reporters in their statement the Crist camp would “receive a canned email statement from the Crist campaign saying David Jolly has ‘respect’ for Mr. Trump.” In the audio clip provided by the Jolly campaign, Jolly makes the comment when referring to Trump’s signature campaign motto of “making America great again.”\n“I have a lot of respect for Donald Trump, but I will tell you I disagree with his slogan,” Jolly said. “I believe America today already is the greatest nation on the face of the Earth.”\nThe Crist camp also criticized Jolly for going negative.\n“Your readers may be old enough to remember the David Jolly a couple of months ago who pretended he wasn’t going to even say Charlie’s name,” said Cate. “This is just another reason most people don’t trust lobbyists like David Jolly.”\nIn fact, Jolly said at his press conference announcing that he was again running for his congressional seat in late June that he didn’t intend to speak at all about Crist in his effort to win reelection.\nWatch the video below:\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

David Perdue is seeking reelection in a campaign that could determine control of the U.S. Senate. He’s doing so during a pandemic that has created hardship for ordinary workers, even as the wealthy have only become more so. The Republican says that he can restore the economy to health and cites his record as a businessman who created jobs that “helped working families make it from payday to payday,” as his Senate website claims.\nCo-published by Newsweek\nHis longest-serving CEO gig, at Tennessee-based Dollar General, remains an integral part of his biographical arc. He tells crowds he added 2,600 stores in four years and over 20,000 jobs, as he did at a Cobb County Republican meeting in 2013.\nDollar General, which he ran between 2003 and 2007, rests on a business model of offering low-cost goods at rock-bottom prices while paying workers poorly. The stores, ubiquitous in low-income neighborhoods, are generally understaffed and have become magnets for crime, according to a recent investigation. The corporate dictum that wages remain at 5% of gross sales “placed us at the bottom of a low-paying industry,” Cal Turner Jr., the son of Dollar General’s founder, told ProPublica.\nPerdue presided over a more than 30-fold increase in the number of employee lawsuits filed against the company, according to a Capital & Main review of court filings. While he worked at the firm, 2,494 individual employment cases were filed charging the company with gender and racial discrimination, rampant wage theft, failure to provide medical leave and other workplace violations. In the four years leading up to Perdue taking the helm, 76 employment cases were filed in federal court.\nThat vast increase mostly appears due to more than 2,000 wage theft cases filed in 2006 by Dollar General managers who claimed they were classified as managers only so that the company could circumvent federal law, which required hourly employees to be paid overtime when working over 40 hours in a single week according to the employees’ complaints. In an effort to keep their store’s payroll low, these “managers” were allegedly forced to work more than 70 hours a week, and sometimes up to 90 hours a week, without earning overtime, despite doing much the same work as hourly employees. The plaintiffs sought to be represented collectively in a lawsuit that claimed they were misclassified as managers, but the court eventually required that the cases be filed individually, according to Mark Petro, an Alabama-based attorney involved in the effort.\nPerdue prospered greatly, receiving tens of millions of dollars in compensation from the chain, even as profits declined under his management.\nTaken together, the lawsuits filed during Perdue’s tenure paint a portrait of a chain that is alleged to have put extraordinary pressure on its workforce, and that is alleged to have operated in such a way to limit opportunity for Black and women employees. Meanwhile, Perdue prospered greatly, receiving tens of millions of dollars in compensation from the chain, even as profits declined under his management.\nPerdue stepped in to run the family-owned business following a brief, unsuccessful attempt to revive Dallas-based textile company Pillowtex, in part by outsourcing that company’s manufacturing jobs. Perdue would later acknowledge one of his greatest areas of expertise at a deposition connected to the company’s bankruptcy filing: “Yeah, I spent most of my career doing that,” he said in response to a question about outsourcing, according to a transcript obtained by Politico. The company’s demise led to the loss of 7,600 jobs. Asked later about that quote, Purdue had this to say: “Defend it? I’m proud of it,” he said at a 2014 press appearance. “This is a part of American business, part of any business. Outsourcing is the procurement of products and services to help your business run. People do that all day.”\nPerdue also ramped up outsourcing at Dollar General, increasing imports from China, as the Intercept has reported. In addition, he pursued a strategy of aggressive expansion, increasing the number of Dollar General stores by almost 30% to 8,205 during his time there.\nThe immense pressure allegedly placed on managers to keep payrolls low may have impacted those they supervised. Hourly employees reported they were forced to work “off the clock” and had their pay records altered, according to a separate wage theft lawsuit filed in New York District Court in 2006. The court denied the hourly employees’ request to be considered as a class in 2011 but settled the cases of 26 of the plaintiffs individually in 2013, according to court records. Attorneys who represented the thousands of Dollar General managers who say they suffered from wage theft would not comment on the resolution of those cases.\nDollar General and Perdue did not respond to repeated requests for comment on this story.\n* * *\nDeKalb County Commissioner Lorraine Cochran-Johnson has a problem with the way chains like Dollar General have proliferated in the poorer pockets of her county, which includes parts of Atlanta. She’s spoken to family grocery store owners who refuse to locate near Dollar General stores because they are unable to compete with their low prices, and she has seen firsthand how thinly staffed dollar stores contribute to theft. She was surprised when Sen. Perdue began touting his leadership at Dollar General in his campaign for Senate.\n“You go into a community that already has challenges, and you are committed to paying the lowest wage possible, hiring the least amount of people,” she says. “But is that something to be proud of?” Cochran-Johnson has spearheaded a temporary countywide ban on “small-box discount stores” like Dollar General and Family Dollar.\nWhile allegations of wage theft, low pay and gender discrimination during Perdue’s tenure as CEO of Dollar General have previously been reported, Capital & Main has uncovered new evidence of allegedly discriminatory practices at the company while Perdue was at the helm, including those that singled out pregnant women and African Americans. Dollar General was sued by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for discriminating against Black applicants — legal action that resulted in a $6 million settlement.\nRachel Armington, a cashier at a Florida Dollar General store, was suffering from a difficult pregnancy. She said her requests to sit in a chair went unheeded, according to a 2007 lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Jacksonville. Armington alleged she was derided as “fat” by a manager and was asked to clean up rat droppings and urine from store merchandise. What she claims led to her firing was a request to take time off following the birth of a baby with a life threatening medical condition. The case, one of eight pregnancy discrimination cases filed during Perdue’s tenure, was settled.\nBut accusations levelled at Dollar General by women employees during Perdue’s tenure do not stop there. A gender discrimination case filed in 2006 became a campaign issue when he ran for the Senate in 2014. More than 2,000 female store managers sued Dollar General, claiming they were paid less than men with the same job title. Several years after Perdue left Dollar General, the company paid employees a settlement of almost $19 million. Perdue denied wrongdoing on the part of the company in a debate with his then rival for the Senate seat, Michelle Nunn, saying that the lawsuit was “settled five years after I left.” He also downplayed the number of women involved in the suit. “It was less than 2,000 people. We had upwards of 70,000 people at that company.”\nWhat has received less attention is a civil rights case alleging racially discriminatory hiring practices that stemmed from a charge filed in 2004, when Perdue was at the helm of the company. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charged Dollar General with conditioning job offers on criminal background checks in a way that disproportionately screened out Black applicants in violation of federal law.\nThe applicant who filed the initial charge told Dollar General she had a six-year-old drug conviction before starting work at an Illinois store. But her job was allegedly revoked because the chain regarded her conviction as a disqualifying factor for 10 years.\nLast year, Dollar General paid $6 million to settle the case. Now the company is under a consent decree to ensure “a fair process” for hiring and one that is not based on “unproven myths and biases about people with criminal backgrounds,” according to a statement by Gregory Gochanour, regional attorney for the EEOC’s Chicago District.\nOutsourcing “is a part of American business, part of any business,” Perdue explains. “People do that all day.”\nBut African Americans employed by the company during Perdue’s tenure have also alleged mistreatment, as well as pay discrimination. Catricea Davis, an African American store manager, allegedly faced harassment from four white employees she supervised, including being called a racist epithet, according to a 2007 suit filed in Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division. Her calls to a corporate hotline and a district manager failed to remedy the situation, she claimed.\nDavis “was forced to endure the racial harassment because she was unable to find sufficient replacement employees due to the low wage offered by” Dollar General, according to the lawsuit. Because the employees refused to work under her supervision, she found herself working 50 hour weeks, she alleged.\nThe case was one of at least 15 racial discrimination cases filed during Perdue’s tenure. The parties reached an agreement and the case was dismissed.\n* * *\nPerdue’s growth plans led to a turbulent tenure at Dollar General, and the company saw its profits decline. He embarked on a restructuring plan in 2006 that would involve the closing of 400 stores and the opening of 300 others, according to press reports at the time. Between his first and last year at the helm of the company, profits declined from $299 million to $137.9 million. In 2007, Perdue left Dollar General after arranging for its sale to a private equity firm, KKR, for $7.3 billion. The company was forced to shell out more than $40 million to fend off shareholder lawsuits that alleged Perdue and other board members had undervalued the company in the deal.\nNevertheless, Perdue profited from his time there. Dollar General paid him $42 million in 2007 and 2008, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. “It worked for everybody,” Perdue has said of the buyout. “We saved thousands of jobs with that deal, and I feel like we did it responsibly.”\nToday, Dollar General employees still struggle with low pay. The company recently appeared high on a list compiled by the Government Accountability Office of large firms whose employees earn so little they are forced to rely on Medicaid and food stamps. In Georgia alone, almost 1,400 of Dollar General’s workers rely on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs or SNAP.\n“Dollar General stores aren’t simply a symptom of economic distress, they are actually driving economic distress,” says Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an advocacy organization tracking the growth of dollar stores. In 2017, Georgia had the second-most Dollar General stores in the country, according to Mitchell.\nYears after leaving Dollar General, Perdue would use his time there as a launching pad for his political career, and to connect with women voters.\n“I see some of you ladies in the audience got a little twinkle in your eye. We have a few in the state, I think,” he said. He was warming up a room of Cobb County Republicans with a mention of the discount chain during his first run for Senate. (A video of the 2013 event is posted online.) He wanted them to know that as CEO, he’d created thousands of jobs: “Real jobs,” he said. “Not part time jobs.”\nCopyright 2020 Capital & Main\nRoxane Auer provided research for this story\n-\nPain & ProfitNovember 3, 2025\nDespite Vow to Protect Health Care for Veterans, VA Losing Doctors and Nurses\n-\nColumn - State of InequalityNovember 6, 2025\nCongress Could Get Millions of People Off of SNAP by Raising the Minimum Wage, but It Hasn’t — for 16 Years\n-\nLatest NewsOctober 29, 2025\n‘I’ve Never Seen Anything Like it.’ Aggressive ICE Raids Led One Man to Ask: Should I Self-Deport?\n-\nLatest NewsOctober 31, 2025\nPennsylvania Gas Producer Sues Capital & Main Over Its Reporting on Health Risks\n-\nThe SlickNovember 5, 2025\nThe David vs. Goliath Story of a Ranching Family and an Oil Giant\n-\nLatest NewsOctober 31, 2025\nPeople With Disabilities Struggle to Secure Accessible Housing After Disasters Like the L.A.

TURNER AND SON WAREHOUSE\nAfter his father died unexpectedly, J.L. Turner quit school in the fourth grade to help his family. From then on, he assumed everyone else knew more and he became a keen student of other people. Cal Sr. once said he and his dad never had an original retailing idea. They just worked hard to make sure that others’ good ideas were effectively put into practice.\nLuther and Cal Turner, Sr. each invested $5,000 and bought this building for half price in 1939 when they started J.L. Turner and Son Wholesale Company, a dry-goods business to serve retailers who had survived the depression. The building later became the home of one of the most successful retail companies ever – Dollar General Corporation.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        This story is co-published with Capital & Main\nGeorgia Sen. David Perdue is seeking re-election in a campaign that could determine control of the U.S. Senate. He's doing so during a pandemic that has created hardship for ordinary workers, even as the wealthy have become more so. The Republican says that he can restore the economy to health and cites his record as a businessman who created jobs that \"helped working families make it from payday to payday,\" as his Senate website claims.\nHis longest-serving CEO gig, at Tennessee-based Dollar General, remains an integral part of his biographical arc. He tells crowds he added 2,600 stores in four years and over 20,000 jobs.\nDollar General, which he ran between 2003 and 2007, rests on a business model of offering low-cost goods at rock-bottom prices while paying workers poorly. The stores, ubiquitous in low-income neighborhoods, are generally understaffed and have become magnets for crime, according to a recent investigation. The corporate dictum that wages remain at 5 percent of gross sales \"placed us at the bottom of a low-paying industry,\" Cal Turner Jr., the son of Dollar General's founder, told ProPublica.\nPerdue presided over a more than 30-fold increase in the number of employee lawsuits filed against the company, according to a Capital & Main review of court filings. While he worked at the firm, 2,494 individual employment cases were filed charging the company with gender and racial discrimination, rampant wage theft, failure to provide medical leave and other workplace violations. In the four years leading up to Perdue taking the helm, 76 employment cases were filed in federal court.\nThat vast increase appears largely due to more than 2,000 wage theft cases filed in 2006 by Dollar General managers who claimed they were classified as managers only so that the company could circumvent federal law, which required hourly employees to be paid overtime when working over 40 hours in a single week, according to the employees' complaints. In an effort to keep their store's payroll low, these \"managers\" were allegedly forced to work more than 70 hours a week, and sometimes up to 90 hours a week, without earning overtime, despite doing much the same work as hourly employees. The plaintiffs sought to be represented collectively in a lawsuit that claimed they were misclassified as managers, but the court eventually required that the cases be filed individually, according to Mark Petro, an Alabama-based attorney involved in the effort.\nTaken together, the lawsuits filed during Perdue's tenure paint a portrait of a chain that is alleged to have put extraordinary pressure on its workforce, and that is alleged to have operated in such a way to limit opportunity for Black and women employees. Meanwhile, Perdue prospered greatly, receiving tens of millions of dollars in compensation from the chain, even as profits declined under his management.\nDollar General and Perdue did not respond to repeated Capital & Main requests for comment on this story.\nPerdue stepped in to run the family-owned business following a brief, unsuccessful attempt to revive Dallas-based textile company Pillowtex, in part by outsourcing that company's manufacturing jobs. Perdue would later acknowledge one of his greatest areas of expertise at a deposition connected to the company's bankruptcy filing: \"Yeah, I spent most of my career doing that,\" he said in response to a question about outsourcing, according to a transcript obtained by Politico. The company's demise led to the loss of 7,600 jobs. Asked later about that quote, Purdue had this to say: \"Defend it? I'm proud of it,\" he said at a 2014 press appearance. \"This is a part of American business, part of any business. Outsourcing is the procurement of products and services to help your business run. People do that all day.\"\nPerdue also ramped up outsourcing at Dollar General, increasing imports from China, as the Intercept has reported. In addition, he pursued a strategy of aggressive expansion, increasing the number of Dollar General stores by almost 30% to 8,205 during his time there.\nThe immense pressure allegedly placed on managers to keep payrolls low may have affected those they supervised. Hourly employees reported they were forced to work \"off the clock\" and had their pay records altered, according to a separate wage theft lawsuit filed in New York District Court in 2006. The court denied the hourly employees' request to be considered as a class in 2011 but settled the cases of 26 of the plaintiffs individually in 2013, according to court records. Attorneys who represented the thousands of Dollar General managers who say they suffered from wage theft would not comment on the resolution of those cases.\nDeKalb County Commissioner Lorraine Cochran-Johnson has a problem with the way chains like Dollar General have proliferated in the poorer pockets of her county, which includes parts of Atlanta. She's spoken to family grocery store owners who refuse to locate near Dollar General stores because they are unable to compete with their low prices, and she has seen firsthand how thinly staffed dollar stores contribute to theft. She was surprised when Sen. Perdue began touting his leadership at Dollar General in his campaign for Senate.\n\"You go into a community that already has challenges, and you are committed to paying the lowest wage possible, hiring the least amount of people,\" she says. \"But is that something to be proud of?\" Cochran-Johnson has spearheaded a temporary countywide ban on \"small-box discount stores\" like Dollar General and Family Dollar.\nWhile allegations of wage theft, low pay and gender discrimination during Perdue's tenure as CEO of Dollar General have previously been reported, Capital & Main has uncovered new evidence of allegedly discriminatory practices at the company while Perdue was at the helm, including those that singled out pregnant women and African-Americans.

She was the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee under U.S. senator John McCain.\nPalin was elected to the Wasilla city council in 1992 and became mayor of Wasilla in 1996. In 2003, after an unsuccessful run for lieutenant governor, she was appointed chair of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, responsible for overseeing the state's oil and gas fields for safety and efficiency. In 2006, at age 42, she became the youngest person and the first woman to be elected governor of Alaska.[1] Immense legal fees incurred by both Palin and the state of Alaska from her fights against ethics investigations led to her resignation in 2009.[2]\nPalin was nominated as John McCain's vice presidential running mate at the 2008 Republican National Convention. She was the first Republican female vice presidential nominee and the second female vice presidential nominee of a major party, after Geraldine Ferraro in 1984. The McCain-Palin ticket subsequently lost the 2008 election to the Democratic Party's then-U.S. senators Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Throughout the race, her public image and experience came under media attention. Although her vice presidential bid alongside McCain was unsuccessful, the 2008 presidential election significantly raised Palin's national profile.\nSince her resignation as governor in 2009, she has campaigned for the fiscally conservative Tea Party movement. In addition, she has publicly endorsed several candidates in multiple election cycles, including Donald Trump in his 2016 presidential campaign. She has also led a career as a television personality. From 2010 to 2015, she provided political commentary for Fox News.[3] She hosted TLC's Sarah Palin's Alaska in 2010–11 and Amazing America with Sarah Palin on the Sportsman Channel in 2014–15.[4][5] From 2014 to 2015, she oversaw a short-lived subscriber-based online TV channel, the Sarah Palin Channel, via TAPP TV.[6][7] Her personal memoir, Going Rogue, written following the 2008 election, sold more than one million copies.\nIn 2022, Palin ran in the special election for Alaska's at-large congressional seat that was vacated after the death of Representative Don Young,[8] but lost to Democrat Mary Peltola, who completed Young's unfinished term.[9] Palin faced Peltola and others again in the November general election for the same seat, and again lost to Peltola, who won re-election to serve a full two-year term.\nEarly life and education\nPalin was born in Sandpoint, Idaho, the third of four children (three daughters and one son) of Sarah \"Sally\" Heath (née Sheeran; 1940–2021),[10] a school secretary, and Charles R. \"Chuck\" Heath (born 1938), a science teacher and track-and-field coach. Palin's siblings are Chuck Jr., Heather, and Molly.[11][12][13][14] Palin is of English, Irish, and German ancestry.[15]\nWhen Palin was a few months old, the family moved to Skagway, Alaska,[16] where her father had been hired to teach.[17] They relocated to Eagle River, Anchorage in 1969, and settled in Wasilla, Alaska, in 1972.[18][19]\nPalin played flute in the junior high band. She attended Wasilla High School, where she was head of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes[20] and a member of the girls' basketball and cross-country running teams.[21] During her senior year, she was co-captain and point guard of the basketball team that won the 1982 Alaska state championship, earning the nickname \"Sarah Barracuda\" for her competitive streak.[22][23][24]\nIn 1984, Palin won the Miss Wasilla beauty pageant;[25] she finished third (as second runner-up) in the Miss Alaska pageant, where she won the title of \"Miss Congeniality\".[26][27][28] She played the flute in the talent portion of the contest.[29] Though one author reported that she received the Miss Congeniality award in the Miss Wasilla contest, this was disputed by another contestant and classmate of Palin's.[25] She received a college scholarship.[22]\nAfter graduating from high school in 1982, Palin enrolled at the University of Hawaii at Hilo.[30] Shortly after arriving in Hawaii, Palin transferred to Hawaii Pacific University in Honolulu for a semester in the fall of 1982. She returned to the mainland, enrolling at North Idaho College, a community college in Coeur d'Alene, for the spring and fall semesters of 1983.[31] She transferred and enrolled at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho, for an academic year starting in August 1984. Beginning in the fall of 1985, she attended Matanuska-Susitna College in Alaska. Palin returned to the University of Idaho in January 1986 and received her bachelor's degree in communications with an emphasis in journalism in May 1987.[31][32][33][34]\nEarly career\nAfter graduation, Palin worked as a sportscaster for KTUU-TV and KTVA-TV in Anchorage[35][36] and as a sports reporter for the Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman,[37][38] fulfilling an early ambition.[39]\nPolitical career\nPalin has been a Republican since 1982.[40]\nWasilla City Council\nPalin was elected to the Wasilla City Council in 1992, winning by a margin of 530 votes to 310.[41][42]\nMayor of Wasilla\nConcerned that revenue from a new Wasilla sales tax would not be spent wisely,[43] Palin ran for mayor of Wasilla in 1996, defeating incumbent mayor John Stein[44] by a 651–440 margin.[45] Her biographer described her campaign as targeting wasteful spending and high taxes;[22] her opponent, Stein, said that Palin introduced abortion, gun rights, and term limits as campaign issues.[46] The election was nonpartisan, though the state Republican Party ran advertisements for Palin.[46] She ran for reelection against Stein in 1999 and won, 909 votes to 292.[47] In 2002, she completed the second of the two consecutive three-year terms allowed by the city charter.[48] She was elected president of the Alaska Conference of Mayors in 1999.[49]\nFirst term\nUsing revenue generated by a 2% sales tax, which had been approved by Wasilla voters in October 1992,[50][51] Palin cut property taxes by 75% and eliminated personal property and business inventory taxes.[52][53] Using municipal bonds, she made improvements to the roads and sewers and increased funding to the police department.[46] She oversaw creation of new bike paths and procured funding for storm-water treatment to protect freshwater resources. At the same time, she reduced the budget of the local museum and postponed discussions about a new library and city hall, which some of the council believed was needed.[52]\nSoon after taking office in October 1996, Palin eliminated the position of museum director.[54] She asked for updated resumes and resignation letters from \"city department heads who had been loyal to Stein\", although the mayor's office was considered a non-partisan position.[55] These included the city police chief, public works director, finance director, and librarian.[56] Palin stated this request was to find out their intentions and whether they supported her. She temporarily required department heads to get her approval before talking to reporters, saying they needed to learn her administration's policies.[56] She created the position of city administrator[46] and reduced her own $68,000 salary by 10%. By mid 1998 this action was reversed by the city council.[57]\nIn October 1996, Palin asked library director Mary Ellen Emmons if she would object to the removal of a book from the library if people were picketing to have the book removed.[58] Emmons responded that she would, and others as well.[58] Palin stated that she had not been proposing censorship but had been discussing many issues with her staff that were \"both rhetorical and realistic in nature.\"[58] No attempt was made to remove books from the library during Palin's tenure as mayor.[59]\nPalin said she fired Police Chief Irl Stambaugh because he did not fully support her efforts to govern the city.[60] Stambaugh filed a lawsuit alleging wrongful termination and violation of his free speech rights.[61] The judge dismissed Stambaugh's lawsuit, holding that the police chief served at the discretion of the mayor and could be terminated for nearly any reason, even a political one,[62][63] and ordered Stambaugh to pay Palin's legal fees.[62]\nSecond term\nDuring her second term as mayor, Palin proposed and promoted the construction of a municipal sports center to be financed by a 0.5%[46] sales tax increase and a $14.7 million bond issue.[64] Voters approved the measure by a 20-vote margin, and the Wasilla Multi-Use Sports Complex (later named the Curtis D. Menard Memorial Sports Center) was built on time and under budget. However, the city spent an additional $1.3 million because of an eminent domain lawsuit caused by the city's failure to obtain clear title to the property before beginning construction.[64] The city's long-term debt grew from about $1 million to $25 million because of expenditures of $15 million for the sports complex, $5.5 million for street projects, and $3 million for water improvement projects. The Wall Street Journal characterized the project as a \"financial mess.\"[64] A city council member defended the spending increases as being necessitated by the city's growth during that time.[65]\nPalin also joined with nearby communities in hiring the Anchorage-based lobbying firm of Robertson, Monagle & Eastaugh to lobby for federal funds. The firm secured nearly $8 million in earmarks for the Wasilla city government,[66] including $500,000 for a youth shelter, $1.9 million for a transportation hub, and $900,000 for sewer repairs.[67] In 2008, Wasilla's current mayor credited Palin's 75 percent property tax cuts and infrastructure improvements with bringing \"big-box stores\" and 50,000 shoppers per day to Wasilla.[41]\nTerm limits prevented Palin from seeking a third term in 2002. Palin endorsed Dianne Keller in the election to succeed her.[68] Keller won, defeating three opponents,[69] including Faye Palin (Palin's mother-in-law, the stepmother of Palin's husband).[68]\nState politics\nIn 2002, Palin ran for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor, coming in second to Loren Leman in a five-way Republican primary.[70] Following her defeat, she campaigned throughout the state for the nominated Republican governor-lieutenant governor ticket of Frank Murkowski and Leman.[71] Murkowski and Leman won and Murkowski resigned from his long-held U.S. Senate seat in December 2002 to assume the governorship. Palin was said to be on the \"short list\" of possible appointees to Murkowski's U.S. Senate seat,[71] but Murkowski ultimately appointed his daughter, state representative Lisa Murkowski, as his successor in the Senate.[72]\nGovernor Murkowski offered other jobs to Palin and, in February 2003, she accepted an appointment to the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which oversees Alaska's oil and gas fields for safety and efficiency.[71] While she had little background in the area, she said she wanted to learn more about the oil industry and was named chair of the commission and ethics supervisor.[71][73][74] By November 2003, she was filing nonpublic ethics complaints with the state attorney general and the governor against a fellow commission member, Randy Ruedrich, a former petroleum engineer and at the time the chair of the state Republican Party.[71] He was forced to resign in November 2003.[71] Palin resigned in January 2004 and put her protests against Ruedrich's \"lack of ethics\" into the public arena[22][71] by filing a public complaint against Ruedrich,[75] who was then fined $12,000. She joined with Democratic legislator Eric Croft[76] in complaining that Gregg Renkes, then the attorney general of Alaska,[77] had a financial conflict of interest in negotiating a coal exporting trade agreement.[78][79] Renkes also resigned his post.[22][74]\nFrom 2003 to June 2005, Palin served as one of three directors of \"Ted Stevens Excellence in Public Service, Inc.,\" a 527 group designed to provide political training for Republican women in Alaska.[80] In 2004, Palin told the Anchorage Daily News that she had decided not to run for the U.S. Senate that year against the Republican incumbent, Lisa Murkowski, because her teenage son opposed it. Palin said, \"How could I be the team mom if I was a U.S. Senator?\"[81]\nGovernor of Alaska\nIn 2006, running on a clean-government platform, Palin defeated incumbent governor Frank Murkowski in the Republican gubernatorial primary.[82][83] Her running mate was State Senator Sean Parnell.[84]\nIn the November election, Palin was outspent but victorious, defeating former Democratic governor Tony Knowles 48.3% to 41.0%.[22] She became Alaska's first female governor and, at the age of 42, the youngest governor in Alaskan history. She was the state's first governor to have been born after Alaska achieved U.S. statehood, and the first who was not inaugurated in the capital, Juneau (she chose to have the ceremony in Fairbanks instead).\nShe took office on December 4, 2006. For most of her term, she was very popular with Alaska voters. Polls taken in 2007 showed her with 93% and 89% popularity among all voters.[85] The Anchorage Daily News and The Weekly Standard called her \"the most popular governor in America.\"[76][85] A poll taken in late September 2008, after Palin was named to the national Republican ticket, showed her popularity in Alaska at 68%.[86] A poll taken in May 2009 indicated Palin's popularity among Alaskans had declined to 54% positive and 41.6% negative.[87]\nPalin declared that top priorities of her administration would be resource development, education and workforce development, public health and safety, and transportation and infrastructure development.[1] She had championed ethics reform throughout her election campaign. Her first legislative action after taking office was to push for a bipartisan ethics reform bill. She signed the resulting legislation in July 2007, calling it a \"first step\" and declaring that she remained determined to clean up Alaska politics.[88]\nPalin frequently broke with the Alaskan Republican establishment.[89][90] For example, she endorsed Parnell's bid to unseat Don Young, the state's longtime at-large U.S. representative.[91] She publicly challenged then-U.S. Senator Ted Stevens to \"come clean\" about the federal investigation into his financial dealings. She promoted the development of oil and natural-gas resources in Alaska, including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Proposals to drill for oil in ANWR have catalyzed national debate.[92]\nIn 2006, Palin obtained a passport.[93] In 2007, she traveled to Kuwait, where she visited the Khabari Alawazem Crossing at the Kuwait–Iraq border and met with members of the Alaska National Guard.[94] On her return journey, she visited injured soldiers in Germany.[95]\nBudget, spending, and federal funds\nIn June 2007, Palin signed a record $6.6 billion operating budget into law.[96] At the same time, she used her veto power to make the second-largest cuts of the capital budget in state history. The $237 million in cuts represented over 300 local projects and reduced the capital budget to $1.6 billion.[97]\nIn 2008, Palin vetoed $286 million, cutting or reducing funding for 350 projects from the FY09 capital budget.[98]\nPalin followed through on a campaign promise to sell the Westwind II jet, a purchase made by the Murkowski administration for $2.7 million in 2005 against the wishes of the legislature.[99] In August 2007, the jet was listed on eBay, but the sale fell through, and the plane later sold for $2.1 million through a private brokerage firm.[100]\nGubernatorial expenditures\nPalin lived in Juneau during the legislative session, and lived in Wasilla and worked out of offices in Anchorage the rest of the year. Since the office in Anchorage was 565 miles from Juneau, while she worked there, state officials said she was permitted to claim a $58 per diem travel allowance and reimbursement for hotel. She filed for per diem, claiming a total of $16,951, but rather than stay at a hotel overnight, regularly commuted the 50 miles one way to her home in Wasilla.[101] She did not use the former governor's private chef.[102]\nBoth Republicans and Democrats criticized Palin for taking the per diem, as well as an additional $43,490 in travel expenses on occasions when her family accompanied her on state business.[103][104] Palin's staffers responded that these practices were in line with state policy, that her gubernatorial expenses were 80% below those of her predecessor Murkowski,[103] and that \"many of the hundreds of invitations Palin receives include requests for her to bring her family, placing the definition of 'state business' with the party extending the invitation.\"[101]\nIn February 2009, the State of Alaska, reversing a policy that had treated the payments as legitimate business expenses under the Internal Revenue Code, decided that per diems paid to state employees for stays in their own homes would be treated as taxable income and will be included in employees' gross income on their W-2 forms.[105] Palin had ordered the review of the tax policy.[106]\nIn December 2008, an Alaska state commission recommended increasing the governor's annual salary from $125,000 to $150,000. Palin said that she would not accept the pay raise.[107] In response, the commission dropped the recommendation.[108]\nFederal funding\nIn her State of the State address on January 17, 2008, Palin declared that the people of Alaska \"can and must continue to develop our economy, because we cannot and must not rely so heavily on federal government [funding].\"[109] Alaska's federal congressional representatives cut back on pork-barrel project requests during Palin's time as governor.[110]\nWhile the state has no sales tax or income tax, royalty revenues from the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field (consisting mostly of state-owned lands) have supported large state budgets since 1980. The exact amounts have depended on the prevailing price of petroleum. As a result, state revenues doubled to $10 billion in 2008. Despite this, for the 2009 state budget, Palin gave a list of 31 proposed federal earmarks or requests for funding, totaling $197 million, to Alaska's senior U.S. senator Ted Stevens. This was a major decrease from earlier years.[111][112] Palin has said that her decreasing support for federal funding was a source of friction between her and the state's congressional delegation; Palin requested less in federal funding each year than her predecessor Frank Murkowski requested in his last year.[113]\nBridge to Nowhere\nIn 2002, it was proposed that a for-profit prison corporation, Cornell Corrections, build a prison on Gravina Island. To connect Gravina with nearby Ketchikan, on Revillagigedo Island, it was originally planned that the federal government spend $175 million on building a bridge and another $75 million to connect it to the power grid with an electrical intertie. The Ketchikan Borough Assembly turned the proposal down when the administration of Governor Tony Knowles also expressed its disfavor with the idea. Eventually, the corporation's prison plans led to the exposure of the wide-ranging Alaska political corruption probe, which eventually ensnared Alaska's U.S. senator Ted Stevens. The bridge idea persisted through the administration of former U.S. senator and then-governor Frank Murkowski. The 2005 Highway Bill provided for $223m to build the Gravina Island Bridge. The provisions and earmarks[114] were negotiated by Alaska's Rep. Don Young, who chaired the House Transportation Committee, and were supported by the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Ted Stevens.[115] This bridge, nicknamed \"The Bridge to Nowhere\" by critics, was intended to replace the auto ferry that is currently the only connection between Ketchikan and its airport. While the federal earmark was withdrawn after meeting opposition from Oklahoma senator Tom Coburn, the state of Alaska still received $300 million in transportation funding,[115] with which the state of Alaska continued to study improvements in access to the airport, which conceivably could include improvements to the ferry service.[116] In 2006, Palin had run for governor with a \"build-the-bridge\" plank in her platform,[117] saying she would \"not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project ... into something that's so negative.\"[118] Palin criticized the use of the word \"nowhere\" as insulting to local residents[117][119] and urged speedy work on building the infrastructure \"while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist.\"[119] Despite the demise of the bridge proposal, Palin spent $26 million in transportation funding for the planned 3-mile access road on Gravina island that ultimately had little use.[120][121] A spokesman for Alaska's Department of Transportation said that it had been within Palin's power to cancel the road project but noted the state was considering cheaper designs to complete the bridge project, and that in any case the road would open up the surrounding lands for development.[117][122] As governor, Palin canceled the Gravina Island Bridge in September 2007, saying that Congress had \"little interest in spending any more money\" due to \"inaccurate portrayals of the projects.\"[123] Alaska did not return the $442 million in federal transportation funds.[124]\nIn 2008, as a candidate for vice president, Palin characterized her position as having told Congress \"thanks, but no thanks, on that bridge to nowhere.\" A number of Ketchikan residents said that the claim was false and a betrayal of Palin's previous support for their community.[124] Some critics said that her statement was misleading, as she had expressed support for the spending project and kept the federal money after the project was canceled.[125]\nGas pipeline\nIn August 2008, Palin signed a bill authorizing the State of Alaska to award TransCanada Pipelines—the sole bidder to meet the state's requirements—a license to build and operate a pipeline to transport natural gas from the Alaska North Slope to the continental United States through Canada.[126] The governor also pledged $500 million in seed money to support the project.[127]\nIt was estimated that the project would cost $26 billion.[126] Newsweek described the project as \"the principal achievement of Sarah Palin's term as Alaska's governor.\"[128] The pipeline also faces legal challenges from Canadian First Nations.[128]\nPredator control\nIn 2007, Palin supported a 2003 Alaska Department of Fish and Game policy allowing the hunting of wolves from the air as part of a predator control program intended to increase moose and caribou populations for subsistence-food gatherers and other hunters.[129][130] In March 2007, the department offered a bounty of $150 per wolf would be paid to the 180 volunteer pilots and gunners in five areas of Alaska to offset fuel costs. In the preceding four years, 607 wolves had been killed. State biologists wanted 382 to 664 wolves to be killed by the end of the predator-control season in April 2007. Wildlife activists sued the state- A state judge declared the bounty illegal on the basis that a bounty would have to be offered by the Board of Game and not by the Department of Fish and Game.[129][131] On August 26, 2008, Alaskans voted against ending the state's predator control program.[132]\nPublic Safety Commissioner dismissal\nPalin dismissed Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan on July 11, 2008, citing performance-related issues, such as not being \"a team player on budgeting issues\"[133] and \"egregious rogue behavior.\"[134] Palin attorney Thomas Van Flein said that the \"last straw\" was Monegan's planned trip to Washington, D.C., to seek funding for a new, multimillion-dollar sexual assault initiative the governor hadn't yet approved.[135]\nMonegan said that he had resisted persistent pressure from Palin, her husband, and her staff, including state attorney general Talis J. Colberg, to fire Palin's ex-brother-in-law, Alaska state trooper Mike Wooten; Wooten was involved in a child custody battle with Palin's sister after a bitter divorce that included an alleged death threat against Palin's father.[136][137] At one point Sarah and Todd Palin hired a private investigator to gather information, seeking to have Wooten officially disciplined.[138] Monegan stated that he learned an internal investigation had found all but two of the allegations to be unsubstantiated, and Wooten had been disciplined for the others – an illegal moose killing and the tasering of his 11-year-old stepson, who had reportedly asked to be tasered.[137] He told the Palins that there was nothing he could do because the matter was closed.[139] When contacted by the press for comment, Monegan first acknowledged pressure to fire Wooten but said that he could not be certain that his own firing was connected to that issue;[137] he later asserted that the dispute over Wooten was a major reason for his firing.[140] Palin stated on July 17 that Monegan was not pressured to fire Wooten, nor dismissed for not doing so.[133][139]\nMonegan said the subject of Wooten came up when he invited Palin to a birthday party for his cousin, state senator Lyman Hoffman, in February 2007 during the legislative session in Juneau. \"As we were walking down the stairs in the capitol building she wanted to talk to me about her former brother-in-law,\" Monegan said. \"I said, 'Ma'am, I need to keep you at arm's length with this. I can't deal about him with you.[141] She said, 'OK, that's a good idea.'\"[137]\nPalin said there was \"absolutely no pressure ever put on Commissioner Monegan to hire or fire anybody, at any time. I did not abuse my office powers. And I don't know how to be more blunt and candid and honest, but to tell you that truth. To tell you that no pressure was ever put on anybody to fire anybody.\" Todd Palin gave a similar account.[142]\nOn August 13, she acknowledged that a half dozen members of her administration had made more than two dozen calls on the matter to various state officials. \"I do now have to tell Alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist, although I have only now become aware of it\", she said.[139][141][143] Palin said, \"Many of these inquiries were completely appropriate. However, the serial nature of the contacts could be perceived as some kind of pressure, presumably at my direction.\"[133][144]\nChuck Kopp, whom Palin had appointed to replace Monegan as public safety commissioner, received a $10,000 state severance package after he resigned following just two weeks on the job. Kopp, the former Kenai chief of police, resigned July 25 following disclosure of a 2005 sexual harassment complaint and letter of reprimand against him. Monegan said that he did not receive a severance package from the state.[133]\nLegislative investigation\nOn August 1, 2008, the Alaska Legislature hired an investigator, Stephen Branchflower, to review the Monegan dismissal. Legislators stated that Palin had the legal authority to fire Monegan, but they wanted to know whether her action had been motivated by anger at Monegan for not firing Wooten.[145] The atmosphere was bipartisan and Palin pledged to cooperate.[145][146] Wooten remained employed as a state trooper.[138] She placed an aide on paid leave due to a tape-recorded phone conversation that she deemed improper, in which the aide, appearing to act on her behalf, complained to a trooper that Wooten had not been fired.[147]\nSeveral weeks after the start of what the media referred to as \"troopergate\", Palin was chosen as John McCain's running mate.[145] On September 1, Palin asked the legislature to drop its investigation, saying that the state Personnel Board had jurisdiction over ethics issues.[148] The Personnel Board's three members were first appointed by Palin's predecessor, and Palin reappointed one member in 2008.[149] On September 19, Todd Palin and several state employees refused to honor subpoenas, the validity of which were disputed by Talis Colberg, Palin's appointee as Alaska's attorney general.[150] On October 2, a court rejected Colberg's challenge to the subpoenas,[151] and seven of the witnesses, not including Todd Palin, eventually testified.[152]\nBranchflower Report\nOn October 10, 2008, the Alaska Legislative Council unanimously voted to release, without endorsing,[153] the Branchflower Report, in which investigator Stephen Branchflower found that firing Monegan \"was a proper and lawful exercise of her constitutional and statutory authority,\" but that Palin abused her power as governor and violated the state's Executive Branch Ethics Act when her office pressured Monegan to fire Wooten.[154] The report stated that \"Governor Palin knowingly permitted a situation to continue where impermissible pressure was placed on several subordinates to advance a personal agenda, to wit: to get Trooper Michael Wooten fired.\"[155] The report also said that Palin \"permitted Todd Palin to use the Governor's office [...] to continue to contact subordinate state employees in an effort to find some way to get Trooper Wooten fired.\"[155][156]\nPalin's attorneys condemned the Branchflower Report as \"misleading and wrong on the law\"[157] and an attempt to \"smear the governor by innuendo.\"[158] The day after the report was released, Palin said she was \"very, very pleased to be cleared of any legal wrongdoing\" or \"any kind of unethical activity.\"[159]\nAlaska Personnel Board investigation and report\nThe bipartisan State of Alaska Personnel Board reviewed the matter at Palin's request.[160] On September 15, the Anchorage law firm of Clapp, Peterson, Van Flein, Tiemessen & Thorsness filed arguments of \"no probable cause\" with the Personnel Board on behalf of Palin.[161][162] The Personnel Board retained independent counsel Timothy Petumenos as an investigator. On October 24, Palin gave three hours of depositions with the Personnel Board in St. Louis, Missouri.[163] On November 3, 2008, the State of Alaska Personnel Board reported that there was no probable cause to believe that Palin or any other state official had violated state ethical standards.[164][165][166][167][168] The report further stated that the Branchflower Report used the wrong statute in reaching its conclusions, misconstrued the available evidence and did not consider or obtain all of the material evidence required to properly reach findings in the matter.[164]\nJob approval ratings\nAs governor of Alaska, Palin's job approval rating ranged from a high of 93% in May 2007 to a low of 54% in May 2009.[169]\n| Date | Approval | Disapproval | Pollster |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| May 15, 2007[170] | 93% | Not reported | Dittman Research |\n| May 30, 2007[citation needed] | 89% | Not reported | Ivan Moore Research |\n| October 19–21, 2007[171] | 83% | 11% | Ivan Moore Research |\n| April 10, 2008[172] | 73% | 7% | Rasmussen Reports |\n| May 17, 2008[173] | 69% | 9% | Rasmussen Reports |\n| July 24–25, 2008[174] | 80% | Not reported | Hays Research Group |\n| July 30, 2008[174] | 64% | 14% | Rasmussen Reports |\n| September 20–22, 2008[175] | 68% | Not reported | Ivan Moore Research |\n| October 7, 2008[176] | 63% | 37% | Rasmussen Reports |\n| March 24–25, 2009[177] | 59.8% | 34.9% | Hays Research |\n| May 4–5, 2009[177] | 54% | 41.6% | Hays Research |\n| June 14–18, 2009[178] | 56% | 35% | Global Strategy Group |\nResignation\nOn July 3, 2009, Palin announced that she would not run for reelection in the 2010 Alaska gubernatorial election and would resign before the end of the month. Palin stated that since August 2008, both she and the state had been spending an \"insane\" amount of time and money ($2.5 million) responding to \"opposition research\", 150 FOIA requests and 15 \"frivolous\" legal ethics complaints filed by \"political operatives\" against her.[179][180][181] She said her resignation was also influenced by her desire not to be a lame duck.[181]\nLieutenant Governor Sean Parnell said that Palin's decision to resign was driven by the high cost of legal fees against ethics investigations; Palin and her husband Todd personally incurred more than $500,000 in legal expenses.[179] Parnell became governor on July 26, 2009, in an inaugural ceremony in Fairbanks upon Palin's resignation taking effect.[182]\nIn December 2010, new rules governing Alaska executive branch ethics, stemming from Palin's tenure as governor, took effect.[183] \"These include allowing for the state to pay legal costs for officials cleared of ethics violations; (and) allowing for a family member of the governor or lieutenant governor to travel at state cost in certain circumstances ...\"[183]\n2008 vice presidential campaign\nSeveral conservative commentators met Palin in the summer of 2007.[184] Some of them, such as Bill Kristol, later urged McCain to pick Palin as his vice presidential running mate, arguing that her presence on the ticket would provide a boost in enthusiasm among the Religious Right wing of the Republican party, while her status as an unknown on the national scene would also be a positive factor.[185]\nOn August 24, 2008, Steve Schmidt and a few other senior McCain campaign advisers discussed potential vice presidential picks with the consensus settling around Palin. The following day, the strategists advised McCain of their conclusions and McCain personally called Palin, who was at the Alaska State Fair.[186]\nOn August 27, Palin visited McCain's vacation home near Sedona, Arizona, where she was offered the position of vice-presidential candidate.[187] According to Jill Hazelbaker, a spokeswoman for McCain, he had previously met Palin at the National Governors Association meeting in Washington in February 2008 and had come away \"extraordinarily impressed.\"[188] Palin was the only prospective running mate who had a face-to-face interview with McCain to discuss joining the ticket that week.[189] Nonetheless, Palin's selection was a surprise to many because a main criticism he had of Obama was his lack of experience, and speculation had centered on other candidates, such as Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty, Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, U.S. senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, and former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge.[190] On August 29, in Dayton, Ohio, McCain introduced Palin as his running mate,[190] making her the first Alaskan and the second woman to run on a major U.S. party ticket.[190]\nPalin was largely unknown outside Alaska before her selection by McCain.[191] On September 1, 2008, Palin revealed that her daughter Bristol was pregnant and that she would marry the child's father, Levi Johnston.[192] During this period, some Republicans felt that Palin was being unfairly attacked by the media.[193] Timothy Noah of Slate magazine predicted that Palin's acceptance speech would be \"wildly overpraised\" and might end speculation that she was unqualified for the job of vice president because the press had been beating her up for \"various trivial shortcomings\" and had lowered the expectations for her speech.[194] On September 3, 2008, Palin delivered a 40-minute acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention that was well received and watched by more than 40 million people.[195] Wall Street Journal writer Thomas Frank noted the irony in her unattributed quoting of right-wing faux populist Westbrook Pegler's treacly, \"We grow good people in our small towns, with honesty and sincerity and dignity.\"[196]\nDuring the campaign, controversy erupted over alleged differences between Palin's positions as a gubernatorial candidate and her position as a vice-presidential candidate. After McCain introduced Palin as his running mate, Newsweek and Time put Palin on their magazine covers,[197] as some of the media alleged that McCain's campaign was restricting press access to Palin by allowing only three one-on-one interviews and no press conferences with her.[198] Palin's first major interview, with Charles Gibson of ABC News, met with mixed reviews.[199] Her interview five days later with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity went more smoothly and focused on many of the same questions from Gibson's interview.[200] Palin's performance in her third interview with Katie Couric, of CBS News, was widely criticized; her poll numbers declined, Republicans expressed concern that she was becoming a political liability, and some conservative commentators called for Palin to resign from the Presidential ticket.[201][202] Other conservatives remained ardent in their support for Palin, accusing the columnists of elitism.[203] Following this interview, some Republicans, including Mitt Romney and Bill Kristol, questioned the McCain campaign's strategy of sheltering Palin from unscripted encounters with the press.[204]\nPalin reportedly prepared intensively for the October 2 vice-presidential debate with Democratic vice-presidential nominee Joe Biden at Washington University in St. Louis. Some Republicans suggested that Palin's performance in the interviews would improve public perceptions of her debate performance by lowering expectations.[201][205][206] Polling from CNN, Fox and CBS found that while Palin exceeded most voters' expectations, they felt that Biden had won the debate.[207][208]\nUpon returning to the campaign trail after her debate preparation, Palin stepped up her attacks on the Democratic candidate for president, Illinois senator Barack Obama. At a fundraising event, Palin explained her new aggressiveness, saying, \"There does come a time when you have to take the gloves off and that time is right now.\"[209] Palin said that her first amendment right to \"call Obama out on his associations\" was threatened by \"attacks by the mainstream media.\"[210]\nPalin appeared on Saturday Night Live's \"Weekend Update\" segment on October 18. Prior to her appearance, she had been memorably parodied several times by SNL cast member Tina Fey, who was noted for her physical resemblance to the candidate.[211] In the weeks leading up to the election, Palin was also the subject of amateur parodies posted on YouTube.[212]\nControversy arose after it was reported that the Republican National Committee (RNC) spent $150,000 of campaign contributions on clothing, hair styling, and makeup for Palin and her family in September 2008. Campaign spokespersons stated the clothing would be going to charity after the election.[213] Palin and some media outlets blamed gender bias for the controversy.[214][215] At the end of the campaign, Palin returned the clothes to the RNC.[216]\nThe election took place on November 4, and Obama was projected as the winner at 11:00 PM EST.[217] In his concession speech McCain thanked Palin, calling her \"one of the best campaigners I've ever seen, and an impressive new voice in our party for reform and the principles that have always been our greatest strength.\"[217] While aides were preparing the teleprompter for McCain's speech, they found a concession speech written for Palin by George W. Bush speechwriter Matthew Scully. Two members of McCain's staff, Steve Schmidt and Mark Salter, told Palin that there was no tradition of Election Night speeches by running mates, and that she would not be speaking. Palin appealed to McCain, who agreed with his staff.[218]\nPolitical scientists have debated the impact that Palin had on the outcome of the 2008 presidential election.[219][220] A 2010 study in the journal Electoral Studies found that \"her campaign performance cost McCain just under 2% of the final vote share.\"[219] However, a 2013 study in the journal Political Research Quarterly failed to find an adverse impact.[220]\nPost-2008 election\nPalin was the first guest on commentator Glenn Beck's Fox News television show on January 19, 2009, commenting on Barack Obama that he would be her president and that she would assist in any way to bring progress to the nation without abandoning her conservative views.[221]\nIn August 2009, she coined the phrase \"death panel\", to describe rationing of care as part of the proposed health care reform. She stated that it would require Americans such as her parents or her child with Down syndrome, \"to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care.\"[222] The phrase was criticized by many Democrats and Politifact named it the \"Lie of the Year of 2009.\"[223] However, conservatives disputed this and defended her use of the term.[224]\nIn March 2010, Palin started a show to be aired on TLC called Sarah Palin's Alaska.[225] The show was produced by Mark Burnett.[226] Five million viewers tuned in for the premiere episode, a record for TLC.[227] Palin also secured a segment on Fox News.[226] Two guests that she was shown to have interviewed claimed to have never met her. Guests LL Cool J and Toby Keith stated that footage shown on the segment was actually taken from another interview with someone else, but was used in Palin's segment.[228] Fox News and Palin ended this relationship in January 2013.[229] But on June 13, 2013, Palin rejoined Fox News Channel as an analyst.[230]\nOn December 8, 2010, it was reported that SarahPAC and Palin's personal credit card information were compromised through cyber attacks. Palin's team believed the attack was executed by Anonymous during Operation Payback.[231] The report was met with skepticism in the blogosphere.[232] Palin's email had been hacked once before in 2008.[233]\nSarahPAC\nOn January 27, 2009, Palin formed the political action committee, SarahPAC.[234][235] Michael Glassner, a former aide to Palin, was appointed as the chief of staff of SarahPAC.[236] The organization, which describes itself as an advocate of energy independence,[237] supports candidates for federal and state office.[238] Following her resignation as governor, Palin stated her intention to campaign \"on behalf of candidates who believe in the right things, regardless of their party label or affiliation.\"[239] It was reported that SarahPAC had raised nearly $1,000,000.[240] A legal defense fund was set up to help Palin challenge ethics complaints, and it had collected approximately $250,000 by mid July 2009.[240][241] In June 2010, Palin's defense fund was ruled illegal and was required to pay back $386,856 it collected in donations because it used Palin's position as governor to raise money for her personal gain. Palin subsequently set up a new defense fund.[242] Sarah PAC was terminated as of December 31, 2016.[243]\nIn the wake of the January 8, 2011, shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, Palin faced criticism for her SarahPAC website's inclusion of a political graphic that included a crosshair[244] over Giffords's district. Palin responded on her Facebook page to the criticism, saying, \"Acts of monstrous criminality stand on their own. They begin and end with the criminals who commit them\", equating the accusations of her role in the shooting to a \"blood libel\".[245][246][247]\nGoing Rogue and America by Heart\nIn November 2009, Palin released her memoir, Going Rogue: An American Life, in which she details her private and political career, including her resignation as Governor of Alaska. Palin said she took the title from the phrase 'gone rogue' used by McCain staffers to describe her behavior when she spoke her mind on the issues during the campaign.[248] The subtitle, \"An American Life,\" mirrors the title of President Ronald Reagan's 1990 autobiography.[249] Less than two weeks after its release, sales of the book exceeded the one million mark, with 300,000 copies sold the first day. Its bestseller rankings were comparable to memoirs by Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.[250][251][252]\nPalin traveled to 11 states in a bus, with her family accompanying her, to promote the book. She made a number of media appearances as well, including a widely publicized interview on November 16, 2009, with Oprah Winfrey.[253] In November 2010 HarperCollins released Palin's second book, titled America by Heart.[254][255][256] The book contains excerpts from Palin's favorite speeches, sermons and literature as well as portraits of people Palin admires, including some she met in rural America on her first book tour.[254]\nTea Party movement\nOn February 6, 2010, Palin was the keynote speaker at the first Tea Party convention in Nashville, Tennessee. Palin said the Tea Party movement is \"the future of politics in America.\"[257] She criticized Obama for rising deficits, and for \"apologizing for America\" in speeches in other countries. Palin said Obama was weak on the war on terror for allowing the so-called Christmas bomber to board a plane headed for the United States.[258]\nIn 2011, Palin was the keynote speaker at an annual tax day tea party rally at the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison sponsored by Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group headquartered in Arlington, Virginia,[259] and a featured speaker at a Tea Party Express rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, at which Palin urged members of the Tea Party movement to avoid internal bickering with establishment Republicans.[260][261]\n2010 endorsements\nIn mid-2010, Palin positioned herself as a champion of conservative Republican women, calling for a \"whole stampede of pink elephants\" in the 2010 midterm elections.[262] She endorsed a number of female Republican candidates in primary elections,[263] including Karen Handel, who unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Governor of Georgia in the 2010 election.[264] After multiple Palin-endorsed candidates lost their races, a spokesman for the House Democratic campaign operation, Ryan Rudominer, called her involvement a \"great thing across the board\".[265] She spoke at a May 2010 fundraiser for the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion political advocacy group and political action committee that supports pro-life women in politics, in which she coined the term \"mama grizzly\".[266][267]\nPalin endorsed Nikki Haley for the Republican nomination for Governor of South Carolina three weeks before the election. At the time of the endorsement, Haley was polling behind three other Republicans;[268] she ended up winning the nomination[269] and the general election.[270] According to ABC News, \"pundits credited the notable endorsements of tea party groups, former state first lady Jenny Sanford, and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin with legitimizing\" Haley's candidacy \"in the face of the state's male-dominated political establishment\".[271]\nIn the months ahead of the November 2010 elections, Palin endorsed 64 Republican candidates,[272] and was a significant fundraising asset to those she campaigned for during the primary season.[273] According to Politico, Palin's criteria for endorsing candidates was whether they had the support of the Tea Party movement and the support of the Susan B. Anthony List.[274] In terms of success, Palin was 7–2 for Senate endorsements; 7–6 for House endorsements; and 6–3 in endorsements of gubernatorial candidates in races that were considered 'competitive'.[275] Palin's endorsement of Joe Miller in the August 24 Alaska primary election for U.S. Senator was identified as a pivotal moment in Miller's upset of the incumbent Republican senator Lisa Murkowski.[276][277] After losing the Republican Party primary to Miller, Murkowski ran as a write-in candidate, defeating both Miller and Democrat Scott McAdams in the general election, winning with a plurality.[278]\nAccording to The Daily Beast reporter Shushannah Walshe, Christine O'Donnell's unlikely prospects of upsetting establishment Republican candidate Mike Castle \"changed overnight\" due to Palin's endorsement. O'Donnell defeated Castle in the September 14 primary for Joe Biden's former Senate seat in Delaware.[279] Her O'Donnell endorsement further increased tensions between Palin and the Republican establishment: leading conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer described the endorsement as \"reckless and irresponsible\".[280] In 2010, former congressman and influential TV host Joe Scarborough urged his party to dissociate itself from her.[281] Party strategist Karl Rove argued that Palin's endorsement of O'Donnell may have cost the GOP the Delaware Senate seat,[282] and Politico's Ben Smith posited that Palin's support of O'Donnell helped dash Republican hopes of regaining control of the U.S. Senate.[283]\nAnother Palin endorsement carried Nevada's Sharron Angle to a 40.1% primary win,[284] in the race to beat highly endangered incumbent Senate majority leader Harry Reid. Reid prevailed 50.3% to 44.6% in the 2010 election despite losing 14 of Nevada's 17 counties.[285][286] Angle had led by as much as 11% in March and June Rasmussen polling.[287][288]\nPalin's influence over the primaries increased speculation that she would seek to be the party's nominee for president in 2012,[289] with political pundits such as David Frum and Jonathan Chait identifying Palin as the front-runner.[290][291]\n2012 election cycle and candidacy speculation\nBeginning in November 2008, following Palin's high profile in the presidential campaign, an active \"Draft Palin\" movement started.[292] On February 6, 2010, when asked on Fox News whether she would run for president in 2012, she replied, \"I would be willing to if I believe that it's right for the country.\"[293] In November 2010, Palin confirmed that she was considering running for the White House, but realized that her level of experience could make it difficult to win the nomination and criticized the \"lamestream media\" for focusing attention on her personal life.[294] In March 2011, Palin said, \"It's time that a woman is president of the United States of America.\"[295] On October 5, 2011, Palin said she had decided not to seek the Republican nomination for president.[296]\n2014 Alaska gubernatorial election endorsement\nIn October 2014, Palin endorsed the \"unity ticket\" of Independent Bill Walker and Democrat Byron Mallott in the 2014 Alaska gubernatorial election, which ran against her successor and former lieutenant governor, Sean Parnell.[297] The endorsement was prompted by Parnell's oil-and-gas industry tax-cuts, which dismantled her administration's \"Alaska's Clear and Equitable Share\" (ACES) plan. She had previously supported a referendum to repeal the tax cuts, which was narrowly defeated in August 2014.[298] Walker and Mallott made the repeal of the tax cuts a centerpiece of their campaign.[299] Walker and Mallott won the governorship in the November 2014 election with 48.1 percent of the vote, versus 45.9 percent for the Republican ticket.[300]\n2016 endorsements\nIn January 2016, Palin endorsed Donald Trump for president of the United States.[301]\nIn a May 2016 interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Palin said she would work to defeat Republican speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Palin cited Ryan's reluctance to support Trump for president.[302] In early August, Palin said again that she supported Paul Nehlen, a little-known Republican challenger to Ryan, despite Trump's support of Ryan.[303] A few days later, Ryan overwhelmingly defeated Nehlen in the Republican primary, taking over 84 percent of the vote.[304]\n2017 defamation lawsuit\nIn June 2017, Palin filed a defamation lawsuit against The New York Times for an editorial accusing Palin of \"political incitement\" in the run-up to the 2011 shooting of Democratic congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. The Times pointed out that a link to an advertisement from Palin's political action committee showed stylized crosshairs over the congressional districts held by 20 Democrats, including Giffords.[305][306] The Times later issued a correction, stating that no connection between the Palin advertisement and the Giffords shooting had been established and clarifying that what was depicted in the crosshairs in the ad were \"electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers.\" The Times wrote that the error did not \"undercut or weaken the argument of the piece\".[305] In subsequent testimony at an evidentiary hearing, Times editorial page editor James Bennet stated that the editorial sought to make a point about heated political rhetoric and was not intended to blame Palin for the attack on Giffords.[307]\nPalin's lawsuit was dismissed by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in August 2017. Judge Jed S. Rakoff ruled that Palin had failed to show actual malice on the part of the Times.[307] In August 2019, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reinstated Palin's suit, ruling that the district court erred when it held an evidentiary hearing on the newspaper's motion to dismiss rather than deciding the newspaper's motion to dismiss on the pleadings.[308] In August 2020, Rakoff denied both sides' motions for summary judgment and ordered a jury trial.[309][310] As the first libel case against the Times to go to trial in the U.S. in 18 years,[311] the suit was closely watched among First Amendment scholars.[311][312] On February 15, 2022, the jury reached a unanimous verdict in favor of The New York Times, finding that Palin had not proven actual malice.[313] Jurors were aware that the previous day Rakoff said he would dismiss the case regardless of their verdict after some jurors had received push notifications on their smart phones, though jurors said it did not affect their deliberations.[314] The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan revived the case in August 2024 citing mistakes by the judge, particularly his announcement during jury deliberations that he would dismiss the case.[315] On April 22, 2025, a federal jury found the Times was not liable for defamation against Palin.[316]\n2022 House of Representatives candidacy\nIn August 2021, Palin had hinted at a possible Senate bid, challenging incumbent centrist Republican Lisa Murkowski.[317][318] After the death of Alaska's at-large congressman Don Young, Palin instead ran in the 2022 special election for the vacated congressional seat.[319] On April 3, 2022, former president Donald Trump endorsed her run for the House of Representatives.[320]\nPalin was one of the three remaining of 50 initial candidates in the 2022 Alaska's at-large congressional district special election.[321] Al Gross, an independent, had dropped out of the \"top four\" runoff, leaving two Republicans remaining, Palin and Nick Begich III, along with Democratic ex-state House member, Alaska Native Mary Peltola.[322]\nPalin lost the special ranked choice election to Peltola following counting on August 31. She received 58,328 votes (30.9%) in the first round, and 85,987 votes (48.5%) once Begich's second preferences had been transferred.[323]\nAfter she lost the race to fill the remainder of Young's term, Palin urged Begich to drop out of the November election for the two-year term, but he refused to do so.[324] She later lost the general election in November by an even larger margin, receiving 25.7% of the vote in the first round to Peltola's 48.8%, then 45% in the second round, to Peltola's 55%.[325]\nPolitical positions\n| Part of a series on |\n| Conservatism in the United States |\n|---|\nPalin has been a registered Republican since 1982.[326]\nHealth care\nPalin opposed the 2010 health care reform package, saying it would lead to rationing of health care by a bureaucracy, which she described using the term \"death panels\". This legislation is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.[327] She opposes abortion, including in cases of rape and incest, though she supports it if the mother's life is in jeopardy. She also opposes embryonic stem cell research.[328] She supports parental consent as a requirement for female minors seeking an abortion.[329]\nSocial issues\nPalin opposes same-sex marriage[330] and supports capital punishment.[331] She has also called marijuana use a \"minimal issue\" and suggested that arresting cannabis users should be a low priority for local police. Although she opposes full legalization, she admits to smoking marijuana recreationally when it was legal in Alaska.[332]\nEducation\nPalin supports sex education in public schools that encourages sexual abstinence along with teaching about contraception.[333] She also supports discussion of creationism during lessons on evolution in public schools.[334] Palin believes evolution \"should be taught as an accepted principle\" and said that her belief in God's role in Earth's creation \"is not part of the state policy or a local curriculum in a school district. Science should be taught in science class.\"[335] (See Creation–evolution controversy.)\nGuns\nA Life Member of the National Rifle Association of America (NRA),[336] Palin interprets the Second Amendment as including the right to handgun possession and opposes bans on semi-automatic firearms.[337] She supports gun safety education for youth.[338]\nEnvironment\nPalin supports off-shore drilling, and land-based drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[92][339] When commenting on the Gulf Coast oil disaster Palin said, \"I repeat the slogan 'drill here, drill now.'\"[340] She said, \"I want our country to be able to trust the oil industry.\"[341] Palin asked supporters to read an article by Thomas Sowell that criticized Obama for having BP pay to an escrow fund.[342]\nPalin considers herself a conservationist[343] and during the 2008 campaign said \"of global warming, climate change, whether it's entirely, wholly caused by man's activities or is part of the cyclical nature of our planet...John McCain and I agree that we have to make sure that we're doing all we can to cut down on pollution.\"[344] She opposed cap-and-trade proposals contained in the yet to be defeated ACES energy bill.[345] Speaking at a 2009 Department of Interior hearing, Palin acknowledged that \"many believe\" a global effort to reduce greenhouse gases is needed. She stated, \"[S]topping domestic energy production of preferred fuels does not solve the issues associated with global warming and threatened or endangered species, but it can make them worse... These available fuels are required to supply the nation's energy needs during the transition to green energy alternatives.\"[346] After the election and the Climatic Research Unit email controversy, Palin spoke at a 2010 California logging conference calling studies supporting the scientific consensus on climate change \"snake oil science\". She attacked what she called \"heavy-handed\" environmental laws and cited her 2008 suit, as Alaska's governor, against the federal government to overturn the listing of polar bears as a threatened species. She considered environmental regulations as an economic burden to businesses trying to recover from the recession and environmental activists as wanting to \"lock up the land\".[343]\nForeign policy\nPalin is a strong supporter of Israel.[347][348] Referring to Iran's threat to Israel, Palin said Obama would be reelected if \"he played the war card. Say he decided to declare war on Iran or decided really come out and do whatever he could to support Israel, which I would like him to do.\"[349]\nOn foreign policy, Palin supported the George W. Bush administration's policies in Iraq, but was concerned that \"dependence on foreign energy\" may be obstructing efforts to \"have an exit plan in place\".[350][351] Palin supports preemptive military action in the face of an imminent threat, and supports U.S. military operations in Pakistan. She also supported the surge strategy in Iraq, the use of additional ground forces in Afghanistan, and, in general, maintaining a strong defensive posture by increasing the defense budget.[352]\nPalin opposed the Obama administration's proposed 2013 military intervention in Syrian Civil War, suggesting to let \"Allah sort it out\" in the Syrian Civil War.[353]\nIn 2008, Palin supported NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia,[354] and affirms that if Russia invaded a NATO member, the United States should meet its treaty obligations.[355] During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Palin advocated for a reduction in U.S. military aid to Ukraine and criticized U.S. involvement in the conflict.[356]\nPalin opposed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action which placed limits on Iran's nuclear program, on the grounds that the treaty was not strict enough. In a September 9, 2015, speech, she said, \"Only in an Orwellian Obama world full of sparkly fairy dust blown from atop his unicorn as he's peeking through a pretty pink kaleidoscope would he ever see victory or safety for America or Israel in this treaty.\"[357]\nTelevision appearances\nIn 2016, Palin appeared as a guest panel on the Season 1 Finale of the ABC-rebooted Match Game[358]\nIn 2020, Palin competed in season three of The Masked Singer as \"Bear\". She was the first of Group C to be eliminated and stated to Nick Cannon that she did it as a 'walking middle finger to the haters'.[359]\nPersonal life\nIn August 1988, Palin eloped with Todd Palin, her high-school sweetheart,[44] and together they have five children: sons Track Charles James (born 1989)[360][361] and Trig Paxson Van (born 2008), and daughters Bristol Sheeran Marie[362] (born 1990), Willow Bianca Faye (born 1994), and Piper Indy Grace (born 2001).[363][364] Palin's youngest child, Trig, born 2008, was prenatally diagnosed with Down syndrome.[365]\nTodd Palin worked for oil company BP as an oil-field production operator, retiring in 2009. He owns a commercial fishing business.[43][366]\nPalin was \"baptized Catholic as a newborn\" as her mother, Sally, had been raised Catholic. However, the Heath family \"started going to non-denominational churches\" thereafter.[367] Later, her family joined the Wasilla Assembly of God, a Pentecostal church,[368] which she attended until 2002.[369] Palin then switched to the Wasilla Bible Church.[370] Several news reports posted immediately after McCain named her his running mate called her the first Pentecostal/charismatic believer to appear on a major-party ticket.[371] However, Palin herself eschews the \"Pentecostal\" or \"charismatic\" label, describing herself as a \"Bible-believing Christian\".[367]\nTodd filed for divorce from Sarah on August 29, 2019, citing \"incompatibility of temperament\". He requested an equal division of debts and assets, and to have joint custody of their son, Trig.[372] The divorce was finalized on March 23, 2020.[373][374]\nPublic image\nIn June 2008, the Alumni Association of North Idaho College gave Palin its Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award.[31][375]\nPrior to the 2008 Republican National Convention, a Gallup poll found that a majority of voters were unfamiliar with Sarah Palin. During her campaign to become vice president, 39% said Palin was ready to serve as president if needed, 33% said Palin was not, and 29% had no opinion. This was \"the lowest vote of confidence in a running mate since the elder George Bush chose then-Indiana senator Dan Quayle to join his ticket in 1988.\"[376] Following the convention, her image came under close media scrutiny,[377][378] particularly with regard to her religious perspective on public life, her socially conservative views, and her perceived lack of experience or intelligence. Palin's lack of experience in foreign and domestic politics was criticized by conservatives as well as liberals following her nomination.[379][380][381][382] At the same time, Palin became more popular than John McCain among Republicans.[383]\nOne month after being introduced as McCain's running mate, she was viewed both more favorably and unfavorably among voters than her Democratic opponent, Delaware Senator Joe Biden.[384] A plurality of the television audience rated Biden's performance higher at the 2008 vice-presidential debate.[384][385]\nMedia outlets repeated Palin's statement that she \"stood up to Big Oil\" when she resigned after 11 months as the head of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. She said it was because of abuses she witnessed involving other Republican commissioners and their ties to energy companies and energy lobbyists; she claimed to have confronted the industry when she raised taxes on oil companies as governor.[386][387] In turn, others have said that Palin is a \"friend of Big Oil\" due to her advocacy for oil exploration and development including for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and for the de-listing of the polar bear as an endangered species.[386][387]\nSince 2017, Palin has spoken out in support of Julian Assange and in 2020 she called for him to be pardoned, saying, \"I am the first one to admit when I make a mistake and I admit that I made a mistake some years ago, not supporting Julian Assange, thinking that he was a bad guy”.[388]\nPalin was named one of America's \"10 Most Fascinating People of 2008\" by Barbara Walters for an ABC special on December 4, 2008.[389] In April 2010, she was selected as one of the world's 100 most influential people by Time magazine.[390]\nElectoral history\n| Party | Candidate | Votes | % | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Nonpartisan | Sarah Palin | 530 | 54.92 | |\n| Nonpartisan | John Hartrick | 310 | 32.12 | |\n| Write-in | Others | 125 | 12.95 | |\n| Total votes | 965 |\n| Party | Candidate | Votes | % | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Nonpartisan | Sarah H.

In the 2013 survey, 84 percent of gun owners and 90 percent of non-owners supported background checks for all gun sales. Support for banning assault weapons among all respondents decreased from 69 percent in 2013 to 63 percent in 2015, and support for banning the sale of large capacity ammunition magazines decreased from 68 percent to 60 percent. Notably, the small erosion in support for these policies occurred almost entirely among non-gun-owners.\nThe 2015 national survey was conducted two years from the date the 2013 survey was fielded, and used the same sampling approach and survey research firm, GfK. The latest survey included 1,326 respondents, while 2013 survey included 2,703 participants.\nMore than 11,000 people in the United States are killed each year as a result of gun homicides, and the firearm homicide rate in the U.S. is seven times higher than in the average high-income country.\n“The extraordinarily high rate of gun violence in the U.S. is due in large part to weaknesses in our standards for legal gun ownership and laws to hold individuals accountable if they put guns into the wrong hands,” says study author Daniel Webster, ScD, MPH, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. “Yet when we poll Americans, we see strong support even among gun owners for stricter standards and increased accountability.”\nIn the 2015 survey, the majority of gun owners surveyed support prohibiting a person convicted of a serious crime as a juvenile from having a gun for 10 years (73 percent), prohibiting people who have been convicted of public display of gun in a threatening manner excluding self-defense from having a gun for 10 years (75 percent), and prohibiting people convicted of domestic violence from having a gun for 10 years (76 percent).\nSimilarly, the majority of gun owners (67 percent) also support allowing cities to sue licensed gun dealers when the gun dealer's sales practices allow criminals to obtain guns and requiring a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison for a person convicted of knowingly selling a gun to someone who cannot legally have one (71 percent).\n“All too often, pollsters ask Americans whether they support more or less gun control, or frame gun policies as controls on gun ownership generally rather than as measures to keep guns from criminals or other high-risk groups,” Barry says. “When you drill down to specific policies, you see that Americans are very much in support of common-sense regulations to keep their families and communities safe from gun violence.”\n“Two years after Newtown—public opinion on gun policy revisited” was written by Colleen Barry, PhD, MPP, Emma Beth McGinty, PhD, MS, Jon Vernick, JD, MPH and Daniel Webster, ScD, MPH.\nThe research was supported by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg Philanthropies.

The poll, first reported by the Washington Post, was conducted by Global Strategy Group and surveyed thousands of 2020 voters nationwide in the weeks after November’s election. Key data from the poll shows that 93% of Americans support background checks on all gun sales (on par with job creation and passing another COVID-19 relief package), 86% of 2020 ticket splitters agree that “there is no excuse for the next president and Congress not to pass background checks into law on day one,” and two thirds of ticket splitters want to see the president take executive action on gun safety.\nThis polling underlines the need for urgent action after a deadly year of gun violence exacerbated by an ongoing pandemic, in which skyrocketing gun sales strained our background check system and the country saw increases in city gun violence, homicides, increased risk of domestic violence, and more.\n“This poll — and this election — send a clear message that gun safety has gone from the third rail of American politics to one of the first things on voters’ minds,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety. “Gun safety is good policy and good politics, and acting on it now could unify the country in a way few other issues could.”\n“Americans are watching and waiting, fed up with decades of excuses, denials, and failures as the number of families hurt by gun violence climbs higher every year,” said Peter Ambler, Giffords Executive Director. “Leaders in Washington are ready to turn the page and take action to address the gun violence in our country that has unfortunately become a fact of life. And if they do, voters will be ready to stand with elected officials who reject the radicalization of the Second Amendment and work to sign universal background checks into law.”\nThe polling demonstrates that gun safety is a unifying and urgent issue for Democrats, Republicans, and gun owners alike.\nToplines include:\n- Voters overwhelmingly support background checks on all gun sales: 93% of Americans support background checks on all gun sales, on par with job creation and passing another COVID-19 relief package;\n- Americans want immediate action on gun safety: 86% of ticket splitters agree that “there is no excuse for the next president and Congress not to pass background checks into law on day one,” and 78% of ticket splitters believe that requiring background checks on all gun sales should be a major priority to address in the first 100 days.\n- Support remains strong in the face of opposition messaging: Majorities of Democrats (86%), independents (74%), Republicans (64%), gun owners (67%), and ticket splitters (59%) all strongly support requiring background checks on all gun sales –– and trying to attack a Democrat for supporting background checks does not improve the effectiveness of the standard Republican attack lines that Democrats are likely to face..\n- Executive actions on gun safety enjoy broad support: Two-thirds of ticket splitters want to see the president take executive action on gun safety. Particular executive actions enjoy even more support, specifically, 85% of voters support prohibiting untraceable ghost guns.\n- Americans will hold politicians accountable for standing in the way of gun safety: 70% of ticket splitters and voters nationwide say they would never vote for a candidate who opposes background checks.\nThe full polling memo can be found here.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Majority of Americans, Including Gun Owners, Support a Variety of Gun Policies\nSurvey finds strong support among gun owners and non-gun owners for more than twenty gun violence prevention policies-including extreme risk protection orders\nA new national public opinion survey conducted by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health finds widespread agreement among gun owners, non-gun owners, and across political party affiliations for many U.S. gun violence prevention policies.\nThe survey, fielded in January 2019, measured support for over two dozen gun-related policies and found high levels of support for most measures, including purchaser licensing (77 percent), universal background checks of handgun purchasers (88 percent), and two key elements of extreme risk protection policies, also known as “red flag” laws:\n- Authorizing law enforcement officers to temporarily remove guns from individuals determined to pose an immediate threat of harm to self or others was supported by 76 percent of adults overall, and by majorities of gun owners (66 percent) and non-gun owners (80 percent)\n- Allowing family members to ask a court to temporarily remove guns from a relative believed to be at risk of harming self or others was supported by 80 percent of adults overall, and by majorities of gun owners (72 percent) and non-gun owners (82 percent)\nThe study, published online September 9 in the journal Health Affairs, is part of Health Affairs’ October issue focused on violence.\nJohns Hopkins researchers have tracked Americans’ support through the Johns Hopkins National Survey of Gun Policy every two years during the month of January dating back to 2013. The 2019 survey includes 1,680 respondents including 610 gun owners and 1,070 non-gun owners. The breakdown by political party affiliation of survey respondents was 499 Republicans, 531 Democrats and 650 Independents. Findings from the 2019 survey are consistent with prior survey waves conducted in 2017, 2015, and 2013, and trends over time suggest growing national support for a number of policies to reduce the toll of gun violence in the U.S. Between 2015 and 2019, public support increased significantly for policies requiring purchaser licensing, safe gun storage, universal background checks, and extreme risk protection orders.\nThe Labor Day weekend mass shooting in west Texas that killed at least seven people and injured 22 follows on the heels of the August back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, that killed 31 people and injured dozens more have heightened national interest in policies to address gun violence. Gun policy is already a focus in the 2020 election cycle.\n“Our study offers strong evidence that there are many policies with broad support among the American public that lawmakers can consider to reduce gun violence,” says lead author Colleen Barry, PhD, MPP, Fred and Julie Soper Professor and Chair of the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “In the face of highly contentious political debate, this study points to important areas where there is broad agreement among the public.” Barry is also a core faculty member at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, based at the Bloomberg School.\nThe 2019 National Survey of Gun Policy survey examined for the first time public support for a range of concealed-carry policies. High levels of public support were found for requiring safety training when applying for a concealed carry license overall (81 percent), among both gun owners (73 percent) and non-gun owners (83 percent). There were greater differences between views of gun owners and non-gun owners on concealed-carry restrictions unrelated to safety training:\n- 36 percent of the public supported allowing concealed carry on college or university campuses, with higher support among gun owners (55 percent) than non-gun owners (29 percent).\n- 31 percent of the public supported allowing those who are licensed to carry concealed guns on school grounds from kindergarten through 12th grade, with higher support among gun owners (47 percent) than non-gun owners (25 percent).\n- 22 percent of the public supported allowing concealed carry of a handgun in public without a license, with higher support among gun owners (34 percent) than non-gun owners (18 percent).\nThe survey also examined for the first time support for a number of other gun policies including prohibiting a person from making or carrying a gun without a serial number, such as a 3D-printed gun (75 percent support), and requiring the owner of semi-automatic rifle to be at least 21 (73 percent support).\nThe researchers combined survey data collected in 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019 to examine geographic variation by state in support of certain gun policies including universal background checks, assault weapon bans, purchaser licensing, and safe gun storage laws. Universal background checks were supported by three-quarters or more of respondents in all states examined (the 39 states with large enough state-level sample sizes). Majorities in 38 of 39 states supported requiring a person to obtain a license from a local law enforcement agency, and over 75 percent of those surveyed supported purchaser licensing in 23 of these states. More geographic variation in public support at the state level was found for licensing policies, safe storage policies, and assault weapon bans.\nAuthors used the NORC AmeriSpeak national online panel to field the 2019 and 2017 surveys, and the GfK Knowledge Networks national online panel to field the 2015 and 2013 surveys.\nFunding for the 2019 National Survey of Gun Policy data collection came from the Smart Family Foundation. Funding for earlier National Survey of Gun Policy surveys came from internal Johns Hopkins University sources, the Smart Family Foundation, and a gift from Bloomberg Philanthropies to the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research.

We honor the communities native to this continent, and recognize that our country was built on Indigenous homelands. We pay our respects to the millions of Indigenous people throughout history who have protected our lands, waters, and animals.\nWhile we meet in Chicago, we also recognize and honor the traditional homelands of the Anishinaabe, also known as the Council of the Three Fires: the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi Nations.\nWe acknowledge the many other tribes who consider this area their traditional homeland, including the Myaamia, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Sac and Fox, Peoria, Kaskaskia, Wea, Kickapoo, and Mascouten.\nDemocrats continue to support tribes as they advocate for the United States to uphold treaty and trust responsibilities. We applaud that in 2024, under the Biden-Harris Administration, the Prairie Band of Potawatomi Nation became the first federally recognized Tribal Nation in Illinois in 175 years, when the U.S. Department of the Interior placed 130 acres of the Shab-eh-nay reservation in nearby DeKalb County into trust.\nPreamble\nOur nation is at an inflection point. What kind of America will we be? A land of more freedom, or less freedom? More rights or fewer? An economy rigged for the rich and powerful, or where everyone has a fair shot at getting ahead? Will we lower the temperature in our politics and come together, or treat each other as enemies instead?\nThe stakes in this election are enormously high.\nPresident Biden and Vice President Harris took office during a time of global pandemic, record job loss, and record crime. These past four years, Democrats proved once again that democracy can deliver, and made tremendous progress turning the country around. President Biden and Vice President Harris turned a setback into a great American comeback for working families.\nWe've created nearly 16 million jobs, a record number of small businesses are being started, and factories are coming home. We lowered families' health insurance premiums, and we stood up to Big Pharma to lower prescription drug prices. We're helping students catch up on learning loss, and we're forgiving millions of crushing student loans. We passed the first significant gun safety law in decades and made record investments in public safety, putting more police officers on the beat; today, violent crime is at its lowest in 50 years. We're fighting climate change, reducing pollution, and fueling a clean energy boom. We're rebuilding our nation's roads, bridges, highways, ports, airports, water systems, and more. We're seizing record amounts of fentanyl and securing our border in the face of Republican inaction. We're closing the racial wealth gap and the gender pay gap. We've expanded benefits and services for toxic-exposed veterans; and we're strengthening NATO and restoring American leadership in the world.\nThere is so much more to do. Democrats will fix the tax system so everyone has a fair shot. We will restore the right to choose. We will continue to bring down costs for families. We will continue to reject political violence of all forms and give hate no safe harbor.\nDonald Trump has a very different vision – one focused not on opportunity and optimism, but on revenge and retribution; not on the American people, but on himself. He and his extreme MAGA allies are ripping away our bedrock personal freedoms, dictating what health care decisions women can make, banning books, and telling people who they can love. They're rigging our economy for their rich friends and big corporations, pushing more trickle-down tax cuts for the wealthy and powerful, and a new national sales tax that will cost every working family an average $2,500 a year. They'll cut the Social Security benefits that folks have paid into for their whole lives; and gut Medicare, Medicaid, health care, and prescription drug coverage. They are eroding our democracy with lies and threats, have refused to denounce political violence, and are making it harder to vote. And given the chance, they'll keep stacking our courts, locking in their extreme agenda for decades. We cannot let that happen.\nPresident Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats are running to finish the job. To grow our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. To reward work, not wealth. To lower costs. To tackle the climate crisis, lower energy costs, and secure energy independence. To protect communities and tackle the scourge of gun violence. To secure the border and fix the broken immigration system. To advance the President's Unity Agenda. To strengthen American leadership worldwide.\nHistory has shown that nothing about democracy is guaranteed. Every generation has to protect it, preserve it, choose it. We must stand together to choose what we want America to be.\nTable of Contents\nChapter One: Growing Our Economy from the Bottom Up & Middle Out 8\nEconomic Progress 8\nInvesting In America 9\nGood Jobs 10\nSmall Businesses 12\nAgriculture 13\nFighting Poverty 14\nEnding Special Interest Giveaways 15\nChapter Two: Rewarding Work, Not Wealth 16\nCutting Taxes For Working Families 17\nMaking The Wealthy & Big Corporations Pay Their Fair Share 17\nChapter Three: Lowering Costs 19\nHealth Care & Prescription Drugs 19\nChild Care, Home Care, & Paid Leave 22\nGas & Groceries 24\nCorporate Greed 24\nHousing 25\nEducation 28\nSocial Security, Pensions, & Medicare 30\nChapter Four: Tackling the Climate Crisis, Lowering Energy Costs, & Securing Energy Independence 32\nProducing Cleaner, More Affordable Energy 33\nLowering Energy Costs 33\nCreating Clean Energy Jobs 34\nReducing Pollution & Making Polluters Pay 35\nEnvironmental Justice 36\nBuilding Climate Resilient Communities 38\nConservation 38\nGlobal Climate Leadership 39\nChapter Five: Protecting Communities & Tackling the Scourge of Gun Violence 41\nGun Safety 41\nPolicing & Public Safety 42\nCriminal Justice 43\nViolence Against Women 45\nChapter Six: Strengthening Democracy, Protecting Freedoms, & Advancing Equity 47\nJudges 48\nVoting Rights 49\nStopping The Influence Of Special Interests 50\nReproductive Freedom 50\nWomen's Rights 52\nRacial Equity 54\nLgbtqi+ 58\nDisability 60\nTribal Nations 61\nCombating Hate & Protecting Freedom Of Religion 62\nFreedom Of The Press 64\nArts & Humanities 64\nD.C., Puerto Rico, Territories 65\nChapter Seven: Securing our Border & Fixing the Broken Immigration System 67\nSecuring The Border 68\nExpanding Legal Immigration & Deterring Illegal Immigration 70\nChapter Eight: Advancing the President's Unity Agenda 73\nBeating The Opioid Epidemic 73\nInvesting In Mental Health 74\nProtecting Kids Online, Strengthening Americans'\nData Privacy, & Promoting Competition 74\nEnding Cancer As We Know It 76\nMeeting Our Nation's Sacred Obligation To\nVeterans And Military Families 77\nChapter Nine: Strengthening American Leadership Worldwide 79\nEurope 79\nIndo-Pacific 81\nChina 82\nThe Middle East & North Africa 84\nWestern Hemisphere 87\nAfrica 88\nStrengthening The U.S. And Global Economy 89\nLeading With Diplomacy And American Values 90\nStrongest Military In The World 92\nChapter One: Growing Our Economy from the Bottom Up & Middle Out\nThis election is a choice between two very different economic visions for America: Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club at Mar-a-Lago; and Joe Biden, who sees it from kitchen tables in Scranton like the one he grew up around. His economic agenda is about Main Street, not Wall Street. It's about ending the days of trickle-down economics and investing in America – in all Americans – and delivering for communities too long left behind.\nWhile Democrats keep fighting to lower costs for working families, Trump is rigging our economy for his Mar-a-Lago friends and billionaire donors, who like him, are only in it for themselves.\nAs president, Trump doubled down on the trickle-down policies of the past, cutting investment in infrastructure and education, and rewarding big corporations that ship jobs and profits overseas. He vowed to bring new factories to communities across America, but left nothing behind but a string of broken promises.\nDemocrats have a different record. We're delivering on President Biden's pledge to rebuild our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. We're investing in America – in our infrastructure, our industry, our people, and our future. While Trump left office with historic budget deficits and the worst jobs record since Herbert Hoover, since President Biden took office, this country has come back from the brink, the deficit has fallen by over $1 trillion, and we have the best jobs record since John F. Kennedy. We're powering the strongest economic recovery in the world.\nECONOMIC PROGRESS\nAt the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, in the midst of the worst economic crisis in 100 years, experts feared a stagnating recovery and even worried about a new recession. But Democrats chose to put workers first, and instead of recession, America has seen remarkable strength and resilience. Our economy grew by 3.1 percent last year – the fastest rate of any major economy in the world.\nWe've added nearly 16 million jobs – not only recovering all the positions lost during Trump's botched handling of COVID, but also adding 6.3 million more than existed before the pandemic – surpassing pre-pandemic projections for the labor market. During this Administration, 30 states from Mississippi to Pennsylvania have seen record-low unemployment; and the run of low unemployment nationwide hasn't been this long in over 50 years. Wages are up across the board, and rising fastest for lower-income workers, Black workers, Latinos, and women. Today's recovery is the fairest on record; in just four years, we've erased 40 percent of the wage inequality gap that took four decades to build. A record 18 million small business applications have been filed since President Biden took office, each one of them an act of hope.\nWhile too many families still feel the pain of inflation at the grocery store, or around the kitchen table when they sit down to pay their bills, we're making progress. Wages are rising faster than prices, and inflation today is down nearly two-thirds from its peak. We have to finish the job. Democrats will keep fighting to prevent the kind of supply chain shocks and corporate greed that have done so much to raise prices. And we'll keep investing in American workers, American jobs, and American families, bringing factories home to win the race for the future. Democrats know the story of the middle class isn't separate from the state of the economy – it's at its heart. And we'll never quit fighting to make sure that everyone is in on the deal.\nINVESTING IN AMERICA\nInfrastructure\nWe can't have the best economy in the world if we don't have the best infrastructure. And for generations, American infrastructure was the envy of the world. But over the years, we stopped investing in it, and we fell to thirteenth in infrastructure rankings. The Trump Administration declared it \"Infrastructure Week\" every week for four years, and never built a thing. But under President Biden, we're finally rebuilding our roads, bridges, ports, airports, water systems, electric grids, broadband, and more, paving the way for a great American \"Infrastructure Decade\" that will create hundreds of thousands of good-paying union jobs.\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is breaking ground on over 57,000 projects across 4,500 communities nationwide. We're rebuilding major roadways, from the Blatnik Bridge, a vital link between Wisconsin and Minnesota that carries more $4 billion in goods a year through the largest Great Lakes port; to a key stretch of the I-10 outside Phoenix that sees 126,000 vehicles a day. We're making the biggest investment in public transit in history, and at last building America's first true high-speed rail lines. We're replacing every toxic lead pipe in the country within a decade, so every child can turn on the faucet at home or at school and drink clean water without risking cancer or brain damage. We've added over 80,000 megawatts of new clean power capacity, the equivalent of building 40 Hoover Dams, to help shrink energy costs and meet ambitious climate goals. And we're bringing affordable, reliable, high-speed internet to every American household. High-speed internet is as vital to our economy today as electricity first was a century ago; Americans need it to do their jobs, to do their homework, to access health care, and to stay connected. But a full 45 million of us still live in areas where there is no high-speed internet. Democrats are closing that divide. These projects don't just build infrastructure, they create hundreds of thousands of good jobs for American workers.\nManufacturing\nDemocrats are also taking historic steps to bring home critical supply chains, and to reaffirm our nation's leadership in cutting-edge industries that America in fact often pioneered. After the pandemic exposed our reliance on foreign-made semiconductors, we passed the CHIPS and Science Act, to restore America's role producing the tiny computer chips needed to make everything from cell phones to dishwashers to cars. And as the climate crisis makes the shift to clean energy more urgent, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act, making the world's biggest investment ever in building renewable energy, electric vehicles, and other green technologies here at home.\nThe President's Investing in America agenda has incentivized a historic $877 billion in private funding across the United States to date. Companies are investing hundreds of billions more than under Trump to build new factories. In fact, under President Biden, more than a dozen states have seen the largest private sector investments in their history. We've designated more than 30 tech hubs in communities from Reno, Nevada; to Charlotte, North Carolina; to North Central Pennsylvania. And we've made sure that lower-income counties see a larger share of investment. Today, instead of exporting American jobs for cheaper labor, we're creating American jobs and exporting products, leaving no one behind.\nUnder President Biden, we've also boosted funding for the kind of research and development that can seed economy-transforming breakthroughs, like the internet. In recent years, America became one of the world's only major countries to pull back on R&D investments; Democrats are changing that. President Biden for example launched the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) in 2022, to find game-changing medical cures and treatments and transform important areas of medicine. Under his leadership, we'll continue supporting NASA and America's presence on the International Space Station, and working to send Americans back to the moon and to Mars. Democrats will keep America at the forefront of scientific discovery and innovation, responsibly leading the way in the defining fields of the future, like AI, biotech, quantum computing, advanced materials, and more.\nGOOD JOBS\nThese generational investments are transforming our economy, creating new businesses, new jobs, and new cycles of hope – in red states and blue states; in rural, urban, and Tribal Nation communities too long left behind. In all, President Biden's agenda has already created nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs, and 880,000 more jobs in construction, building the roads, factories, and dreams of our future. More Americans are employed in these fields and clean energy today than ever were under Trump. President Biden's agenda requires that any federally-financed infrastructure job must include wage and labor protections. And we're making sure that these projects use American-made goods, by strengthening \"Buy American\" procurement rules to their toughest level in seven decades. That means every federally funded infrastructure project is being built with American-made steel, lumber, drywall, concrete, and other products, by American workers. And the Administration has taken historic steps to ensure that these workers are paid prevailing wages, with the free and fair choice to join a union; and to incentivize project labor agreements.\nPresident Biden believes that you shouldn't have to go to a four-year college to live a good, middle-class life. Democrats are working to make sure that every American can access these quality new jobs, where many people can earn over $100,000 a year. The American Rescue Plan supported more than 4,300 state- and local-government workforce development programs; while our Investing in American agenda is expanding job-training partnerships between high schools, community colleges, unions, and employers. We have a million trainees enrolled in registered apprenticeships today. Apprenticeships have long provided a reliable path to the middle class, empowering workers to earn while they learn, not only in traditional trades, but also in new cutting-edge industries. Extreme Republicans have proposed gutting funding for registered apprenticeships in this year's budget. We'll keep making historic investments in them to keep expanding opportunity, including by partnering directly with unions.\nDemocrats know that Wall Street didn't build America. The middle class built America – and unions built the middle class. President Biden and Vice President Harris are proud to lead the most pro-union Administration in history. President Biden named staunch labor allies and former union leaders to positions across the government, and empowered them to fight for good jobs and workers' rights. Biden is the first President to walk a picket line, joining UAW workers on strike in Detroit before they won historic wage increases last year. He knows that when unions win, all workers benefit; and as we rebuild our economy for the future, every worker needs a voice and a fair shot.\nDemocrats will keep fighting to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, to give everyone the right to organize for better pay, benefits, and working conditions, and to hold abusive bosses accountable for violating workers' rights. We oppose state right-to-work laws, which drive down wages and leave workers unsafe; and we support penalizing employers who engage in union busting. We'll work to pass the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, guaranteeing public sector bargaining rights; and to codify a right to organize for domestic workers, farm workers, and other unprotected laborers. Democrats will continue to create strong labor standards for jobs created with taxpayer dollars through legislation and with strong Buy American rules. Consistent with the law, we will ensure that federal grants and other assistance to employers are contingent on recipients committing to not interfering with workers' efforts to form a union. By leveraging the benefits of federal grants for infrastructure, manufacturing and services, we will seek to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to participate in the American Dream.\nWe'll strengthen enforcement and penalties for safety, wage, and other labor and employment violations. And, Democrats will continue to aggressively hold companies accountable for violating child labor law. We've increased funding for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to protect workers on the job; and we'll continue to support workplace whistleblowers.\nAt the same time, we're pushing to guarantee workers the pay, benefits, and protections they deserve as well. We passed the Butch Lewis Act, keeping over 2 million people's hard-earned pensions solvent. We also raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $17.20 an hour, and will keep pushing Congress to increase it to at least $15 for all Americans. We're making millions more hourly workers eligible for overtime pay; and we've cracked down on wage theft and exploitation, recovering over $750 million for low-wage workers wrongly denied pay. We're making it harder for employers to misclassify workers as independent contractors to avoid paying them full pay and benefits. We're banning most non-compete agreements, freeing workers to move between jobs and negotiate. And we've restricted mandatory arbitration, so fewer employers can silence wronged employees in a workplace dispute.\nWe also recognize that the U.S. Postal Service is the world's most efficient, and Democrats are wholly committed to supporting a public U.S.P.S. We will fight all efforts to privatize it and will work to ensure that it's financially sustainable. We will protect its universal service obligation and on-time delivery. And we will support a Board of Governors and a Postal Regulatory Commission that champion a strong public Postal Service.\nTrump has a very different record. As President, he not only failed to bring manufacturing jobs home, he pushed to cut funding for R&D and job training. He gave tax breaks to big corporations, with no condition that they invest in workers or innovation in return. He stacked his Labor Department and National Labor Relations Board with corporate lawyers who made it harder to organize, not easier. His Administration ripped protections from federal workers, slashed workplace safety inspections, and blocked increases in overtime pay. Now, Trump and his allies are vowing to repeal key pieces of the Biden agenda – stalling historic progress; undermining American manufacturing; and costing hundreds of thousands of Americans the good paychecks and future prospects that they deserve.\nDemocrats won't let that happen. We fought hard to pass the most significant investments in America in generations. Now, we'll continue the important work of implementing them, to be sure that the benefits are shared in every corner of America and create good-paying jobs that folks can raise a family on, with the chance to join a union, and that rely on materials made here at home. We cannot go backwards. We have to own these industries and jobs of the future.\nSMALL BUSINESSES\nSmall businesses are the engine of America's economy and the glue of our communities. They employ nearly half of all private sector workers, and drive half of all economic activity. They embody the vision and grit that literally built this country.\nWhen President Biden took office, our economy was reeling and millions of small businesses were hanging by a thread. Business owners faced the prospect of losing not just their livelihoods, but their dreams, their life's savings, and their hopes of leaving something behind for their kids. So Democrats moved fast. Within weeks, we reformed the Paycheck Protection Program, getting game-changing help to thousands of America's smallest businesses, which had been shut out by Trump. Then, we passed the American Rescue Plan and helped 6 million small businesses pay their bills and workers and stay afloat. And thanks to that legislation, we provided additional support to 100,000 restaurants and 220,000 child care centers serving millions of kids, which working parents rely on. Not a single Republican voted for it.\nSince then, Democrats have passed other historic laws, to build infrastructure, semiconductors, clean energy, and the small-business supply chains that support those cutting-edge industries, here at home. The Administration is expanding access to capital, business opportunities, and training to help those small businesses; while working for a fairer tax code, to level the playing field for small entrepreneurs who have to compete against corporate giants. The Administration has invested a record $12 billion in Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs), to support small businesses and growth across low-income communities. The Small Business Administration is nearly halfway to its goal of providing $250 billion in financing to 500,000 small businesses by 2030. For example, to get mom-and-pop businesses the small loans, under $150,000, that are often hard to secure, the SBA has brought in additional non-traditional lenders that specialize in working with underserved small businesses. It's now on track to double these loans by year's end, compared to 2020. The Administration is also directing billions of dollars to community lenders and state-level small-business programs. Along with initiatives like Vice President Harris's Economic Opportunity Coalition, it is mobilizing hundreds of billions more in private investment. At the same time, the federal government this year set a record for small business contract spending, awarding them 28 percent of total procurement dollars, directly supporting a million jobs. It is on track to meet its goal of increasing federal contracts awarded to small disadvantaged businesses by 50 percent.\nAs a result, America is today in the midst of a historic small-business boom. A record 18 million new business applications have been filed since Joe Biden became president – the three strongest years of new business growth in history, and over 90 percent faster than pre-pandemic averages. Since the pandemic, the share of Black households owning a business has more than doubled, Latino business ownership is up 40 percent, and women own a record share of businesses. As President Biden often says, each new business formed is an act of hope.\nThanks to President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Minority Business Development Agency is now a permanent part of the Commerce Department, where it's training underserved entrepreneurs. The SBA's innovative Community Navigators program meanwhile helped 350,000 small businesses tap into resources that have helped them grow. In a second Biden term, we'll make that Navigator program permanent, and include new lenders, new markets, and fairer taxes.\nTrump still puts Wall Street before Main Street. As president, he slashed the tax rate for giant corporations, but left small businesses behind. His disastrous response to COVID funneled assistance to well-connected friends and companies, but left too many of our smallest businesses without essential help. More than 300,000 closed. He's now running on a plan to double-down on his tax scam to benefit big corporations and billionaires. His Congressional allies keep trying to slash SBA funding, and to repeal our investments in infrastructure and manufacturing – the same ones that are lowering costs for small businesses, boosting their revenue, and helping millions to thrive. Democrats won't let that happen.\nAGRICULTURE\nAmerican farmers are the backbone of our country. They feed America, and help feed the world. But over the years, trickle-down economics has hit rural America hard. Farming costs have gone up and incomes have gone down. Big Agriculture moved in, telling too many small farms that the surest path to success was to get big or get out. As a result, we lost over 400,000 farms in America in the last 40 years, and rural communities have paid a steep price. Too many young people have had to leave their hometowns to find good-paying work and a shot at their dreams.\nThe President believes that no one should have to leave the community where they grew up just to find opportunity. His Investing in America agenda is investing in all of America, including farms and rural areas. It's creating new sources of income for farmers and increasing competition among suppliers, to both lower the cost of farm inputs and to get small and mid-size farmers a larger share of profits. The Inflation Reduction Act is helping farmers and ranchers adopt climate-smart practices, which make the land more resilient and increase profitability, while connecting them to new markets and premiums for sustainably produced commodities. The Administration recognizes the critical role that our land stewards play in our food systems, economy, and environment, and is working hard to drive both public and private funds to reward these champions for nature for their hard work. The Administration has also supported independent meat and poultry processing, reducing producers' reliance on big companies to buy their product; and it's working to make livestock and poultry markets fairer and more transparent. Today, family farms have more income from more varied sources, so their children have more opportunity to stay family farmers.\nAt the same time, the Administration is helping family farmers service distressed loans in order to keep their lands and ultimately pass them down to their kids. It has worked with many farmers to boost the production of expensive fertilizer, increasing supply and easing costs for everyone else. The U.S.D.A. also expanded farm insurance to allow for more double cropping, a practice that increases farm earnings, expands the food supply, and helps lower average food prices for American families. Going forward, Democrats will also work to get farmers the right to repair their own equipment, without having to pay big equipment makers for diagnostic tools and repairs. And we will look to further limit foreign ownership of U.S. farmland to protect our food supply and national security.\nThroughout, Democrats have stood by farm workers. We are working to improve workers' safety at meat processing facilities, and we will continue to enforce and advance labor and environmental rules, for example promoting organizing rights and requiring overtime pay, and boosting protections against harmful pesticides and extreme heat.\nFIGHTING POVERTY\nAs Democrats, we believe in an America where people look out for one another and leave no one behind. But we know we still have a long way to go to make America's promise real for everyone. Some 40 million Americans still live in poverty. The pandemic made things worse, hitting the poor hardest, and pushing millions more families to the brink. The American Rescue Plan drove poverty to record lows in 2021. It expanded the Child Tax Credit and made it available to all low-income children for the first time, helping to slash child poverty by nearly half. It tripled the maximum Earned Income Tax Credit for millions of low-income workers, so their taxes wouldn't push them deeper into poverty. It kept 8 million families in their homes, child care centers open, and small businesses on their feet. It increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, helping tens of millions of Americans keep food on the table. Not a single Republican voted for the bill.\nAnd the Administration has done more. It reversed a Trump-era policy that would have risked putting half-a-million children in poverty. It modernized SNAP benefits for the first time since 1975, permanently increasing them and lifting more than 2 million people, including over a million children, out of poverty as well. President Biden signed into law a permanent special summer nutrition program that will help 21 million kids. And he successfully blocked Congressional Republican proposals that would've increased poverty by slashing health care, housing, food assistance, and more.\nNow, it's time to finish the job. Democrats know that most folks fundamentally want the same things – not a hand out, but a fair shot. That's why we'll keep pushing to restore the expanded Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, which proved so effective at reducing poverty before Republicans let them expire. We'll work to finally raise the federal minimum wage to at least $15-an-hour. We'll fight for paid leave, better health care, and more investment in public schools and affordable housing. We'll reduce the need for foster care, by supporting families and engaging kin. We'll further expand public transit, connecting communities that have been cut off for too long. We'll keep working to get more low-income families access to affordable banking as well, and to boost the supply of capital and loans by investing more in CDFIs. We'll also push to make the New Markets Tax Credit permanent, drawing new investment to low-income communities nationwide. And we'll continue to reject Republican proposals to increase poverty by making devastating cuts to programs that vulnerable Americans count on.\nIn the wealthiest nation on earth, we all benefit when we help one another. Democrats will keep working to build an economy that rewards work, not wealth; where we care for the most vulnerable, and unleash the potential that all our children have to grow and thrive. We remain committed to fighting poverty and enabling all Americans to live up to their God-given potential.\nENDING SPECIAL INTEREST GIVEAWAYS\nTo invest in the American people and reduce the deficit, Democrats are also ending giveaways to big corporations and special interests that have benefitted at the expense of American taxpayers for too long.\nWe're seizing a tremendous opportunity for savings on prescription drugs and insurance. The Administration has already cracked down on one of Big Pharma's biggest scams, by finally giving Medicare, the single biggest buyer of drugs in America, the ability to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, as the VA and private insurers have done for years. The Administration is also requiring drugmakers to reimburse Medicare if they hike prices faster than inflation. That kind of markup pads Big Pharma profits, wasting taxpayer dollars. Democrats will expand the number of drugs subject to price caps and negotiation under the Inflation Reduction Act, saving taxpayers nearly $160 billion over the next 10 years, as Medicare will no longer have to pay Big Pharma exorbitant prices.\nAt the same time, we'll keep pushing to crack down on outsize insurance company profits, for example by requiring health insurers to reimburse Medicaid if they bill more than they actually spend on patient care. We also believe in saving taxpayers money by investing more in preventative health care, vaccines, and other treatment for Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries, avoiding unnecessary medical costs by keeping folks healthy – investing in America, and in the American people.\nChapter Two: Rewarding Work, Not Wealth\nTo any American with the ingenuity and drive to make a million bucks, President Biden says, great. Just pay your fair share in taxes. A hedge fund manager or CEO should never pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or firefighter. A company with billions of dollars in profits should not pay $0 in taxes.\nA fair tax code is how we invest in the things that make our nation strong, like health care, education, a clean environment, and the national defense. It's how we protect programs that Americans rely on, like Social Security and Medicare. It's how we build a powerful economy, reduce fiscal risks, and lead the world.\nDonald Trump is focused on rigging the game for his billionaire donors instead. He always puts himself and his rich friends first. In 2017, he enacted a reckless, unpaid-for tax cut that overwhelmingly benefited the very wealthy and biggest corporations. It was full of outrageous giveaways, including a massive tax break for the wealthiest 0.1 percent. It slashed the corporate tax rate by nearly half, with executives plowing their windfalls into stock buybacks for their own benefit, rather than investing in workers or better products, or lowering prices. After weakening labor protections and complaining that wages are \"too high,\" Trump is now telling donors behind closed doors at Mar-a-Lago: \"You're rich as hell, and we're going to give you tax cuts.\"\nThat trickle-down approach never worked. Trump's allies predicted that his tax scam would push economic growth as high as 6 percent, but America's growth rate barely changed. The law had no impact on the average American's income – only boosting wages for those in the top 10 percent. Trump's allies claimed it would pay for itself, but it instead exploded the federal deficit by $2 trillion. Trump's policies added more to our national debt than has ever been added in a presidential term.\nCorporate profits have doubled since the pandemic, yet Trump wants to reward corporations with another big tax cut. Republicans are doubling down on Trump's failed approach and have proposed $1 trillion in new corporate tax cuts. They'll repeal the estate tax, so the wealthiest 0.1 percent of Americans can pass wealth on to their heirs tax-free. They'll give American billionaires an average $3.5 million tax break – a giveaway nearly 50 times bigger than what the average family earns in a year. House Republicans have vowed to pay for part of all that by cutting Social Security and Medicare for everyone else. Economists say Trump's billionaire giveaways and extreme tariffs will slow growth, cost jobs, and trigger a recession his first year back in office, raising taxes on middle-class families by $2,500 a year, and adding trillions to the deficit.\nDemocrats have a different view. We don't believe we should add $5 trillion to the national debt to give more tax breaks skewed to the wealthy and big corporations. We're fighting to reward work, not wealth – to cut costs and make the tax code fairer for the middle class, while making the wealthy and big corporations finally pay their fair share. Under President Biden's plan, no American earning less than $400,000 a year will pay one single penny more in federal taxes, period. We're working to end special interest giveaways, and to make sure all Americans play by the same rules. And instead of exploding the national deficit, our plan cuts it by $3 trillion over the next decade, delivering real results for the American people in a fiscally responsible way.\nCUTTING TAXES FOR WORKING FAMILIES\nDemocrats will protect everyone earning less than $400,000 a year from any tax increase; and we will fight to protect and expand other tax benefits for working people and families with children.\nDuring the pandemic, Democrats expanded the Child Tax Credit, saving nearly 40 million families with 65 million children up to $3,600 per child per year, and cutting child poverty nearly in half to its lowest rate on record. We expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit as well, saving over 17 million low-paid workers an average $700 a year. And, we expanded the health insurance premium tax credit, saving millions of families who buy coverage on an Affordable Care Act exchange about $800 a year.\nRepublicans are opposed to this tax relief for families that need it. They already blocked renewal of our Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit expansions, pushing 3 million children back into poverty. Republicans also keep trying to repeal our premium tax credit expansions, which will raise health care costs for millions of families. Democrats will keep fighting to restore and protect that tax relief, giving tens of millions of families some breathing room again. And President Biden has also proposed a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers and people selling their first homes, to help reduce housing costs for working families.\nThe Treasury Department and the IRS are also making it easier and cheaper for Americans to file their taxes and collect the refunds they're owed. The IRS successfully piloted a free, easy-to-use online tool, Direct File, which has already saved taxpayers millions of dollars in filing fees. It has since announced that Direct File will be a permanent offering, saving users an average $150 in filing costs – but Republicans keep trying to defund this free tool.\nMAKING THE WEALTHY & BIG CORPORATIONS PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE\nPresident Biden's plans will cut taxes for middle-class and low-income Americans – and we'll finance those cuts by making the ultra-wealthy and big corporations finally start paying their fair share.\nThere are a thousand billionaires in America, and they pay an average 8 percent in taxes – a far lower rate than a firefighter or teacher. Democrats will make billionaires pay a minimum income tax rate of 25 percent, raising $500 billion in 10 years. We'll end the preferential treatment for capital gains for millionaires, so they pay the same rate on investment income as on wages.\nWe'll put an end to abusive life insurance tax shelters, and stop billionaires from exploiting retirement tax incentives that are supposed to help middle-class families save. We'll eliminate the \"stepped-up basis\" loophole for the wealthiest Americans, so they can't avoid paying taxes on their wealth by passing it down to heirs. Democrats will close the \"carried interest\" loophole, which wealthy fund managers have long used to halve tax rates on their own personal pay, so they pay a lower rate than some teachers or firefighters do. That's wrong. And, we'll increase our new stock buyback tax to 4 percent to discourage stock buybacks that benefit executives and wealthy shareholders, instead of workers and consumers.\nWe will also keep upping the pressure on wealthy and corporate tax cheats that fail to pay what they owe. The IRS was severely underfunded for years; but Democrats are improving IRS services for everyday taxpayers and reviving enforcement against wealthy and corporate tax cheats, raising more than an estimated $440 billion in additional revenue as a result. The IRS has already collected over $500 million in unpaid taxes from less than 2,000 delinquent millionaires, and launched efforts aimed at thousands of other millionaires who hadn't filed a return in years. Democrats will protect this progress by continuing to invest in modernizing the IRS. Republicans are working to reverse it, protecting wealthy tax cheats and increasing the deficit instead.\nDemocrats will also make billion-dollar companies pay their fair share. In 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion in profit, but paid zero in federal income taxes.\nCorporations are seeing record margins, but their share of federal taxes has fallen below 10 percent, down from 30 percent in the 1950s. It's wrong. Trump doesn't care: he slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, down from 35 percent. President Biden will raise that rate back to 28 percent. And for those billion-dollar tax dodgers, the President signed a historic 15 percent corporate minimum tax into law. He also reached a global minimum tax agreement with 140 countries, so that big multinational companies will no longer be able to pit nations against one another in a race to the bottom. And, Biden will double the tax rate that American multinationals pay on foreign earnings to 21 percent; and end incentives, introduced by Trump, that encourage companies to shift jobs and operations overseas and book profits in low-tax countries.\nDemocrats oppose unfair loopholes and wasteful subsidies that benefit special interests at everyone else's expense. We will fight to get rid of them. That starts by eliminating tens of billions of dollars in subsidies for oil and gas companies. It means ending special tax breaks for corporate jets, and boosting fuel taxes on corporate and private jet travel, saving taxpayers $4 billion over 10 years. And we'll no longer permit companies to deduct the cost of paying executives more than $1 million a year. Corporations shouldn't get a tax break for giving huge pay packages to CEOs.\nWe'll also eliminate the so-called \"like-kind exchange\" loophole that allows wealthy real estate investors to avoid paying taxes on real estate profits, as long as they keep investing in real estate – a tax break that Trump protected for himself and other corporate landlords in his 2017 tax scam. No other industry has that kind of sweetheart deal; it ends now.\nChapter Three: Lowering Costs\nToday, our economy is growing, wages are rising, and a record number of Americans have good jobs. But for too many hard-working families, the cost of living is too high. Lowering costs is Democrats' number one economic priority. We're using every tool to bring prices down on health insurance and prescription drugs, including negotiating the price of commonly used drugs for diabetes and heart failure; and on housing, child care, internet, banking, credit cards, and more. We have more to do, but our actions are already putting thousands of dollars a year back in people's pockets. Those savings add up, and Democrats will keep fighting until every American feels them.\nWhen the pandemic disrupted supply chains, everyday items became hard to get, raising prices. When Russia invaded Ukraine, food and gas prices spiked more. As companies' costs went up, they raised prices, too. President Biden worked across industries to ease supply bottlenecks and get goods and energy flowing again. He delivered, and inflation has since dropped two-thirds from its peak.\nBut some companies haven't passed those new savings on to consumers. Their costs have come down, but they've kept prices high anyway, boosting profits. Corporate profits have more than doubled since 2017. Last year, after-tax profit ratios for corporations outside the financial sector were their highest in 90 years.\nPresident Biden's lowering costs agenda is historic in scope, attacking the issue from every angle to help cut costs for consumers, crack down on price gouging, and get companies to use their record profits to reduce prices long-term. It's also investing in making things in America again to boost supply, push down prices, and bring jobs home.\nDonald Trump hasn't offered a single solution to lower families' costs. He wants to drag America backwards, with extreme import tariffs that will make life more expensive for folks nationwide. And for corporations that hiked prices and doubled profits since the pandemic, Trump wants to reward them with a massive tax cut. Independent analysts say his MAGA tax and tariff plans will increase inflation, cost 3 million American jobs, and slow growth, triggering a recession in his first year back in office. Trump's plan will increase costs for working families by $2,500 a year.\nToday, America has built its way back into the strongest economic recovery in the world. Democrats won't let Trump throw that all away.\nHEALTH CARE & PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\nHealth Care\nHealth care should be a right in America, not a privilege. Every American deserves the peace of mind that quality, affordable coverage brings. That's why Democrats fought so hard to pass the Affordable Care Act, providing 45 million Americans with insurance, guaranteeing protections for 100 million people with preexisting conditions, and protecting nearly 180 million people from lifetime coverage limits. Yet even now, 14 years after we passed that landmark law, Trump and Republicans are still threatening to repeal it. Democrats will never let that happen. We'll never quit fighting to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act, making quality care more accessible and affordable, as the Biden-Harris Administration has done.\nToday, more Americans have health insurance than ever in history. Coverage is up and costs are down. A record 21 million people signed up through the Affordable Care Act this year, helping to slash the uninsured rate from 16 percent in 2010 to under 8 percent now. Democrats have expanded the health insurance premium tax credit twice, saving millions of Americans an average of $800 a year on coverage; and helping an additional 1.7 million Latinos, 830,000 Black Americans, and 110,000 Asian Americans buy more affordable insurance. Republicans want to let those credits expire, increasing premiums. Democrats will fight to make them permanent.\nAs Democrats, we support Medicaid expansion, encouraging states to provide health coverage to low-income Americans on the federal government's tab. The Administration has helped over a million people in four states to enroll; and we'll keep pushing Congress to further expand Medicaid-like coverage to the 2.8 million uninsured low-income adults who live in states where Republicans still refuse the help.\nDemocrats are working to protect kids' health coverage as well, by removing financial barriers for the Children's Health Insurance Program; and making it easier for families to keep kids on Medicaid. President Biden's plan will let families go three years without having to resubmit Medicaid paperwork for children younger than six, reducing burdensome red tape.\nDemocrats believe that quality, affordable health care should be available in every corner of America. The Administration has invested in new mobile health clinics; and in keeping community and rural health centers, lifelines for tens of millions of people, open, well-staffed, and well-equipped. We want to double those investments now. And the Administration is cracking down on federally funded health care providers that turn away or otherwise discriminate against people on the basis of race, sex, age, national origin, or disability.\nDemocrats will keep working to grow the health care workforce, so workplace and other provider shortages no longer create barriers to quality care and inflate health care costs. We are investing in programs that train primary care practitioners, registered nurses, mental health specialists, and others to work across our health care system, including in rural and low-income areas.\nThe Administration is also cracking down on surprise medical billing and junk health insurance, so patients are no longer ambushed by unexpected bills or scammed into buying low-quality health coverage. Democrats will expand \"no-surprise billing\" to include costly ground ambulances; and we'll keep using antitrust laws to stop hospital, insurance, and Big Pharma mergers that undermine competition and increase health care prices for consumers.\nAt the same time, Democrats will keep fighting to ease the burden of medical debt, which makes it harder for millions of Americans to get a mortgage or other loan for the future. Democrats provided funding to forgive $7 billion in medical debt for nearly 3 million Americans; and the Administration is urging states to use remaining funds to do more. It already persuaded credit reporting agencies to exclude many medical debts from credit reports, boosting people's credit scores and prospects for the future. In all, these actions have reduced the total number of Americans with listed medical debt from 46 million in 2020 to 15 million. Democrats will keep pushing to exclude medical debts from credit scoring entirely.\nDemocrats also support the Administration's historic work to close fundamental gaps in women's health care, including by protecting access to reproductive health care. This includes its efforts to reduce maternal mortality, led by Vice President Harris. She called for states to provide a full year of postpartum coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries, with 46 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands now taking that step. The Administration is also making transformative investments in women's health research to find better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat health conditions in women, and to make care more accessible and affordable. And it is leading game-changing work to end cancer as we know it, including through the creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H).\nTrump has no plan to reduce health care costs for Americans. He and his MAGA allies have spent years working to repeal the Affordable Care Act, trying and failing over 50 times. Now, Trump is once again promising to \"terminate\" the landmark law, gutting coverage for the 45 million Americans who rely on it for care. Doing so will cost families $13,000 a year, and threaten protections for 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. It will strip 150 million people of preventative care like cancer screenings, and reduce access to mental health and substance use treatment. A Republican repeal will also deny life-changing home care to millions of seniors and people with disabilities, and kick young adults up to age 26 off their parents' insurance plans. And, it'll push more of the 500-plus rural hospitals that are already at risk of closing to shut down.\nPrescription Drugs\nBig Pharma has ripped off Americans for years, charging two and three times more here than in other countries for the exact same medications. Nearly three in ten Americans can't afford their prescriptions as a result. Instead of working to change that, Trump gave drugmakers massive tax breaks that only incentivized them to shift production overseas.\nPresident Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats took on Big Pharma and won. Democrats capped the price of insulin at $35 a month, down from as much as $400, for nearly 4 million seniors on Medicare. And President Biden persuaded the nation's top three insulin makers to lower their prices for everyone. Now, we'll fight to expand that $35 cap to cover everyone, saving millions of Americans with diabetes nearly $1,000 a year. Starting next year, the Inflation Reduction Act also caps total out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000 a year for millions of seniors and others on Medicare. Democrats will fight until that cap covers every single American.\nFor the first time, Medicare now also has the ability to negotiate lower drug prices, as private insurers and the VA have done for decades. It started doing so this year, beginning with 10 commonly used medications for conditions such as diabetes and heart failure. Democrats will push to add at least 50 drugs a year to that list, lowering prices for 500 drugs this decade. Medicare Part-D is also working to cap cost-sharing for life-saving generics at $2 a dose; Democrats will make this mandatory for all Medicare beneficiaries.\nThe Administration is also leading the charge against Big Pharma price gouging, by requiring drugmakers that raise prices faster than inflation to pay the difference back to Medicare, which will then pass savings on to consumers. This will protect over 750,000 seniors, who could save as much as $4,500 per over-priced dose. Democrats will keep fighting to expand these rebates, applying them when drugmakers overcharge not just Medicare, but private insurers as well. We're also cracking down on improper drug patent listings, which some drugmakers use to shut out competition. Once companies drop their improper patent listings, other companies will be free to make cheaper alternatives. The FTC's work in this area has already pushed three of the biggest makers of inhalers to lower prices to $35 a month, saving people with asthma hundreds of dollars a year. The Administration also enacted rules to finally make hearing aids available over-the-counter, saving millions of Americans up to $3,000 a pair. And Democrats will continue the Administration's work to require that any drugs developed with taxpayer dollars be available to taxpayers, including at reasonable prices. Democrats will keep working to lower drug prices by requiring more transparency from the \"pharmacy benefit manager\" middlemen who generally decide which drugs are covered by insurance and bought by doctors, and how much they cost.\nAll these actions will benefit family budgets. And they'll boost the federal budget, too – reducing the deficit by $160 billion over the next ten years, as Medicare no longer has to pay Big Pharma exorbitant prices.\nEvery Democrat in Congress voted for the Inflation Reduction Act, the historic law behind these savings. Every single Republican voted against it – against $35 insulin for seniors, against Medicare negotiating lower prices, against saving millions of seniors' money on life-saving drugs. Now, Trump and his MAGA allies are promising to repeal it entirely, and to funnel our savings back into Big Pharma's pockets. We won't let that happen.\nCHILD CARE, HOME CARE, & PAID LEAVE\nChild & Home Care\nThe United States can't have the best economy in the world without strong support for caregiving. But today, the cost of care is too high, pay for care workers is too low, and families are caught in the middle of a broken system. Democrats understand that fixing the caregiving crisis cannot wait.\nDuring the pandemic, Democrats' American Rescue Plan kept 220,000 child care centers open, getting parents back to work and saving families an average $1,250 a year per child. It preserved a million care workers' jobs, and increased their pay by 10 percent. It expanded support for home- and community-based services for seniors and people with disabilities.\nAnd not a single Republican voted for it.\nLast year, President Biden issued a historic executive order directing agencies to further expand access to affordable care. The Administration also capped child care costs for 100,000 low-income families at 7 percent of their income, saving each an average $2,400 a year. Overall, the Administration increased federal child care funding by 50 percent.\nDemocrats will make investments like these permanent, and guarantee affordable, quality child care to millions of working families for less than $10-a-day per child. And we'll restore the expanded Child Tax Credit and strengthen Head Start. For seniors and people with disabilities, Democrats will improve and expand home- and community-based services, working toward finally eliminating the 700,000-person Medicaid waiting list, so more people can live and work with dignity in their own communities. We'll also keep pushing to improve pay and benefits for care workers, for example by fighting to get many of them a bigger share of Medicaid home care payments. Democrats will overhaul the quality of care and quality of life for our nation's 1.3 million nursing home residents by defending Administration regulations that require minimum staffing standards at nursing homes.\nDemocrats are the only party with a plan to expand access to care, and to make it more affordable and accessible for all. Trump and his MAGA allies in Congress have voted repeatedly to increase the cost of care, for example by slashing Head Start and child care programs, eliminating slots for half a million kids. Trump has no plan to lower child care or home care costs for American families. Instead, House Republicans have promised to slash Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program, while their continued efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act will strip millions of seniors and people with disabilities of life-changing home support.\nPaid Leave\nAmerica is the world's only advanced economy not to guarantee paid leave. The vast majority of employers don't offer it – nearly three-quarters of private-sector employees don't have paid family leave through their jobs, including 94 percent of America's lowest-paid workers. The pandemic only made the economic consequences of this failure more devastating. In the United States of America, no one should have to choose between caring for a parent who raised them, a child who depends on them, and the paycheck that they need to survive.\nTrump and Republicans failed to guarantee any new paid leave to private sector workers. Instead, their various proposals included unfunded mandates on states, tax credits that failed to expand access but subsidized large businesses, and schemes to force new parents seeking paid leave to borrow against their own future Social Security funds.\nFrom Day One, President Biden has pushed to do more. He fought to include a comprehensive paid leave program in legislation that ultimately became the Inflation Reduction Act. He instructed federal agencies to expand access to paid and unpaid leave for federal employees. He expanded the Military Parental Leave Program, so all active-duty, new-parent servicemembers can take 12 weeks. And his budget includes the strongest paid leave proposals in history, permanently funding the national paid leave plan that America needs.\nThat plan will create America's first, full, national paid family and medical leave program, guaranteeing every American worker up to 12 weeks of paid time off to care for a new child or loved one to recover from an illness, in cases of domestic violence, or military deployment. It will help families care for one another, and it will help businesses retain valuable talent and small businesses to compete. Millions more parents will be able to work, and it will add hundreds of billions to our economy. Democrats have pushed for this for decades. It's past time that America caught up with the rest of the world.\nGAS & GROCERIES\nWhen the pandemic crushed supply chains, prices for everyday items, from food to gas to airfare, went up. But after supply bottlenecks eased, many companies didn't lower prices in line with their falling costs. President Biden will keep calling those companies out for price gouging, and hold them accountable when they don't pass savings on to consumers.\nTo lower prices, Democrats will also keep working to boost supply, fix supply chains and promote competition, especially for essential items like gas and groceries that families depend on.\nThrough record energy production of clean energy, oil, and gas, we've lowered prices at the pump for American families. The Administration also released nearly 200 million barrels of gasoline from the Strategic Petroleum and Northeast Gasoline Supply reserves; and it is lowering gas prices by up to 25 cents per gallon more in certain markets, particularly in the Midwest, by making cheaper, E15 ethanol-blended gasoline available each summer. And, the Administration is cracking down to prevent collusion by oil companies that could raise prices more.\nThe President also knows the frustration and fear that high grocery prices can cause, and he has taken action to lower costs for hard-working families. He and his team have met repeatedly with grocery CEOs and business leaders, who agreed this spring to lower prices. The Administration is also cracking down on price gouging and promoting competition in agriculture, making everything from fertilizer to poultry processing more affordable for farmers. The President also signed into law the bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act, which lowers shipping prices and helps American farmers export their goods.\nTrump and his MAGA allies fought these changes all the way, siding with Big Oil and special interests over working families. Instead of standing up to them, Trump just wants to give them another massive tax cut.\nCORPORATE GREED\nToday, corporate consolidation is allowing companies to keep raking in historic profits, while continuing to raise prices for working families. In the two decades before President Biden came to office, three-quarters of American industries grew more concentrated. As the President often says, capitalism without competition isn't capitalism, it's exploitation. And the American people are tired of being played for suckers.\nThe Administration has taken historic steps to boost competition across our economy, in fields from finance and farming to technology and transportation. We're banning non-compete agreements so that workers have the freedom to pursue a new job or start a new business. We're protecting consumers from unfair hidden \"junk fees\" and price gouging, and shoring up our banking system to keep people's hard-earned savings safe.\nDuring his first months in office, the President launched a Competition Council tasked with coordinating and advancing this work. Agencies have taken dozens of actions to increase competition across markets and industries – from making hearing aids available over the counter, to reducing cargo and rail shipping costs for goods, to support efforts to allow farmers and other Americans to repair their own equipment. The Justice Department and the FTC have increased antitrust enforcement, releasing updated merger guidelines, and halting a slate of big mergers in the airline, food, and defense sectors that would've increased consumer prices.\nDemocrats will keep working to make the American economy more competitive for businesses and workers across sectors, from transportation to housing to food. And we will reform hiring and procurement processes across the government, to boost competition among our contractors and suppliers, too.\nThe Administration is also taking broad action to crack down on \"junk fees,\" the hidden charges that companies add on to people's bills without their knowledge, reducing consumer choice. We've already taken action to crack down on a range of these junk fees charged by airlines, internet providers, hotels, and apartment buildings. We've pushed banks to slash unfair overdraft and bounced check charges and took action to cap credit card late fees. We're cracking down on junk health insurance plans that advertise one rate, but then stick patients with a much bigger medical bill. Over time, these combined actions will save American families hundreds and even thousands of dollars a year – adding up to more than $20 billion a year across the economy – giving people a little more breathing room. And we'll keep pushing until we ban all junk fees across our economy.\nDemocrats are also working to shore up a safe, secure banking system that protects consumer deposits and holds investors accountable. Democrats have pushed for legislation to hold executives at all failed banks accountable, clawing back compensation and banning them from the industry. We're working to limit out-of-control Wall Street bonuses that encourage risky bank practices that jeopardize our whole economy. And we'll keep pushing to pass an updated Glass-Steagall Act, more clearly separating commercial and investment banking and expanding Volcker rule safeguards. We defeated Republican efforts to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at the Supreme Court this year; we'll continue to protect and strengthen that agency and support its critical work.\nHOUSING\nA home is more than a roof over your head, it's a place to raise your family, to build community, and to grow the American Dream. It's also the biggest investment, and the biggest monthly expense, that most people ever face. Some 15 years after the subprime mortgage crisis devastated homeowners and froze construction nationwide, we're still seeing the effect of a severe housing shortage that's pushing up prices and keeping homes out of reach.\nPresident Biden has taken historic steps to help Americans rent, buy, and build. In the depth of the pandemic, the American Rescue Plan kept 8 million families in their homes nationwide by preventing foreclosures and evictions. Since then, the Administration has eased rising rents by capping rent hikes in 2 million federally-funded apartments. It led the biggest expansion of rental assistance for low-income families in 20 years. It's cracking down on slumlords who don't play by the rules. The Administration has reduced mortgage-insurance premiums on federally-backed loans for 700,000 homeowners; and waived the requirement for title insurance, saving families up to $1,500 to refinance.\nThe relief is helping. More people own homes today than did before the pandemic, and we're seeing fewer foreclosures than at any time in decades. But Democrats know the surest way to bring housing costs down long-term is to build to boost supply. So the Administration is cutting red tape to help more builders get federal financing. A record 1.7 million new housing units are under construction today nationwide.\nGoing forward, the President has laid out one of America's most ambitious housing plans in over 50 years. It expands rental assistance to a half-million new households, including to low-income veterans and young people aging out of foster care. It offers corporate landlords a basic choice for the next two years: either cap rent increases at 5 percent, or lose a valuable federal tax break. It offers a $10,000 mortgage-relief tax credit to first-time homebuyers, and $25,000 in down-payment assistance to buyers from families where no one has ever before owned a home. At the same time, the Administration is going after unfair rental \"junk fees,\" like fees people are charged just to pay rent online or to receive sorted mail. And, we will crack down on corporate landlords who are gouging tenants, for example by capping the amount they can raise the rent each year; and we will go after negligent landlords who don't maintain basic habitability standards. We will also crack down on those who violate the Fair Housing Act, and on landlords who discriminate against low-income and minority renters and people with housing vouchers. We are rooting bias out of the home appraisal process, which perpetuates the racial wealth gap by unjustly undervaluing millions of Black- and Latino-owned homes.\nThe President's plan also calls for funding to help build or renovate 2 million homes nationwide – by expanding the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit for developers to build affordable rental housing; and by introducing a new Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, the first ever to focus on creating affordable housing not for renters, but for homeowners. It also creates a Housing Innovation Fund, to help state and local governments find new ways to increase supply, like by converting empty office or hotel space into apartments.The plan also encourages state and local efforts to take on barriers to building new housing.\nDemocrats are dedicated to increasing the supply of an array of housing options like duplexes, triplexes, and townhomes that bridge the gap between single-family homes and large apartment buildings. By reducing barriers to building housing and providing federal tax incentives for the development of housing for people of all incomes, we can foster vibrant, inclusive communities where people from all walks of life can find affordable, diverse living options. Workforce housing must also be prioritized to ensure that our nation's teachers, nurses, firefighters, and other essential workers can afford to live in the communities they serve. We recognize that these workers are the backbone of our society, but they are left to struggle with housing costs that outpace their incomes, leaving them unable to live near their workplaces. Democrats will meet this challenge head-on by increasing funding for programs that support the creation and preservation of affordable housing options for essential workers, as well as collaborating with state and local governments to accelerate the development of workforce housing, ensuring that our communities remain accessible and affordable for all.\nDemocrats are working to help Americans cover other housing-related costs, like utilities. Families are already saving thousands of dollars with clean energy tax credits; and 23 million households received free or monthly discounts, saving $30 to $75 per month on high-speed broadband through the largest internet affordability program in history. It expired in May, because Republicans refused to act; but Democrats will keep fighting to reinstate it. We'll keep working to expand other programs that reduce home heating, cooling, and water bills as well, especially in rural areas; and to speed the transition to cheaper renewable energy, like solar, that will lower people's bills long-term.\nThe Administration is also leading one of America's most ambitious efforts to prevent homelessness. Based on a \"housing first\" principle, it's helping states and cities prioritize housing as the foundational step in delivering support, services, and jobs to rebuild lives. The Administration will work with Congress and local jurisdictions to increase supportive and interim housing options, and the services necessary to help unhoused individuals stay permanently housed.\nInstead of trying to solve the problem, Trump has made it worse. Trump has never done anything to ease America's long-standing housing shortage. In fact, he and his allies benefit directly from the housing shortage. The higher the rent, the more that he and his rich real-estate friends earn. For decades, he made a career of inflating rents and putting homeownership out of folks' reach. As a landlord, he was sued for race-based housing discrimination; and he was accused of cutting off tenants' water and heat, to push them out and charge new tenants more. As President, he tried every year to triple rent for low-income Americans in subsidized housing, including the elderly and people with disabilities; and to gut policies that help Black and Latino families access fair housing.\nNow, Trump and his MAGA allies are vowing to gut President Biden's historic work. Senate Republicans this spring blocked a bipartisan bill that would've provided tax credits to build 200,000 affordable homes; and they've repeatedly tried to cut affordable housing and rental assistance programs, preferring to protect tax breaks for corporate landlords like Trump instead. They will weaken the independent agencies that protect consumers from rent gouging, and they will make it harder for working families to buy a home, by reinstating higher mortgage insurance premiums, and by privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a windfall to hedge funds.\nEDUCATION\nDemocrats fundamentally believe that every student deserves a quality education, regardless of their parents' zip code or income.\nWe know that education starts well before kids go to kindergarten. Studies show that children who attend preschool are nearly 50 percent more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a two- or four-year degree, no matter their background. That's why Democrats will provide free, universal preschool for four-year olds, saving the families of 5 million children $13,000 a year.\nIn the wake of the pandemic, that's especially urgent. The American Rescue Plan made the biggest investment in public education in history, providing $130 billion to help 15,000 districts reopen, rebuild, and catch kids up; funding that has worked to help our children learn. The historic investment spurred long overdue improvements in school facilities and indoor air quality, creating safe and healthy learning environments for students and school staff. Since then, we've also provided an additional $2 billion to high-need, Title I schools. We've helped districts nationwide train and hire 14,000 more counselors and social workers, so kids can heal from the disruptions of COVID, and cope with the fear of gun violence in order to focus on learning. We increased investments in full-service community schools five-fold, providing health care, nutrition, job training, and other wraparound services for kids at school, investing in their futures and making families' lives easier.\nThe Administration supports a multitude of approaches that have been proven to help students learn: reducing chronic absenteeism by building social and emotional supports at schools, offering literacy programs, and setting high expectations for student attendance; providing intensive tutoring; extending the school day and school year; expanding community schools; and helping schools to lift student achievement, rather than punishing them based on state standardized tests. We support fully funding IDEA to prioritize students with disabilities and the special educator workforce. We support efforts to provide more timely, well-rounded, actionable feedback on student learning and progress to educators and to families that will support instruction and student success, while upholding rigorous academic standards. We oppose the use of private-school vouchers, tuition tax credits, opportunity scholarships, and other schemes that divert taxpayer-funded resources away from public education. Public tax dollars should never be used to discriminate. And we'll continue working to increase accountability at charters, holding them to the same transparency standards as public schools. We'll prioritize education in cutting-edge STEAM fields as well, especially for students from underrepresented communities, preparing every child to compete and thrive. And we're working to provide every student with a pathway to multilingual education, while ensuring equitable access to a high-quality education for English learners, who've historically been underserved.\nA quality, postsecondary education used to be a ticket to the middle class, but the cost that many folks face for higher education today is crippling families, futures, and our entire economy. It has become a barrier to opportunity. Democrats will make quality, affordable, postsecondary education a path forward again.\nFour year college is not the only pathway to a good career, so Democrats are investing in other forms of education as well, including career and technical education. The Administration is expanding job training partnerships that connect high schools, local businesses, and labor unions to prepare students for good jobs in high-skill, high-wage, and in-demand industries. It'll make trade school and community college free for every American. And it's making record investments in registered apprenticeships – which already train more than one million Americans a year across industries, including cutting-edge industries. Some 90 percent of them stay on as full hires, earning an average starting salary of $80,000 a year. That's a path to the middle class that families can count on.\nA majority of college students graduate with student debt. It can be an overwhelming stress, as snowballing interest follows folks for decades, defining the choices they make and the jobs they take, and holding back our entire economy. Although Republican appointees on the Supreme Court blocked the President's initial student debt relief plan for 40 million borrowers, he has not stopped using every available tool to provide relief. His Administration already approved the cancellation of $167 billion in loans for nearly 5 million borrowers, including nearly a million public servants like teachers, nurses, and police; and it has outlined plans to deliver relief to 30 million borrowers in all. Meanwhile, its new SAVE plan is the most affordable student-loan repayment plan in history, helping 8 million Americans – including more than 4.5 million who now have a $0 monthly payment. These savings will transform lives, freeing people to buy a house, to start a family, or to launch a business with new hope.\nFor young people just heading to college now, we've already secured the largest increase in Pell Grants in a decade, and we'll further expand these grants to 7 million more students, and double the maximum award by 2029. We've invested a record $16 billion in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); and we're working to subsidize tuition at all Minority Serving Institutions for anyone whose family earns less than $125,000 a year.\nWhile Democrats work to make the promise of education available to everyone, Trump just sees school as another opportunity for a scam. Trump University not only conned thousands of people into buying worthless degrees, it saddled them with thousands in debt. And, not only are Republicans trying to block our student debt relief, they are slashing funding for job training that ensures workers can access good paying jobs without a four-year degree.\nAt the same time, Democrats have educators' backs. Teachers, education support professionals, paraprofessional and school-related personnel, and specialized instructional support personnel are the heart and soul of our communities; they give so much of themselves, and inspire our children to dream. The Administration has canceled student loan debts for more than 942,000 public servants, including educators. Public school educators also deserve a raise. We'll recruit more new teachers, paraprofessionals and school related personnel, and education support professionals, with the option for some to even start training in high school; and we'll help school-support staff to advance in their own careers with a living wage. We will improve working conditions and support to help make teaching a sustainable and affordable profession. We'll keep investing in partnerships with HBCUs, MSIs, and Tribal Colleges and Universities to strengthen and diversify the teacher pipeline, so students of every background can see themselves at the head of the classroom and in charge of their schools.\nSOCIAL SECURITY, PENSIONS, & MEDICARE\nThe right to a secure and dignified retirement is one of the bedrock principles of American life. Before Social Security, almost half of American seniors lived in poverty. Even those who'd spent a lifetime working didn't always have enough to put food on the table or health care they could count on. Democrats changed that: in 1935, we passed Social Security; in 1965, we signed Medicare and Medicaid into law. These are more than government programs – they're a promise that we've made as a country, that after a lifetime of hard work, people deserve to retire with dignity and security. They've made tens of millions of lives better.\nTrump and his MAGA allies are shredding that sacred trust, and saying they'll cut Social Security to give billionaires another tax cut. Trump has called Social Security a \"Ponzi Scheme\" and warned \"there's a lot you can do in terms of cutting.\" As President, he tried to slash both Social Security and Medicare programs in every budget, and to gut Medicaid, which provides home care to over seven million seniors and people with disabilities. House Republicans have vowed to cut Social Security by over $1.5 trillion, to raise the retirement age, and to transform Medicare into a voucher-like system, threatening the program. Trump will also eliminate protections for private retirement savings, by undermining the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and making it easier for banks to rip off seniors with expensive, hidden fees.\nDemocrats won't let that happen. Generations of Americans have paid into these programs, with every paycheck of their lives. We'll never back down from our ironclad commitment to protecting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. We reject any effort to privatize Social Security or to cut any of the benefits that the American people have earned. Middle-class Americans pay 6.2 percent of their income to support Social Security, and the self-employed pay twice that. But people with multi-million dollar incomes pay a fraction of 1 percent. We'll strengthen the program and expand benefits by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share. We also oppose any actions to cut Medicare benefits. We'll look to expand traditional Medicare coverage to include dental, vision, and hearing services, which are so key to health and quality of life, by making the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share.\nThe fact is that both Social Security and Medicare are in a stronger fiscal position today than when President Biden took office. Our strong economic recovery has helped to extend Medicare solvency by a decade. And the President's prescription drug reforms will save it hundreds of billions of dollars, by finally empowering Medicare to directly negotiate lower prices with drug companies, and to collect rebates if Big Pharma hikes prices faster than inflation. If Republicans repeal our reforms, they'll erase those savings and put Medicare itself at risk. Democrats will make Medicare permanently solvent, by making the wealthy pay their fair share in Medicare taxes.\nDemocrats will stand firm to protect retirement security across the board. In 2021, we passed the Butch-Lewis Act, preserving the pensions of 3 million union workers and retirees who would've seen deep cuts, and reversing pension cuts for over 100,000 workers. Going forward, we'll amend federal bankruptcy laws to make sure no other retirees ever run that same risk. The Administration is also cracking down on junk fees in retirement savings, and reversed a Trump-era rule that had allowed financial advisors to put their own interests before their clients'. Democrats want to make it easier for everyone to save for retirement and retire with dignity.\nChapter Four: Tackling the Climate Crisis, Lowering Energy Costs, & Securing Energy Independence\nEvery year, the devastation caused by climate change grows more urgent. Across the country, Americans experience the dire impacts of climate change: Floods and storms wipe more homes off the map. Wildfire smoke spreads thousands of miles, forcing millions to shelter indoors. We've had the worst droughts in a thousand years, and the fastest sea-level rise in over a century. Last year was Earth's hottest on record. Natural disasters and extreme weather have cost America over one trillion dollars in damages in just the last seven years. And they hit the most vulnerable among us hardest – seniors, people with disabilities, people in neighborhoods without resources to blunt the impact.\nThe climate crisis is decades in the making, an existential threat to future generations who deserve better. It's a consequence of delay and destruction by people like Donald Trump and his friends in Big Oil, who still deny what we all see happening right before our eyes.\nPresident Biden is delivering on the most aggressive climate agenda in history. His landmark legislation has unleashed a clean energy boom that's slashing pollution, lowering energy costs, and has already created over 300,000 good-paying American clean energy jobs. America is now producing more energy than ever in its history. He has taken more environmental actions than any president before him – providing cleaner air and water, making communities more resilient, and forcing polluters to pay for the damage they've done. He is on track to protect more of America's lands and waters than any president before him, and he has restored our global climate leadership. He is positioning America to lead the future – energy independent, resilient, innovative, and strong.\nTrump is only interested in himself and his wealthy donors, who got rich polluting our country. As president, he gutted more than 125 environmental policies that had protected the American people from toxic pollution, everywhere from sewage plants, to oil and gas fields, to our own homes. He pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement at Big Oil's urging, weakening America's role in the world. He fired scientists from federal agencies, replacing them with oil and gas lobbyists who rewrote our nation's environmental rules. And he handed oil companies $25 billion in tax breaks.\nNow, Trump is set to do Big Oil's and polluters' bidding again. He told oil executives he'd reverse our climate progress and slash their taxes once more – if they'd give him $1 billion for his campaign. Oil and gas lobbyists are already drafting executive orders for him to sign on day one. He wants to roll back the clean energy progress that President Biden has made, gut the Environmental Protection Agency, and let polluters dump dangerous PFAS chemicals in our water. His MAGA allies have tried 42 times to repeal our landmark climate law. If they succeed, they'll eliminate tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, drive up home energy costs, sicken thousands of Americans with toxic pollution, and cede the race for the future to China.\nPRODUCING CLEANER, MORE AFFORDABLE ENERGY\nAcross the world, we're seeing massive new clean energy production and uptake. We're at the dawn of a new era that will redefine the global economy, and that America must lead.\nPresident Biden's Investing in America agenda makes the largest clean-energy investment in history; and it has already attracted over $400 billion in private sector commitments, to develop and manufacture solar, wind, battery, and other clean technologies here at home. Today, 585 new clean energy manufacturing projects are underway – not just on the coasts, but in 47 states, including in places too often left behind. Some 81 percent of the investments made since our landmark climate law passed are going to counties with below-average weekly wages.\nAmerica is making leaps forward in energy generation and storage, while modernizing our electricity grid and upgrading transmission lines to deliver reliable, clean power. Private sector companies have announced investment in solar modules that will power 18 million homes; and the Biden-Harris Administration has approved the first nine commercial offshore wind projects in federal waters, set to power nearly 5 million homes. Large-scale energy storage capacity has increased twelve-fold since the President took office, and is expected to double again by year's end.\nThis clean energy boom has already created over 300,000 jobs and lowered energy costs for millions of families. It puts us on track to triple clean-energy generation by 2030, reducing Big Oil's hold on our economy, protecting families from wild price swings, and bringing America closer to energy independence than we've been in over 70 years.\nGoing forward, Democrats will keep working to incentivize investment in transmission upgrades and new lines, and in the grid-component manufacturing that's needed to support that growth. We will improve and speed up the processes of environmental review and clean-energy permitting; and further scale up development of clean energy on public lands.\nWe'll also continue to invest in clean energy research and development, building on America's legacy as a nation of new frontiers and possibilities. To help find new ways of generating and storing energy, reducing emissions, and boosting climate resilience, we'll launch an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Climate (ARPA-C), modeled on the defense research agency that's behind breakthrough technologies like the internet and GPS, and the new ARPA-H that the Administration created to transform medicine. We'll also establish a new national lab for climate research and innovation, affiliated with an HBCU, Hispanic-, or other Minority-Serving Institution, to ensure the opportunities of the future are available to everyone, and built by everyone. And we will continue to invest in climate research across NASA, NOAA, the National Science Foundation, and other agencies, to make sure that America leads the world in clean energy innovation.\nLOWERING ENERGY COSTS\nDemocrats' historic climate and clean energy agenda is lowering energy costs for families and small businesses long-term and today – with cheaper, cleaner energy and with tax credits to make home energy use more efficient and affordable. America's clean energy boom is giving everyone more energy choices than ever, and more choices mean lower prices. According to the Department of Energy, our policies are expected to slash overall electricity rates by 9 percent and gas prices by as much as 13 percent by 2030, saving Americans tens of billions of dollars.\nAt the same time, the Inflation Reduction Act is providing tax credits and rebates to make Americans' homes more efficient, so families can immediately start saving on their energy costs, now and for years to come. Families can reduce their bills up to $2,000 a year by making their homes more energy efficient with new insulation, windows, and doors; and by installing rooftop solar panels, home battery storage, and electric pumps for heating and cooling. Democrats are also offering rebates on new, energy-efficient appliances; and people can save up to $7,500 when they buy a new plug-in hybrid or fully electric car, or $4,000 if they buy a used one.\nThe Administration has toughened efficiency standards on new appliances and cars as well, which will further reduce emissions and energy bills. New fuel economy and tailpipe standards alone are expected to save drivers some $6,000 per car by reducing fuel and maintenance costs.\nThe Administration has also taken historic action to lower gas prices at the pump, by standing up to Big Oil's price gouging, releasing strategic reserves to blunt profiteering, and promoting competition with cleaner, cheaper, renewable fuel.\nCREATING CLEAN ENERGY JOBS\nPresident Biden has long said that when he thinks about climate change, he thinks about jobs. Good-paying union jobs that people can raise a family on. As President, he's delivering. The clean energy manufacturing and deployment boom ignited by his landmark climate law has so far directly created over 300,000 jobs in communities nationwide; and we're making sure those jobs meet rigorous worker and environmental safety standards. The legislation is helping to push American factory construction to an all-time high as well, as we build new plants to make things like batteries and electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines, and bring the supply chains needed to power a clean energy future home.\nThe President's agenda also includes extended Buy Clean and Buy America standards, requiring federal projects to use low-carbon, American-made cement, steel, and other materials; and providing credits for private companies to do the same, creating more American jobs. It also provides extra incentives for private companies to hire registered apprentices and pay prevailing wages. Through executive action and with Congress, Democrats will continue to work to create strong labor standards for jobs created with taxpayer dollars.\nTo help prepare people for these jobs, Democrats launched the American Climate Corps, a new workforce training and service initiative that will put more than 20,000 young Americans to work on clean energy, conservation, and climate resilience projects nationwide. President Biden has set a goal to triple the size of the American Climate Corps by the end of this decade, ensuring that young people are given the skills and tools they need to succeed in careers in our new clean energy and climate resilience economies. The Administration is also making record investments in registered apprenticeships, including in clean energy industries. Registered apprenticeships train more than a million Americans a year across industries, 90 percent of whom stay on in those jobs as full hires. We're also boosting investment in STEM education and workforce training programs for women and at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other Minority Serving Institutions, to make sure the clean energy and manufacturing jobs of tomorrow are open and accessible to communities that have been too often left out in the past.\nThe Administration is also investing in new sources of income for America's farmers, and working to make our farm sector the world's first to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Under President Biden's landmark climate law, the Agriculture Department is paying farmers to adopt climate-smart practices, which sequester carbon from the atmosphere, improve soil health and biodiversity, and restore water cycles, all while opening new revenue streams from ecosystem services markets. Already, over 80,000 farms covering 75 million acres have adopted these practices.\nAbove all, Democrats will unite against the Republican war on clean energy, blocking their obsessive attempts to repeal President Biden's clean energy investments. Republicans will not be allowed to pull the rug out from American clean energy businesses, send hundreds of thousands of jobs overseas, and strip all Americans of cheaper, cleaner energy choices, all to please their special interest backers.\nREDUCING POLLUTION & MAKING POLLUTERS PAY\nThese transformative investments in American energy are lowering energy costs, creating good-paying jobs, revitalizing local economies, and reducing pollution.\nTransportation is America's biggest emitter, responsible for a third of emissions. The Administration has put us on track to eliminate all carbon from the sector by 2050. It's making generational investments in transportation infrastructure, including in cleaner shipping, trucking, transit, rail, and aviation. It issued the toughest-ever fuel economy and tailpipe standards, so new cars both get better mileage, and reduce emissions per mile by as much as 50 percent.\nWith tax credits, Democrats helped quadruple sales of electric vehicles, with the goal that 50 percent of all new passenger cars sold in the U.S. by 2030 be electric. We're protecting American children from asthma-related diesel pollution by giving school districts rebates to buy thousands of electric school buses so kids don't have to breathe polluted air. We'll keep working to electrify the nation's fleet of school buses, transit buses, and federal vehicles, including the U.S. Postal Service fleet. We'll double funding to repair and expand active transportation and public transit, reducing pollution and traffic, and connecting people to jobs and opportunity. And we'll work to electrify our ports and waterways, prioritizing progress towards a goal of zero-emissions freight.\nWe'll keep pushing to reduce emissions from America's buildings and heavy industry. We support local and state efforts to adopt energy-efficient building codes. We'll require that low-carbon materials and clean power be used in all new federal buildings by 2030, and invest in upgrading VA hospitals, federal offices, and K-12 public school and community college buildings, making them innovative, energy efficient, and safe places to learn. And we'll support investments in heavy industry, to make America the leader in clean steel, cement, aluminum, and other products.\nWe'll also keep stepping up action to crack down on other forms of air and water pollution, repairing damage done by Trump's failed oversight, and making polluters pay. The Administration has strengthened dozens of environmental and safety standards to reduce smog, soot, carbon, methane, mercury, and other toxic pollutants in our communities. After 30 years of inadequate protections, we finally banned all cancer-causing asbestos, including from homes, cars, and water filtration sites. And we prohibited the use of chlorpyrifos, a pesticide that can sicken farmworkers and children.\nWe also set America's first national drinking water standard to finally protect local water supplies from pollution with PFAS, toxic \"forever chemicals\" linked to cancer. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we're upgrading wastewater systems. And we're replacing every toxic lead pipe in America – long-overdue work that will finally guarantee that every person in the country can turn on the faucet and drink clean water.\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also includes important work to speed the cleanup of toxic Superfund and brownfield sites that have leached poisonous waste into nearby neighborhoods for decades. To cover those costs, the law finally restored a vital \"polluter pays\" tax that had lapsed 26 years before, once again collecting revenue on any chemical sold in the United States, and directing it to the Superfund Trust Fund to pay for cleanup.\nAt the same time, the Administration has greatly increased civil and criminal enforcement of our nation's environmental laws, boosting funding for the Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency, resulting in faster cleanups and tougher compliance. We support increased monitoring, transparency, and community engagement in this work.\nThroughout, we'll keep standing up to Big Oil, as our clean energy boom breaks the industry's monopoly hold on energy markets. For the first time in 100 years, we've increased the royalties that oil and gas companies have to pay to drill or mine on public lands; and we're charging at least 10 times more for the bonds that are required to hold companies accountable for cleaning up drilling sites or capping their abandoned wells, which have been left to spew methane. States and private landowners have for years charged more than the federal government does to lease their lands; it's time the taxpayers got a similar return.\nGoing forward, we'll also eliminate tens of billions of dollars in other unfair oil and gas subsidies. When windfall profiteering causes prices to spike at the pump, we'll release our own supplies to keep costs down for American families. And, when we hear of potential collusion or price-gouging, we'll hold oil and gas executives accountable.\nENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE\nFor too long in this country, too many communities have been denied the basic security and dignity that comes from having clean air, clean water, and functioning infrastructure. Too many parents still lay awake at night worrying what the rain or soil or water or air is doing to their kids. That kind of inequity goes against everything that we stand for as a nation. To finally change that, President Biden's climate agenda includes the most ambitious environmental justice actions in history, making sure that the people who've suffered most from legacy pollution can now share in the benefits.\nDuring his first week in office, the President established the Justice40 initiative, with the goal of directing 40 percent of the benefits of our historic climate and clean energy investments to fenceline communities hit hardest by past pollution. Last year, he gave the program new teeth, with an executive order requiring every federal agency to designate its own Environmental Justice Officer to consider and improve the health impacts of its work on all communities.\nEvery major plank of our Investing in America agenda shares that commitment to environmental justice. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests a record $21 billion in tackling legacy pollution, the biggest effort to right such wrongs in American history. We're also investing in capping orphaned oil and gas wells, which leak deadly methane into surrounding communities well after Big Oil is gone.\nAnd to help ensure new climate and clean energy projects can get financed across America, particularly in communities historically left behind and overburdened by pollution, President Biden and Vice President Harris launched a first-of-its-kind $27 billion national financing network as part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction fund. This program will ensure communities across the country have access to the capital they need to participate in and benefit from a cleaner, more sustainable economy as we slash harmful climate pollution, improve air quality, lower energy costs, and create good-paying jobs.\nOur climate law makes major investments in long-overdue clean water and sanitation as well. It launched a Clean Ports program to help ease the impact of air pollution around ports and airports, where thousands of trucks move goods in and out, often through neighborhoods experiencing distress as a result of historic disinvestment. It invests in clean public transit, connecting communities that have been isolated or disconnected by infrastructure and development to jobs, healthcare, education and opportunities. And under this climate law, millions of trees will be planted, deploying a nature-based solution to combat the urban heat island effect by cooling our streets and easing the deadly impact of extreme heat on people living and working in these areas. We will continue to implement the President's Executive Order on Environmental Justice for All, and will seek legislative options to further advance environmental justice.\nDemocrats also know we have a moral obligation to make sure that fenceline communities benefit from the clean energy revolution. Programs like Solar for All are helping to lower energy costs, by installing nearly a million solar rooftops in low-income areas by 2029. At the same time, we're providing bonus tax credits to draw clean energy and clean manufacturing to former fossil fuel and legacy power plant communities. They powered our nation for generations and deserve a just transition away from fossil fuels. Today, they're seeing rapid growth.\nBUILDING CLIMATE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES\nWe have an urgent obligation to make every community in America more resilient to climate change and extreme weather. A record more than 2,300 Americans died after extreme heat exposure last year, making it the top weather-related killer; while as a country, we had to build back from 28 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters. It's not sustainable.\nThe President's infrastructure and climate laws are improving our climate resilience by boosting readiness and response, including by recruiting and retaining more wildland firefighters, and increasing budgets at FEMA. And, they're preparing us to better mitigate the impact of each extreme weather event as well. We've taken unprecedented steps to reinforce our nation's infrastructure, building new roads, bridges, and ports that are less vulnerable to flooding. We're putting power lines underground, so winds can't bring them down where they catch fire. We're making our electric grids more reliable and more energy efficient, so families and businesses don't lose power in critical moments. We're restoring wetlands to help protect communities from sea-level rise and storm surge. We've stabilized the Colorado River System, which provides water for more than 40 million Americans, after the worst drought in over a thousand years. We'll continue investing in public safety measures, like resiliency and cooling centers, so everyone, including our most vulnerable residents, can find refuge during extreme weather events. And we're looking out for workers, who often risk their lives on the job in extreme weather, with President Biden for example introducing the first national heat standards to protect workers from dangerous heat last year.\nGoing forward, Democrats will work to pass the bipartisan Disaster Resilience Tax Credit, to help low- and middle-income families and small businesses invest in preparing for and easing the impact of storms, heat, floods, and other natural disasters.\nTrump refuses to admit that climate change, and any of the devastating impacts that communities nationwide, are real. His allies have promised to privatize the National Weather Service, downsize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and stop the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research from conducting climate research, making it much harder to predict when extreme weather is coming, respond or help communities recover.\nCONSERVATION\nAmerica's natural wonders are our nation's heart and soul. They unite and inspire us, and connect us to something bigger than ourselves. From his first day in office, President Biden has taken historic steps to protect, conserve, and restore them. He set our nation's first-ever national conservation goal to protect at least 30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030, including by supporting locally-led, voluntary efforts. Today, he is on track to conserve more American lands and waters than any President in history – over 41 million acres so far, including dozens of new national monuments, wildlife refuges, and other protected areas, from the Grand Canyon to the Great Lakes.\nTrump is the only president in history to have stripped more public lands of protection than he designated, opening tens of millions of acres of our most pristine national monuments to mining and drilling. The Administration has reversed that, canceling leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and prohibiting new leasing in Minnesota's Boundary Waters; restoring important protections for places like Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and Bears Ears National Monument in Utah and expanding the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument in California; and protecting places that are too special to develop, like Alaska's Bristol Bay.\nGoing forward, Democrats will increase protections for America's Arctic, and ensure clean water for all Americans by protecting rivers and wetlands. We'll protect our oceans by working to designate new marine sanctuaries, and protect coastal communities from climate impacts. We'll keep pushing to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, partnering with state and local governments; and work to reduce threats to iconic old growth forests. We'll reward Americans across the country who engage in voluntary conservation on private lands, and we'll work with landowners to protect endangered species and our economy by restoring habitats and enhancing biodiversity, and continuing to protect lands and waters as National Monuments.\nGLOBAL CLIMATE LEADERSHIP\nWith these historic actions and sustained engagement, President Biden has restored America's global climate leadership, once again making our nation the world's pivotal force against climate change. The United States rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement on day one of his presidency, and President Biden set an ambitious goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, in line with climate science. He used the restored power of America's example to press other nations to do more, persuading 155 countries to agree to slash methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas, by at least 30 percent by the end of this decade. The United States is increasing the resilience, diversity, and security of our clean energy supply chains, while making sure they reflect our values, including by creating good-paying, safe jobs for workers. The Administration has rallied the world to commit for the first time to transitioning away from fossil fuels. It set a bold new goal for nations to triple renewable energy worldwide and to double energy efficiency by 2030; and it helped to launch a new global clean-energy supply chain partnership to make that happen.\nAs Democrats, we believe the United States has an indispensable role to play in solving the climate crisis, and we have an obligation to help other nations carry out this work. America's leadership in domestic clean energy development is driving a global cycle of innovation and investment that will help lower the cost of clean energy technologies in a fair and transparent way for all nations. We believe that international climate finance is an important tool in this fight. That's why the Administration committed to achieve $11 billion dollars of climate financing a year by 2024, to help develop the international clean energy market. And it worked with other nations to achieve a landmark global goal of mobilizing $100 billion in collective climate financing by 2022, fulfilling a promise of the 2015 Paris Agreement.\nGoing forward, we'll continue to support efforts to boost funding for initiatives like PREPARE, our program to build out better early warning systems for climate impacts in critical regions of the globe. We will use America's leadership to drive global innovation and build out clean energy supply chains. We'll work through the Multilateral Development Bank to elevate climate and clean energy priorities within the global development finance system. And we'll build on our leadership in innovative debt-for-nature swaps, which have helped countries from Barbados to Gabon to restructure over $2 billion in debt so far, unlocking hundreds of millions of dollars for nature and climate investments.\nChapter Five: Protecting Communities & Tackling the Scourge of Gun Violence\nAll Americans deserve freedom from fear: to be confident that their children will come home safely from the store or the playground, and to know that their loved one will come home safely from their shift policing the streets. Young Americans deserve a president who's fighting to keep guns out of school. Women deserve a president who has worked his whole life to end violence against women. Families deserve a president who has delivered safer neighborhoods.\nUnder President Biden, in 2023 the murder rate saw the sharpest decrease in history and violent crime fell to one of the lowest levels in more than 50 years. He defeated the gun lobby and passed the first significant federal gun safety law in nearly 30 years. And, Democrats provided funding for communities to hire more police.\nDuring Donald Trump's last year in office, murders surged by nearly 30 percent, the highest increase recorded in modern history. Trump tells families traumatized by gun violence to \"get over it\" and brags that he did nothing about guns. His budgets repeatedly cut law enforcement funding.\nAmericans deserve the freedom to be safe, and America is safer today than when President Biden first took office.\nGUN SAFETY\nThe gun violence epidemic is a scourge ripping apart our communities; it is the leading cause of death for children and teens. Mass shootings at schools, grocery stores, houses of worship, dancehalls, and nightclubs, as well as daily gun violence at home and on streets, devastate American families.\nPresident Biden has been fighting and beating the gun lobby for decades, and he's continued to do so as president. With his leadership, Congress passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), the first significant federal gun safety law in nearly 30 years. It includes the first-ever federal gun trafficking and straw purchasing law, enhanced background checks for gun purchasers under the age of 21, funding to implement red flag laws, a narrowing of the \"boyfriend loophole\" to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, and new requirements so all gun dealers now must conduct background checks no matter where or how they sell their merchandise. And, the law helps schools hire and train an estimated 14,000 school-based mental health professionals, including counselors, psychologists, and social workers.\nPresident Biden also established the first-ever White House Office of Gun Safety Prevention - led by Vice President Harris - and took nearly 40 gun safety executive actions, including going after dangerous \"ghost guns.\" He launched new law enforcement strike forces within the Department of Justice to crack down on gun trafficking.\nWhile President Biden has stood up to the gun lobby, Trump is proud of doing their bidding. He stood before the NRA convention this year and said, \"During my four years nothing happened. And there was great pressure on me having to do with guns. We did nothing. We didn't yield.\" While he \"did nothing,\" gun violence spiked: Trump oversaw the largest single-year increase in murders in history, including a 35 percent increase in gun murders. He refused to limit the use of high-capacity magazines after a Las Vegas shooter used a dozen 100-round magazines to kill 58 people. And, when confronted with horrific gun violence, he told families to \"get over it.\"\nDemocrats will establish universal background checks, a step supported by the vast majority of Americans, including gun owners. We will once again ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We will require safe storage for guns. Democrats will end the gun industry's immunity from liability, so gunmakers can no longer escape accountability. We will pass a national red flag law to prevent tragedies by keeping weapons out of dangerous hands. We will increase funding to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) for enforcement and prosecution, and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for firearm background checks. And, because the gun violence epidemic is a public health crisis, we will fund gun violence research across the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) as well as community violence interventions.\nPOLICING & PUBLIC SAFETY\nPresident Biden recognizes the sacrifices police officers and their families make to keep our communities safe. Every day, officers risk their lives for the safety of people they do not know. And since Day One, President Biden has been working to make sure police officers have the tools they need to protect their communities, including more police officers on the street. We need to fund the police, not defund the police.\nDemocrats passed and President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan, with the largest-ever federal investment in fighting and preventing crime, reducing violence, and investing in public safety. That funding enabled cities and states to invest more than $15 billion in public safety and violence prevention, putting more police officers on the beat for accountable community policing, as well as interrupting and preventing crime. In 2023, the Justice Department provided $5.8 billion to state, [see APP note] local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement agencies, research institutions, and nonprofits to advance public safety – including funding for 1,730 new police officers in nearly 400 communities. Because police officers should be able to focus on fighting crime, President Biden secured the first-ever federal funding solely dedicated to community violence intervention programs; and he increased funding for crisis interventions, mobile crisis teams, and training for first responders and law enforcement. President Biden also signed legislation replenishing the Crime Victims Fund, which supports programs that assist survivors. Democrats also secured funding for extra security at places of worship and community institutions; and we are investing in Tribal public safety.\nPublic trust, as any police officer will tell you, is the foundation of public safety. Police cannot fulfill their role to keep communities safe without public trust and confidence in law enforcement and in the criminal justice system. Yet, there are places in America today where the bonds of trust are frayed or broken. President Biden took action to enhance public trust by signing a historic executive order on police reform alongside George Floyd's family. He launched the National Law Enforcement Accountability Database with information on misconduct by federal law enforcement officers, and sharply restricted chokeholds and no-knock warrants for federal law enforcement. And, the Administration is publishing data on the use of force and is also preventing certain militarized equipment from being sold or transferred to local police agencies.\nTrump oversaw the largest one-year increase in murders ever recorded. On January 6, he encouraged the rioters who attacked the police officers protecting our Capitol; since then, he has promised to pardon these convicted criminals. He is the candidate who wants to defund the police: As president, he repeatedly proposed cutting funding to state and local law enforcement programs, including the COPS program that funds local police officers, for three years in a row. He has called to defund the Department of Justice and the FBI. And, he says he will withhold federal funding from local police departments that don't adopt policies like stop-and-frisk or assist in mass deportations.\nTrump has been equally disastrous for accountable policing. As president, he reversed restrictions that limited the transfer of surplus military equipment to local police departments and effectively abandoned pattern-or-practice investigations into police misconduct. When protests followed George Floyd's murder, he tweeted, \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts\" and referred to protesters as \"THUGS,\" and tear-gassed nonviolent protesters outside the White House. If he gets another term, he will resume stop-and-frisk practices and withhold federal funding from local police departments that do not adopt this discriminatory policy. He's promising to sign legislation to broaden qualified immunity to prevent legal accountability for police misconduct.\nPresident Biden is committed to making our country safer for every American, civilians and law enforcement alike. Democrats will pass his Safer America Plan, which calls on Congress to invest $37 billion to support law enforcement and crime prevention. That includes funding 100,000 additional police officers for accountable community policing and $5 billion in community violence intervention, which will help prevent crime, keep communities safe, and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. We will create a new Violent Crime Reduction and Prevention Fund to give federal, state, local, and Tribal law enforcement the resources they need to fight crime, including to hire more agents, prosecutors, and forensic specialists. We will give communities the tools to crack down on gun crime, retail crime, and carjacking. Democrats will build on the progress in President Biden's executive order on effective, accountable policing by passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. And, we will end racial profiling and religious discrimination in law enforcement.\nCRIMINAL JUSTICE\nPresident Biden is committed to rehabilitation and reentry for people returning to their communities after incarceration, and to building a criminal justice system that lives up to those ideals and ensures that everyone receives equal justice under law. That's why he's taken historic steps to make this promise a reality.\nNo one should be in jail just for using or possessing marijuana. Sending people to prison for possession has upended too many lives and incarcerated people for conduct that many states no longer prohibit. Those criminal records impose needless barriers to employment, housing, and educational opportunities, disproportionately affecting Black and brown people. President Biden took historic action to end this failed approach by pardoning people convicted federally for using or possessing marijuana. He has called on governors to use their pardon power to do the same for state-level offenses. And his Administration is taking a major step to reschedule cannabis so it's no longer classified as more dangerous than fentanyl or methamphetamine.\nPresident Biden has released a comprehensive strategic plan to improve the criminal justice system and strengthen public safety, including more than 100 concrete actions. The Administration is improving rehabilitation in jails and prisons and helping people rebuild their lives, an important step in reducing recidivism. It has invested nearly $1 billion in job training, addiction recovery, and reentry services across the country; and expanded access to Pell Grants, so people can earn a college degree while they are incarcerated, starting over with new skills. The Administration will keep investing in housing, mentorship, job training, and apprenticeship programs as well. It is working to end the school-to-prison pipeline by reissuing guidance from the Departments of Education and Justice to prevent disparate discipline of children of color and with disabilities and incentivizing states to develop community-based alternatives to prison for young people. And, President Biden reestablished the Justice Department's standalone Office for Access to Justice to ensure that everyone can get legal assistance.\nPresident Biden has used his pardon power to right historical wrongs. In addition to pardoning simple possession and use of marijuana, he's pardoned or shortened the sentences of people convicted of other nonviolent drug offenses and pardoned approximately 2,000 gay, lesbian, and bisexual veterans who were convicted years ago just for being themselves.\nDemocrats will take action to expunge federal marijuana-only convictions. We will combat drug trafficking and expand the use of drug courts, interventions, and diversion for people with substance use disorders. We will fund a new Accelerating Justice System Reform grant program to provide jurisdictions with critical resources to foster community trust and safety, reduce inequity and justice system involvement, and alleviate burdens on police. We will expand access to public defenders and step up civil rights enforcement, including by boosting funding for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and hiring 50 new Assistant U.S. Attorneys. And, we will remove barriers to legal access, combat hate crimes, and counter cyber threats. To keep children and teens safe and out of the justice system, we will invest in after-school programs, community centers, and summer jobs. And, to ensure young people get a second chance after leaving the justice system, we will automatically seal and expunge juvenile records.\nDemocrats will end state-level use of private prisons and detention centers, and we will restrict state and local practices like solitary confinement, chokeholds, and restraints on pregnant inmates. We will guarantee access to medical care in prison and will eliminate profiteering from diversion, bail, electronic monitoring, commissaries, and reentry programs. We will support rehabilitation and education, including college programs, for inmates in prison and after their release. To help returning citizens succeed upon their release, we will boost access to transitional housing, affordable housing, mental health and substance use treatment. We will limit reincarcerating people federally to only serious violations of supervised release. And, we will work to expand \"ban the box\" so returning citizens can more easily find work, protect their right to vote, and protect their right to public services like Pell Grants and nutrition assistance.\nTrump's approach to criminal justice could not be more different. His Administration threatened federal prosecution for marijuana cases in states where marijuana was legal. As president, Trump granted fewer clemency requests than nearly every president since the start of the 20th century; and many of his grants were reserved for well-connected offenders and close friends and associates like Steve Bannon, Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, and Charles Kushner. HisAdministration cut support for halfway houses and decreased the number of federal prisoners sent to transitional housing. And, it reinstated contracts with private prisons.\nVIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN\nEnding violence against women has been the cause of President Biden's life. In the U.S. Senate, with the help of courageous and committed advocates, he wrote the original Violence Against Women Act and spent the following decades working to expand and improve it with each reauthorization. As president, he was proud not only to reauthorize this landmark law but also to strengthen it. Democrats secured the highest-ever funding level for VAWA implementation, and are distributing record funding for local prosecutors, law enforcement, and survivor advocates. Crucially, the Administration has also expanded support for Native survivors and strengthened protections for Tribal communities; improved prevention and services for survivors of sexual assault, including through the Fairness for Rape Kit Backlog Survivors Act; expanded housing protections for domestic violence survivors; and increased services and support for survivors, including survivors of technology-facilitated abuse.\nPresident Biden launched the first-ever National Plan to End Gender-Based Violence, and the American Rescue Plan provided immediate crisis intervention, health supports, and emergency services for survivors. He expanded funding for campus sexual assault prevention and is keeping students safe on campus by restoring and strengthening protections under Title IX, including explicit protections for LGBTQI+ students. He signed legislation that narrowed the \"boyfriend loophole\" to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. He signed into law new protections to support survivors and address sexual assault and sexual harassment in the workplace. And, he signed a historic executive order on sexual assault and domestic violence in the military, transferring key decision-making authority from commanders to independent military prosecutors – the most significant transformation of the military justice system since the Uniform Code of Military Justice was established in 1950.\nTrump has made it abundantly clear that he doesn't care about ending violence against women. As president, he failed to reauthorize VAWA. And, his Administration rolled back campus sexual assault protections, making it even harder for survivors to get the justice they deserve.\nDemocrats will work to end sexual assault, domestic violence, online abuse, and all violence against women. We continue to strengthen VAWA; keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers; and expand housing and legal services for survivors. To keep students safe on campus, we will work with schools to implement and enforce Title IX and end sexual harassment and assault in our nation's schools. We will eliminate the rape kit backlog. And, we will strengthen legal protections for and support survivors of deepfake image-based sexual abuse building on the federal civil cause of action established under the president's reauthorization of VAWA in 2022.\nChapter Six: Strengthening Democracy, Protecting Freedoms, & Advancing Equity\nPresident Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats know that democracy has always been America's sacred cause. Whether that's still true is the most urgent question of our time, and it's what the 2024 election is all about.\nAmerica is the only country on earth built on an idea: that all people are created equal. We've never fully lived up to that, but we've never walked away from it, either. And we won't let Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans walk away from it now.\nThe President, Vice President, and all Democrats will continue to work every day to ensure that our democracy endures.\nPresident Biden has put protecting American democracy at the heart of his presidency. When he took office, the nation was reeling from what it had just witnessed on January 6: a violent mob storming the Capitol, smashing windows, kicking in doors, attacking scores of police officers, and roaming the corridors hunting for elected officials – all whipped into a frenzy by Trump's lies, repeated over and over for months, to overturn the will of the people.\nPresident Biden spent his first term working to restore trust in our institutions, protect our freedoms, and preserve our democracy for the future. President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats have consistently made it clear that political violence has no place in America.\nTrump refuses to defend core tenets of our democracy: the Constitution, the rule of law, our system of checks and balances. He still doesn't accept the plain truth, upheld by scores of courts, that he lost in 2020, even describing himself as a \"very proud election denier\" – and he has never agreed to accept this year's results. After years undermining public faith and confidence in our elections, he has warned of a \"bloodbath\" if he loses now. He lionizes the convicted criminals who perpetrated the January 6 attack on our Capitol and brave police, calling those insurrectionists \"patriots\" and \"hostages\" while promising to pardon them.\nWe know how Trump will weaken our democracy if he gets another term. He has promised to be a dictator on \"Day One\" – and we've already seen how he fawns over other dictators. He has vowed to weaponize our government to go after his enemies and benefit his allies. He has plans to fire dedicated, nonpolitical civil servants and replace them with loyalists who will do his bidding; and he has promised to exert presidential authority over what have long been independent agencies. And to silence his critics, he suggested the \"termination\" of our Constitution. The stakes in this election for the soul of our nation are profound.\nThis election will decide whether the next generation of Americans has more rights and freedoms than past generations, or fewer. Trump and Republicans are already ripping away Americans' hard-won freedoms. Reproductive freedom, freedom from hate, freedom from fear, the freedom to control our own destinies and more are all on the line in this election.\nDemocrats will not let that happen. Together, we will continue uniting and rallying Americans across the political spectrum in defense of our democracy, and making it clear that political violence has no place in America. We will defend our freedoms, restore essential trust in our institutions, and preserve America's vital role as a beacon of democracy across the world.\nJUDGES\nOne of a president's most important duties is appointing the judges who shape our country's laws. Judges matter. They have the power to uphold basic rights or to roll them back. They hear cases that decide whether women have the freedom to make their own reproductive health care decisions; whether Americans have the freedom to cast their ballots; whether workers have the freedom to unionize and make a living wage for their families; whether children have the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water; and whether a president is above the law.\nJudicial appointments are crucial at every level of the federal bench, but nowhere more so than on the Supreme Court. The next president could appoint one, two, or more new Supreme Court justices. Those justices will determine what freedoms Americans have – or lose – for the next 30, 40, or even 50 years.\nThe choice is clear. President Biden appointed Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman ever named to the Supreme Court, who has stood up for Americans' rights and freedoms throughout her career on the bench. Trump handpicked three justices who have pushed a far-right agenda with devastating consequences. The Court's attack on a wide range of long-established American legal principles – from overturning Roe and eliminating the right to choose, to weakening voting rights and civil rights, to granting immunity for presidential crimes – in fact undermines the rule of law.\nIf he's elected again, Trump will appoint more justices in the same mold; his past Supreme Court short lists have always been stocked with far-right ideologues. Trump made clear in his first term that his goal was to appoint as many far-right judges as he could, regardless of their qualifications – even appointing to lifetime seats a series of candidates deemed \"not qualified\" by the American Bar Association. While President Biden has sought to appoint judges who look like America, three-quarters of Trump's judicial appointees were men and 84 percent were white. If Trump keeps stacking the Court with extreme conservatives, the far right will have final say over our laws for decades to come, wreaking even more havoc on our system of checks and balances and the consequences for our country will be devastating.\nPresident Biden will continue to appoint justices and judges across the federal bench who are like Justice Jackson: brilliant jurists committed to defending American rights and freedoms.\nJudges should reflect the diverse population whose laws they shape, and President Biden has appointed more than 200 highly qualified federal judges who look like America. Nearly two-thirds of the judges he's appointed have been women, and nearly two-thirds have been people of color. President Biden has appointed more Black women to federal circuit courts than every other president combined; more Latino judges have been confirmed to circuit courts than under any other president; more AANHPI judges have been confirmed than in any other Administration; and after only one term, he is already tied for the most openly LGBTQI+ judges appointed. President Biden has also chosen judges from diverse professional backgrounds, ensuring a range of perspectives and experiences are represented on the federal bench: at least 40 of his judicial appointees are former public defenders, at least 25 have served as civil rights lawyers, and at least nine have represented workers.\nIn President Biden's second term, he will continue selecting judges who will protect fundamental rights and who represent the diversity of the American experience. We will push for a Supreme Court that follows the rule of law, protects people's freedoms, and abides by the highest ethical standards.\nVOTING RIGHTS\nThe right to vote and to have your vote counted is the threshold of American democracy and liberty. Without it, nothing is possible; with it, anything is. Decades after a generation of civil rights leaders faced fire hoses and batons, were brutally beaten and even died to secure this fundamental right, it remains under assault.\nSince their first days in office, President Biden and Vice President Harris have taken action to protect the sacred right to vote in free, fair, and secure elections, especially for communities of color who have been historically disenfranchised.\nWithin the first 100 days of his presidency, President Biden signed an executive order directing an all-of-government effort to promote access to voting. Agencies have taken historic action to help veterans, college students, Native Americans, and other underserved communities register to vote.\nBecause laws are only as effective as their enforcement, the Department of Justice has more than doubled its staff dedicated to enforcing voting rights laws. And because the American people deserve to have faith in their elections, President Biden signed the Electoral Count Reform Act to preserve the will of the people and to protect against the type of attempts to overturn our elections that led to the January 6 insurrection.\nTrump has a dark and different view, with a long history of supporting rollbacks to voting rights. He has spent years undermining the electoral process and confidence in elections, and continues to spread blatant lies about the election he lost. Trump's allies in state legislatures across the country have enacted and continue to introduce laws that make it harder to vote and undermine the will of the people. Trump supported Georgia's voter suppression law, which makes it illegal to hand out water to voters waiting in line. If he returns to the White House, he will seek to eliminate early voting and mail ballots to make it harder for Americans to exercise their right to vote.\nKey to the right to vote is ensuring that voters pick their elected officials – not the other way around. President Biden has spoken out against extreme gerrymandering and harmful court decisions that perpetuate it, and he has consistently advocated for legislation that would end it and create fair congressional maps. Meanwhile, Trump opposes efforts to draw fairer maps.\nCongress must restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act and take additional steps to ensure access to the ballot box. Democrats will pass and President Biden will sign the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act to fully secure the right to vote in every state, ensure fair congressional maps for every American, modernize and secure our elections, and curtail the corrupting influence of money in politics.\nSTOPPING THE INFLUENCE OF SPECIAL INTERESTS\nToo much money flows in the shadows to influence our elections. Advocacy groups can run ads on issues attacking or supporting a candidate right until Election Day without disclosing who's paying for that ad. Too often, powerful special interests use front groups to run these ads to win at any cost. Even foreign entities that aren't allowed to contribute to political campaigns use dark money loopholes to try to influence our elections.\nTo fight back, President Biden has called for immediate passage of the DISCLOSE Act, which will require advocacy groups that run ads to influence elections to disclose donors who contribute more than $10,000, and ban foreign entities from contributing to them. Under President Biden's leadership, the FEC has also finalized a rule expanding political advertising disclaimer requirements for online public communications.\nDemocrats will also fight to strengthen public financing with small-dollar matching for all federal candidates and crack down on foreign nationals who try to influence elections. We will keep super PACs wholly independent of campaigns and parties and pass a constitutional amendment that will ban all private financing from federal elections. Democrats will end \"dark money\" by requiring full disclosure of contributors and ban 501(c)(4) organizations from spending on elections. And, to curb the influence of special interests in our elections, Democrats will prohibit corporate PACs and lobbyists from donating to anyone they lobby.\nTrust in democracy is critical to protecting democracy. Democrats will adopt ethics reforms to ensure every American can feel confident that their government is working for them, not for special interests. Democrats will enact legislation to apply similar standards to Members of Congress. Democrats will create a federal ethics commission to strengthen good governance laws, like those requiring financial and lobbying disclosure. Democrats will require all federal candidates to disclose at least 10 years of tax returns. To ensure tax dollars go to work for the American people, not for special interests, Democrats will reestablish merit-based federal contracting and ban political appointees from interfering in grantmaking. And to ensure that policy decisions are guided by what's best for the American people, not by special interests, Democrats will strengthen laws that regulate lobbying by foreign governments and lower the threshold for registering as a federal lobbyist.\nREPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM\nTrump's Supreme Court appointees overturned Roe v Wade, eliminating a fundamental constitutional right and denying women across the nation the right to choose. The extreme act of overturning Roe , which had been the law of the land for nearly half a century, has already had devastating consequences nationwide.\nOver the past two years, more than 20 states have imposed extreme and dangerous abortion bans – many of which include no exception even for rape or incest – that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy, force women to travel hundreds of miles for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors for providing the health care that their patients need and that they are trained to provide. Laws that limit access to contraception and to fertility treatments like IVF. Laws that were first adopted in the 1800s.\nMore than one in three women of reproductive age, and more than half of Black women and 40 percent of Latinas, now live under an abortion ban. Today, our daughters have fewer rights than their grandmothers.\nPresident Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats are fighting back to restore reproductive freedom for every woman in every state. President Biden signed three executive orders and a presidential memorandum to stand up for reproductive rights. The Administration is protecting access to abortion, including by creating a new path for pharmacies to dispense FDA-approved medication abortion and defending access in court. It is expanding reproductive health care for service members, veterans, and their family members. The Administration is defending access to emergency medical care, including clarifying that federal law on emergency care preempts state abortion bans, educating patients on their rights, making it easier for patients who have been denied emergency care to file a complaint, and ensuring hospitals meet their legal obligations to offer care. It is challenging threats from Republicans to prosecute people who help women travel to a different state for abortion care, and helping states expand access under Medicaid for women who travel from states with bans. We are safeguarding patients' and providers' privacy, including by strengthening HIPAA protections, cracking down on the illegal sharing of personal information, strengthening consumer data protections, and issuing guidance to protect student privacy in this area. And we are ensuring access to accurate information and legal resources, including by launching ReproductiveRights.gov and convening more than 200 lawyers and advocates to support abortion-related legal defense services.\nThe contrast between President Biden and Trump is stark. Trump handpicked Supreme Court justices he knew would overturn Roe, saying it would be overturned \"automatically.\" He's said that he's \"proudly the person responsible\" for overturning Roe, and he continues to brag about it. Trump is responsible for the more than twenty state bans that are now in effect as a result. He has said women should be punished for getting an abortion, and that states should be able to punish doctors who provide them. If he returns to the White House, Trump will ban abortion nationwide. And his allies plan to ban medication abortion nationwide, without Congress or the courts, by enforcing a law from the 1800s, including prosecuting women and doctors for sending or receiving medication abortion in the mail.\nNine in 10 women have used contraception, and Democrats are also working to expand access to birth control. Under President Biden's leadership, the FDA approved the first over-the-counter daily oral contraceptive, making birth control easier than ever to access. President Biden has also built on the Affordable Care Act to make a broader range of contraceptives available to women at no cost through their health insurance. The Administration has boosted access to free and low-cost services through the Title X family planning program, and expanded access to birth control for service members and through the VA.\nTrump's record on contraception could not be more different. Trump undermined access to contraception as president, decreasing access for millions by sabotaging the Title X family planning grant program and weakening the ACA's coverage mandate. His allies have published plans to further attack access to contraception through executive action, including by further undermining women's insurance coverage for birth control and reducing access to condoms and emergency contraception.\nThe Supreme Court's elimination of the protections of Roe has also had devastating consequences for families who have suffered the heartbreak of infertility. Each year, tens of thousands of Americans start or grow their families with the help of in vitro fertilization. IVF is enormously popular, enjoying the support of the vast majority of Americans. Yet Trump's overturning Roe opened the door to laws that rip away access to this vital care – as we saw when Alabama families had treatments halted earlier this year. President Biden has responded to attacks on reproductive care by expanding IVF access for service members, veterans, and federal employees. Meanwhile, Trump has refused to commit to vetoing the Life at Conception Act, a national abortion ban that threatens IVF access nationwide, and his allies are openly attacking IVF.\nPresident Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats are committed to restoring the reproductive rights Trump ripped away. With a Democratic Congress, we will pass national legislation to make Roe the law of the land again. We will strengthen access to contraception so every woman who needs it is able to get and afford it. We will protect a woman's right to access IVF. We will repeal the Hyde Amendment. And in his second term, President Biden will continue to support access to FDA-approved medication abortion, appoint leaders at the FDA who respect science, and appoint judges who uphold fundamental freedoms.\nWOMEN'S RIGHTS\nDespite the progress we've made since our nation's founding, there is more work ahead to knock down the barriers that stand in the way of women and girls realizing their full potential. In a country founded on freedom and equality, nothing is more fundamental.\nNo one should be discriminated against based on their sex; and we, as a nation, must affirm and protect women's full equality. Democrats will fight to make the Equal Rights Amendment the law of the land.\nWhen women thrive in the workplace, our economy is strong. Under President Biden's leadership, more women are in the workforce than ever, matching the lowest annual women's unemployment rate since 1953, with the narrowest gender pay gap on record. Democrats passed and President Biden signed the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to protect women's rights on the job, ensuring that pregnant and postpartum workers have the basic, long overdue protections they need to stay in the workforce while pregnant and as new mothers. Democrats also passed the PUMP Act, so more nursing mothers have access to break time and a private place to pump. To promote pay equity and curb pay discrimination, the Administration ended the use of salary history in pay-setting decisions for federal workers and will expand this protection to most contractors. As the President's economic agenda creates millions of jobs, he is making sure that women benefit, including through his Million Women in Construction Initiative, registered apprenticeship programs, and the Good Jobs Initiative. He has also expanded opportunities for women entrepreneurs, increasing SBA loans to women-owned businesses by 70 percent, and awarding more federal contracting dollars to women-owned small businesses than ever. And because affordable child care is critical to expanding opportunities for parents, especially women, President Biden helped hundreds of thousands of child care providers keep their doors open to millions of children and saved families thousands of dollars on child care costs. The President also signed into law new protections to support survivors and address sexual assault and sexual harassment in the workplace.\nWhile President Biden has worked to support women in the workplace, Trump weakened protections for them. He moved to block an Obama-era rule that required companies to report pay by race and gender, an important tool in the fight for pay equity. He also limited the salary threshold increase under which salaried workers were eligible for overtime, leaving behind millions of workers who would have benefited under the original rule.\nThere is more work to do. Democrats will work to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and end pay inequity not just in the federal workforce, but throughout the economy with penalties for companies that discriminate against women. And, we will guarantee affordable, high-quality child care from birth until kindergarten, with most families paying just $10 a day — and make it free for low-income families. We will protect the health and dignity of older adults and people with disabilities by improving long-term care and supporting family caregivers, and we will invest in care infrastructure by raising wages and the quality of care worker jobs. We will establish a national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program to ensure that all workers, including women, can take the time they need to bond with a new child, care for a loved one, or recover from an illness.\nWe are also closing fundamental gaps in women's health care and addressing the maternal health crisis. Women in America are dying at a higher rate from pregnancy-related causes than women in any other wealthy nation, especially Black and Native women. Vice President Harris came into office as a key leader on maternal health and continues to lead the fight for improved maternal health outcomes, elevating the issue nationally and convening experts and activists to find solutions. The American Rescue Plan gave States the option to provide a full year of postpartum coverage to women on Medicaid, increasing it from just 60 days. Vice President Harris challenged all states to provide a full year of coverage; and 46 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands now do. The Administration also expanded access to maternity care coordinators for U.S. military veterans, from eight weeks to 12 months postpartum. And, it established the first-ever national maternal health and safety standards for hospitals across the country, which include requirements that hospitals have resuscitation equipment in labor and delivery rooms and proper protocols and supplies for emergency deliveries. The Administration released a blueprint outlining other federal actions to combat maternal mortality and improve maternal health. And it launched the National Maternal Mental Health Hotline which has helped tens of thousands of women.\nFor too long, women haven't been able to get the answers they need when it comes to their health—from cardiovascular disease to autoimmune diseases to menopause-related conditions. To pioneer the next generation of medical discoveries, the President and the First Lady launched the first-ever White House Initiative on Women's Health Research, which aims to fundamentally change how we approach and fund women's health research in the United States. It includes a $100 million commitment to fund the ARPA-H Sprint for Women's Health, a $200 million National Institutes of Health-wide effort to catalyze interdisciplinary research, and more than 20 other new actions and commitments to advance women's health research and especially research on menopause-related conditions and women's midlife health. And President Biden signed an executive order to direct the most comprehensive set of executive actions ever taken to expand and improve research on women's health.\nDemocrats will continue working to address the maternal health crisis and ensure every American has access to high-quality, culturally competent care before, during, and after pregnancy. And we will continue to invest in women's health research to galvanize new research and breakthroughs on a wide range of topics.\nTrump will reverse our progress. He will repeal the Affordable Care Act, putting coverage of prenatal, pregnancy, and postpartum care at risk. And he has attacked Medicaid, which covers 65 percent of births to Black mothers and 58 percent of births to Latino mothers.\nRACIAL EQUITY\nSince Day One, the Administration has championed an ambitious equity and racial justice agenda to ensure the full and fair participation of all communities in our economy and democracy, and to ensure the promise of America for everyone, including Black, Latino, and Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Americans.\nDemocrats are building a strong economy from the bottom up and the middle out. Black and Latino unemployment has hit record lows under President Biden, and the AANHPI employment rate is at its highest since 2008. Wages are rising faster than prices, and the greatest gains have gone to the low-paid workers.\nThe ideal of equal opportunity is the bedrock of American democracy, but our laws, public policies, and institutions too often exacerbate disparities or deny equal opportunity to individuals and communities. President Biden signed two Executive Orders to change that, including by increasing access to federal contracting dollars, capital, and lending programs for small disadvantaged businesses; reducing discrimination in the housing market; protecting overburdened communities from environmental harms; addressing historic disinvestment and infrastructure neglect; addressing health and health care disparities; rooting out educational inequities and preserving pathways to equal opportunity; tackling persistent poverty and building economic prosperity in rural communities; promoting equity and fairness in the justice system; combating bias, discrimination and hate-based violence; and bolstering proactive enforcement that protects the civil rights of all Americans.\nDemocrats expanded the Child Tax Credit to millions more families, slashing the child poverty rate in half to record lows, including for Black, Latino, and AANHPI children. We'll keep fighting to make that expansion permanent. The Administration has also expanded food assistance to those in need, providing the typical low-income family of four about $2,000 more for groceries each year by improving SNAP; and it launched a summer food benefits program that serves nearly 21 million children. Democrats will keep working to increase food security, including through WIC and Summer EBT, and by bringing back the enhanced Child Tax Credit.\nStarting a business is part of the American Dream, and Democrats are working to make that possible for everyone, boosting access to capital and loans, and to business through government contracting work. Today, Black Americans are starting new businesses at the fastest rate in 30 years; and Latinos at the fastest rate in over a decade. Since the pandemic, the share of Black households owning a business has more than doubled, Latino business ownership is up 40 percent, and women own a record share of businesses. The Administration set a goal that 15 percent of federal contracts go to small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs)and will continue expanding these opportunities for SDBs in a second term. The Small Business Administration (SBA) has doubled the number and dollar value of loans awarded to Black-owned businesses, and doubled the rate of SBA-backed loans to Latino-owned small businesses. We eliminated the ban on SBA lending to people on probation or parole, and banned \"the box\" on SBA loan forms, so that people are no longer asked about their past records when applying for a loan. And, the Minority Business Development Agency, now a permanent part of the Commerce Department, is opening new offices and building partnerships with HBCUs, in its work to help minority-owned businesses across the country to overcome barriers and grow.\nThe Administration has also increased investment in Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), and issued new licenses for nonbank lenders, helping more people in underserved communities to get capital and start businesses. As part of this work, Vice President Harris launched the Economic Opportunity Coalition bringing together major corporations and foundations to align public and private sector investments with a particular focus on driving private investment in CDFIs and MDIs. By investing in community lenders, we're driving an estimated $130 billion more in loans to Black and Latino communities over the next decade. Going forward, we'll double that funding for CDFIs, and expand and make permanent a New Markets Tax Credit, to encourage development in places too long left behind.\nThe American Rescue Plan also provided $4 billion of debt forgiveness for Black and other \"socially disadvantaged\" farmers, a group that has endured decades of discrimination from banks and the federal government. Trump's MAGA allies brought lawsuits, and his judicial appointees blocked that funding, but Democrats kept pushing. They secured over $5 billion in the Inflation Reduction Act to provide financial assistance to farmers, ranchers and forest landowners who've faced discrimination; and to cover loan payments for farmers in financial distress. Over $2 billion has already been distributed to more than 40,000 people. The Agriculture Department estimates that Black and underserved farmers have benefited most.\nThe robust economic recovery that President Biden is leading is also working to close the persistent racial wealth gap that has plagued our country for generations. Today, Black wealth has climbed 60 percent since before the pandemic; Latino homeownership is higher than before the pandemic, and median Latino household wealth is up 19 percent in the last three years.\nHomeownership is one of the most important ways that families can build wealth. The Administration launched a first-of-its-kind task force to end pernicious bias in the home appraisal process, which has for too long undervalued Black- and Latino-owned homes. Since then, the likelihood that a home in a Black community is undervalued compared to a home in a white community has been cut by more than 40 percent.\nDemocrats are working to bring down housing costs across the board. The American Rescue Plan kept 8 million families in their homes throughout the pandemic; and the President has since introduced the most ambitious housing agenda in 50 years, with plans to boost supply, lower rent, and make homeownership more affordable. It includes down payment assistance for first-generation homeowners and a mortgage relief tax credit for first-time homebuyers, which will disproportionately benefit communities of color.\nWe are also working to connect communities that have been isolated from opportunity for too long. Highways and rail lines have disproportionately torn through Black, Latino,and low-income areas; displacing and segregating residents and businesses; stifling economic growth and investment; and cutting people off from groceries, jobs, and health care. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are righting those historic wrongs by investing in new roads, bridges, railways, and public transit and more,\nWe know that no child's future should be determined by their parents' income or ZIP code. We've made historic investments in education in the last four years, boosting funding for Title I and community schools, investing in thousands of new school counselors and mental health providers, and supporting efforts to boost attendance and expand tutoring and summer programs. We passed the most significant gun safety law in 30 years, an important first step toward protecting all our children from the scourge of gun violence. We're supporting students with disabilities, and working to end physical restraint and prevent discrimination, bullying, and harassment. And, where MAGA extremists are politicizing our classrooms, banning books, and trying to erase history, we are fighting back, including by appointing a federal coordinator to address the threat these bans pose to students' civil rights. We're also investing in recruiting and training teachers from all communities, including in partnership with HBCUs, MSIs, and TCUs; and helping them to get the pay that they deserve. It matters to children when they see someone who looks like them at the front of a classroom.\nDemocrats are also working to make college more affordable, and to relieve the crippling burden of student debt, which disproportionately falls on students of color. Black students take on 85 percent more debt than white peers, and both Black and Latino borrowers are more likely to hold debt many years longer after graduation, deferring their dreams to buy a home, build a family, or start a business. That's why the President's action to cancel $167 billion in student loans for nearly five million Americans, and to ease repayment for millions of others is such an important step in leveling the playing field for everyone.\nTo help more low-income students afford college in the first place, the Administration has also increased the maximum Pell Grant by $900, and will double it in the future. We're expanding access to free community college; providing subsidized tuition for children from families earning less than $125,000 a year who attend HBCUs, TCUs, Hispanic- and Minority Serving Institutions. The Administration has made historic investments in those schools, as well as in registered apprenticeships, to train Americans everywhere for the careers of the future.\nDemocrats are also committed to ending generations of environmental injustices that have left communities of color bearing the brunt of toxic pollution and climate change, decaying infrastructure, and inadequate services. The Administration is delivering on its Justice40 Initiative to deliver 40 percent of the overall benefits of our investments in infrastructure, clean energy and manufacturing investments to disadvantaged communities. Today, we're replacing every toxic lead pipe in the country, accelerating Superfund cleanups, cracking down on polluters that have poisoned their neighborhoods air, water, and soil for too long. We're making sure that every community benefits from home energy tax credits, low-cost solar panels, and other programs that can save families money while reducing emissions. And we're investing in climate-resilient infrastructure that will protect every part of this country from extreme weather and other consequences of climate change.\nDemocrats will also keep fighting to address disparities in health care and make sure every American has access to quality, affordable health care. We've continued to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act, expanding coverage to more Americans ever in history; and we're taking historic steps to lower the cost of prescription drugs — like capping insulin at $35 a month and prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for seniors — and we'll keep fighting to expand those caps for every American. We will keep pushing to provide Medicaid-like coverage to people in states that have not expanded Medicaid, and to make it easier for parents to keep children enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP. We'll defend all women's right to reproductive health care. As highlighted above, we're tackling the crisis of maternal mortality, expanding Medicaid to cover women for a full year postpartum and investing in a diverse workforce to support pregnant and postpartum women. And, we will address the disproportionate impact of infectious diseases, including HIV and Hepatitis C, and expand access to PrEP to end the HIV epidemic.\nWe have a long way to go to realize the full promise of America, but we are committed as a party to continuing the work to build a nation where all people are not only created equal, but treated equally throughout their lives. To determine how best to right historical wrongs, Democrats support Congress executing a study of reparations and the continuing impacts of slavery.\nTrump's vision for America is very different. As President, he shortchanged Black-owned businesses when it was time to hand out COVID relief funds. His tax law benefitted wealthy white Americans over everyone else. Unemployment rates soared during his presidency for people of color, while he tried to cut health care, affordable housing, and Social Security.As a real estate developer, he was sued for race-based housing discrimination and systemic violations of the Fair Housing Act, engaging in long standing racial segregation and discrimination in properties they owned and operated.\nNow, he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, ripping health care away from millions. He will gut President Biden's landmark jobs, prescription drug, and climate bills, and put a crippling import tax on the everyday things people need to get by, raising costs for Black and Latino families on everything from insulin to internet to school supplies. He will increase the racial wealth gap, by cutting taxes for billionaires and big corporations while sticking working families with the bill. He will make our communities less safe: the murder rate spiked by a record during his presidency; crime is near a 50 year low under President Biden. Trump and his hand-picked courts will continue their attacks on our rights and freedoms, eroding voting rights, the freedom to protest, and freedom to make one's own healthcare decisions. America cannot afford to go back.\nLGBTQI+\nFor generations, LGBTQI+ Americans have summoned the courage to live authentically and proudly, even when it meant putting their lives and livelihoods at risk. LGBTQI+ Americans continue to inspire and bring hope to all people seeking a life true to who they are, and to enrich every aspect of American life. But the fight for equality is far from over, as the LGBTQI+ community continues to face attacks and bigotry in states across the country. Democrats are committed to defending LGBTQI+ rights.\nPresident Biden is committed to leading the most pro-equality Administration in history. Democrats passed and President Biden signed the historic Respect for Marriage Act, enshrining marriage equality in federal law. He reversed Trump's un-American ban on transgender servicemembers and ended the disgraceful and discriminatory ban on blood donation by gay and bisexual men. On Day One of his presidency, he signed a historic executive order extending federal nondiscrimination protections to LGBTQI+ people, and he signed executive orders strengthening civil rights protections in housing, employment, health care, education, and the justice system. He pardoned service members who had been discharged for being themselves.\nAs president, Trump rolled back the LGBTQI+ community's hard-fought progress. Trump gutted Obama–Biden anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQI+ Americans and banned transgender service members from serving, overruling the recommendations of military leaders and public health professionals. And, he appointed judges who oppose same-sex marriage, have sided with businesses to reject LGBTQI+ customers, and helped implement the military's transgender ban.\nWhen a person can be married in the morning and thrown out of a restaurant for being gay in the afternoon, something is still wrong. That's why Democrats will pass the Equality Act to codify protections for LGBTQI+ Americans and their families. We will prohibit employment discrimination in the federal government, including contractors, and make federally-funded seniors programs LGBTQI+ inclusive. And we have and will continue to make great strides in protecting LGBTQI+ children and prospective parents in the adoption and foster care systems.\nPresident Biden has delivered on his promise to ban discrimination in health care on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. He has protected transgender Americans' access to health care and coverage, including medically necessary gender-affirming care; and implemented a national strategy to end the HIV epidemic in this country. Democrats will build on this progress to expand mental health and suicide prevention services for LGBTQI+ people.\nTrump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which will increase costs and rip away protections for LGBTQI+ Americans. That landmark law ensures LGBTQI+ people nationwide can access health care free from discrimination; helped reduce the uninsured rate among LGBTQI+ Americans and their family members; and banned insurance companies from denying care or charging more for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump's MAGA Republican allies are also looking to target surrogacy for LGBTQI+ Americans next.\nAs President Biden has said, LGBTQI+ youth are some of the bravest people he knows, and he has made it a priority to fight for them. The Administration is combating the dangerous and cruel practice of so-called \"conversion therapy.\" Democrats have invested in supporting LGBTQI+ youth mental health, including through the historic Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. President Biden has also taken action to support LGBTQI+ youth in foster care; and is fighting book bans that censor LGBTQI+ content. He signed an executive order recommitting the federal government to guarantee educational environments free from sex discrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. He signed a historic executive order to address discriminatory legislative attacks against LGBTQI+ children and families, directing key agencies to protect families and children; safeguard health care and programs designed to prevent youth suicide; and support LGBTQI+ children and families by launching a new initiative to protect foster youth, prevent homelessness, and improve access to federal programs. And, he established the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse to help fight online hate that disproportionately targets LGBTQI+ people, including youth.\nTrump is running on an extreme plan to punish doctors who treat transgender youth and to ban gender-affirming care, and his MAGA Republican allies have pushed a tidal wave of extreme anti-LGBTQI+ bills in statehouses across the country. Democrats will vigorously oppose state and federal bans on gender-affirming health care and respect the role of parents, families, and doctors – not politicians – in making health care decisions.\nDemocrats will continue to fight for LGBTQI+ youth by building on President Biden's historic actions to ban so-called \"conversion therapy\"; protecting LGBTQI+ children from bullying and discrimination; guaranteeing that transgender students are treated fairly and with respect at school; and ending the homeless crisis among LGBTQI+ youth.\nLGBTQI+ Americans have long faced threats to their safety just for being who they are. President Biden launched the LGBTQI+ Community Safety Partnership to provide community safety trainings, support health care providers who serve the LGBTQI+ community, and support LGBTQI+ communities to report hate crimes, and build cross-community partnerships to address hate-fueled violence. The Justice Department is taking an all-of-department approach to protecting LGBTQI+ rights. Democrats will end violence against transgender Americans, especially Black and brown transgender women, and prioritize the investigation of hate crimes against trans and non-binary people.\nDISABILITY\nPeople with disabilities have long strengthened our economy and expanded our nation's possibilities. And, groundbreaking legislation like the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act have made significant strides toward equal opportunity for people with disabilities. But there is more work to do. People with disabilities are three times less likely to have a job, and when they do, they are often paid less money for doing the same work.\nDemocrats are taking action to fix that. President Biden signed an executive order establishing a government-wide commitment to advancing equality and equity in federal employment, including for people with disabilities. The Labor Department is protecting workers with disabilities and fighting to end unjust employment practices. The Administration is helping state and local governments, businesses, and nonprofits access federal funds to hire more disabled Americans. And President Biden is making sure his Administration looks like America, appointing people with disabilities to positions all across our government. He is making the federal government a model employer when it comes to wages, accommodations, and opportunities to advance for people with disabilities. And he's helping young people with disabilities transition from education to employment through the Disability Innovation Fund.\nPresident Biden is also working to improve health care for people with disabilities. The Administration released a rule barring providers from denying medical treatments related to organ donations or lifesaving care for disabled Americans based on their disability alone. It launched long COVID clinical trials and created the Office of Long COVID Research and Practice. The National Institutes of Health designated people with disabilities a \"health disparity population,\" unlocking new resources for research. President Biden also signed an executive order increasing access to quality care and supporting caregivers; as well as historic legislation that expands home- and community-based services under Medicaid.\nAccessible public spaces are essential to ensuring equal opportunity for people with disabilities. Democrats have invested in accessible infrastructure, including rail station accessibility and actions to make airports and airplanes more accessible. And Democrats passed and President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which expanded access to affordable broadband, an especially important step for people with disabilities.\nTrump has a long record of discrimination against people with disabilities, including publicly mocking them. His business has faced a series of lawsuits for failing to comply with the ADA. Discrimination complaints from federal workers with disabilities employed at Cabinet-level agencies increased 20 percent while he was president, and in his first year in office, the number of people with disabilities fired by the government increased 24 percent, with workers with disabilities fired at almost two times the rate of workers without disabilities.\nTrump repeatedly proposed billions in cuts to Social Security Disability Insurance and called for restrictions on eligibility and benefit cutbacks. He called to cut funding for special education grants and eliminate federal funding for the Special Olympics. He has promised to close the Department of Education, threatening enforcement of IDEA protections for students with disabilities. And he rescinded guidance protecting students with disabilities, including guidance aimed at ensuring students with disabilities were not unfairly disciplined.\nDemocrats will enforce laws that ensure equal opportunity for people with disabilities: the ADA, IDEA, the Fair Housing Act, the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Mental Health Parity Act, and the Help America Vote Act. We oppose efforts to weaken the ADA and build on the ACA to prevent health care discrimination. Democrats will enforce the Olmstead integration mandate and enforce non-discrimination protections in health care, employment, education, housing, voting. We will promote equitable treatment of students with disabilities so every child with disabilities can thrive. And to support people with disabilities and their families, we will support home and community-based care and end the subminimum wage.\nTRIBAL NATIONS\nPresident Biden's relationship with Tribal Nations and their citizens is built on respect for Tribal sovereignty and self-governance, honoring federal trust and treaty responsibilities, protecting Tribal homelands, and conducting regular, meaningful, and robust consultation with Tribal Nations.\nNative communities pass down rich cultures, knowledge, traditions, and ways of life. But throughout our history, Native peoples' cultures, identities, and governments were not always seen as a part of this Nation but as a threat to it, and they faced violence and devastation that cost countless lives, tore families apart, and caused lasting damage to Tribal communities and institutions. Despite centuries of violence and oppression, Native peoples remain resilient and proud. Today, Native Americans are essential to the fabric of the United States.\nSince President Biden took office, he has helped champion a new and better chapter in the story of our nation-to-nation relationships. He appointed the first Native American Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland, and more than 80 Native Americans hold senior Administration roles. He also relaunched Tribal Nations Summit and reestablished the White House Council on Native American Affairs. He is protecting sacred and Tribal lands, including by restoring protections for Berryessa Snow Mountain, Avi Kwa Ame, and Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments. To further tribal self-governance and usher in a new era of self-determination, he signed a historic executive order that ensures the federal government respects the nation-to-nation relationship with tribes by ensuring maximal autonomy in funding and other steps.\nHe has invested in supporting Native families and communities: Democrats passed and President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan, which made the largest direct federal investment in Tribal Nations in history, along with additional historic funds in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. Democrats expanded the Child Tax Credit, pushing Native child poverty to a record low in 2021. We secured the first-ever advance appropriations for the Indian Health Service. And President Biden also defended the Indian Child Welfare Act and will continue doing so.\nFor decades, Native communities have been devastated by an epidemic of disappearances and killings, too often without resolution, justice, or accountability. President Biden is taking action to address the missing and murdered Indigenous persons crisis; the Departments of Justice and the Interior working together to accelerate investigations, DOI creating a unit to work on this issue, and FBI hiring personnel to focus on these cases. After Trump failed to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, Democrats finally did and included new protections and programs to support Tribal survivors through the expansion of special criminal jurisdiction of Tribal courts. The Administration awarded $68 million in grants to support Native communities to provide services and promote justice for survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking, and trafficking. His Administration has continued to implement the Not Invisible Act Commission recommendations to address violent crime and the high rates of people reported missing in Native communities and relaunched the North American Trilateral Working Group on Violence Against Indigenous Women and Girls. And the Administration has issued final fee-to-trust land acquisitions rules and changes to Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act regulations.\nTrump's presidency was a disaster for Native communities. Tribal communities were disproportionately harmed by Trump's disastrous response to the COVID pandemic, seeing higher hospitalization rates than other demographics. He worked to sabotage the ACA and will repeal it if he gets back to the White House. He tried to cut agencies and programs important to Tribal communities, like job training and business development funding and from Tribal scholarship and education programs.\nDemocrats will continue promoting nation-to-nation partnerships with Tribal Nations. We will continue strengthening and respect for Tribal sovereignty, the federal trust responsibility, Tribal treaty rights, and Native history, including educating the federal workforce, providing best practices for sacred sites, and ensuring Native American history is recognized. Democrats will keep working to make federal resources for Tribal Nations more accessible and protect health, education, safety, and welfare in Indian Country, particularly for Native women, children, and families. We will make IHS funding mandatory. We will invest in housing in Tribal communities, and support Tribal conservation through co-stewardship of public lands and waters. We will continue to usher in the next era of Tribal self-determination. And Democrats will invest in public safety and justice, including by increasing the number of officers and investigators on the ground; address the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous persons; and supporting VAWA programs, including a new grant program to address the missing and murdered Indigenous persons crisis.\nCOMBATING HATE & PROTECTING FREEDOM OF RELIGION\nAs President Biden often says, certain core values bring us together as Americans — and one of them is standing together against the hate, racism, bigotry, and violence that have long haunted our nation. We can and must come together regardless of our backgrounds.\nPresident Biden and Vice President Harris have taken historic action to stand up to hate. President Biden signed the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act to finally make lynching a federal crime. He hosted the United We Stand Summit, elevating the fight against hate to the highest levels of our government. He signed COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act after AANHPI Americans faced a wave of hate during the pandemic. He has sought increased funding to improve the prevention, reporting and prosecution of hate crimes. And Democrats secured the greatest funding increase in history for bolstering the security of nonprofits, including houses of worship.\nPresident Biden has been a strong and unequivocal voice speaking out against rising antisemitism in America. The Administration released the first-ever National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, outlining a whole-of-society effort, including unprecedented, coordinated, and bold actions across government agencies, and calls to action for Congress, state and local governments, companies, technology platforms, and others. As part of that strategy, the Administration clarified, for the first time in writing, that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits certain forms of antisemitic, Islamophobic, and related discrimination, including discrimination by national origin, in federally funded programs and activities. President Biden continues to take bold action to combat antisemitism on college campuses. And he has prioritized fighting antisemitism abroad by appointing Deborah Lipstadt as U.S. Special Envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism, an ambassador-level position.\nPresident Biden knows that Islamophobia has no place in our society. Across his Administration, agencies are taking action to fight Islamophobia and support Muslim Americans. His Administration is developing the first-ever U.S. National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia and Related Forms of Bias and Discrimination, including hate against Arab, Sikh and South Asian Americans. He is the first president in history to recognize the International Day to Combat Islamophobia, and his Administration released a Dear Colleague Letter reminding schools, including institutions of higher learning, of their legal obligation under Title VI to address discrimination, including harassment, based on race, color or national origin, including discrimination against students who are or are perceived to be Muslim, Arab, Sikh, South Asian, Hindu or Palestinian based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics.\nAgain and again, Trump has shown us who he is on the issue of hate. He rubs shoulders with and encourages white supremacists, even launching his 2024 campaign with a meeting with white supremacist, antisemite, and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes. He called white supremacist and openly-antisemitic Charlottesville protesters \"very fine people.\" He reportedly thinks Hitler \"did some good things\" and echoes his hateful rhetoric about immigrants, including that they're \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" He will reinstate his disgraceful Muslim ban if he's elected, continuing his long history of Islamophobia. And he fueled anti-Asian hate as the AANHPI community faced a spike in hate crimes surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDemocrats condemn the decades-long campaign to demonize the Muslim community and will end policies that target American Muslims as security threats. We will combat hate crimes and white nationalist terrorism. We will prioritize the investigation of hate crimes against trans and non-binary people. And we will continue to increase security at houses of worship. President Biden deeply believes everyone must be able to practice their faith without fear.\nThat's why Democrats will protect the First Amendment right to free exercise of religion for everyone, and we will maintain the separation of church and state. In contrast, the Trump Administration attacked religious freedom by demonizing some faiths and preferring others.\nWe will advocate for religious freedom across the world. And, we will continue to honor both religious freedom and other civil rights, not put them at war with one another. This critical work is led by Ambassador Rashad Hussain, the first Muslim to serve as Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom.\nAnd we will continue to recognize faith communities' acts of service, which are critical pillars of their communities. That's one reason why President Biden reestablished the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships — so that the government can work better with faith and community groups to serve people in need.\nFREEDOM OF THE PRESS\nFreedom of the press is foundational to our nation, and President Biden is committed to safeguarding it. That's why he has called for the immediate and unconditional release of journalists who have been locked up abroad for doing their jobs. He is taking action to combat crimes against journalists, strengthen security for independent media outlets, and provide legal support for investigative journalists around the world. And his Administration brought together a coalition to counter proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware.\nDemocrats reject Trump's denigration of the free press and recognize its importance to our society. We will strengthen media ownership rules and direct federal antitrust agencies to investigate media mergers, pushing back on the potentially harmful effects of corporate consolidation. And we will appoint an independent media professional to head the U.S. Agency for Global Media.\nARTS & HUMANITIES\nAmerica is a great nation in large part because of the power of the arts and humanities that's embedded in the DNA of America. The Administration has taken historic action to support the arts, helping libraries, theaters, concert halls, and other venues stay afloat during the pandemic. The Administration has strengthened the National Endowment for the Arts, Institute of Museum and Library Services, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. President Biden also reestablished the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities and signed an Executive Order to make art more accessible to people from underserved communities, elevate new voices through the arts and humanities, and expand opportunities for artists and scholars. He has celebrated and elevated the arts by hosting performances and screenings, and has awarded National Humanities Medals, National Medals of Arts, and hosted Kennedy Center honorees at the White House.\nDemocrats value the humanities, arts and art education for developing imagination, creativity, innovation, and critical thinking, and for building bridges within and between our communities. We will promote arts funding and education — and we will invest in the arts and humanities accordingly. Democrats will fund the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and art and music education in public schools. Democrats know that federal grants for cultural organizations, artists, scholars, library systems, museums, and state and local governments only strengthen our communities and our cultural heritage.\nD.C., PUERTO RICO, TERRITORIES\nPresident Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats have made historic investments in Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa – delivering billions for infrastructure, semiconductor, clean energy, and transportation projects, and creating thousands of good jobs.\nDemocrats reject the unequal treatment of residents of D.C., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. territories. We unequivocally support statehood for D.C., which its residents overwhelmingly support but Republicans blocked from even getting a vote in the Senate.\nDemocrats recognize that the people of Puerto Rico have earned and deserve to resolve the political status questions. For this reason, Democrats support the enactment of the Puerto Rico Status Act/H.R. 2757, and promote full civic and political representation for Puerto Ricans. We will work to end its unequal treatment by the federal government, and fight to provide equal access to federal programs like Medicaid, SNAP, and the CTC. Democrats reject Trump's failed response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico, and will ensure that the federal government's response to disasters in Puerto Rico is as urgent as it would be anywhere else in the country. When disaster does strike, we will speed access to recovery funds to help rebuild. We will build on the Administration's investments to invest further in energy, infrastructure, economic development, education, health care, housing, energy, and climate resilience. We will help restructure Puerto Rico's debt to relieve its debt burden, and we will work to dissolve the Financial Oversight and Management Board.\nDemocrats also support self-determination for the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. We will create a Congressional task force to study equal voting rights and House representation; and we will work to ensure equal access to federal programs like veterans' benefits, the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and SNAP food assistance for all those eligible. Democrats support funding to improve critical health care facilities in the territories, including construction of a state-of-the-art medical complex in Guam that co-locates health agencies on a single campus for a more integrated healthcare system that will benefit the region. We will also invest in ending disparities in agriculture, economic development, education, employment, energy, health care, housing, and infrastructure, and help the U.S. territories diversify their economies. We will help them recover from natural disasters, and we will invest in expanding clean energy and water systems to be more resilient. Democrats support reimbursing U.S. territories for more migration costs, including restoring Medicaid eligibility for legal migrants under the Compacts of Free Association. And Democrats will continue to recognize the sacrifices and honor the contributions of residents who suffered because of their U.S. nationality during the Japanese occupation during World War II.\nDemocrats also recognize that millions of U.S. citizens live abroad, and we will consider their unique circumstances and challenges when shaping policy. We will work to protect their voting rights and ensure they're able to participate in the democratic process here at home.\nChapter Seven: Securing our Border & Fixing the Broken Immigration System\nSince our founding, immigrants have traveled to America to pursue freedom and opportunity, to flee oppression, and to reunite with family members, and in turn have made our country stronger. President Biden has led with the conviction that we must secure our border and fix a broken immigration system decades in the making. Through it all, the United States must continue to be a beacon of hope and opportunity.\nOn his first day in office, President Biden sent Congress legislation to secure our border, fix our immigration system, and provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and others. This past year, the President worked across the aisle and negotiated a bipartisan deal that included the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border in decades. It would have made our country safer and made our border more secure, while treating people fairly and humanely and expanding legal immigration, consistent with our values as a nation.\nCongress failed to act because Republicans, led by Donald Trump, would rather play politics than solve problems. Trump's plans for a second term will devastate our economy and tear families apart. Trump has said that if he's elected, he'll move to immediately deport millions of undocumented immigrants, including those who have lived in and contributed to this country for years. He and his allies have also promised to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented individuals, ignore the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent and bar undocumented children from public schools, and once again separate children from their families. Trump's plans are out of line with American values, and Congressional Republicans are currently blocking President Biden's bipartisan border security proposals because they lack the courage to stand up to Trump.\nPresident Biden has led a hemispheric response to the challenge of irregular migration, launching and leading the Los Angeles Declaration for Migration and Protection with 20 countries to increase enforcement, expand legal pathways to citizenship, and stabilize and integrate migrants in neighboring countries. President Biden has taken decisive action to secure our border through executive actions that have significantly restricted eligibility for asylum at the border and created innovative legal pathways to the U.S. that, when coupled with strong enforcement, have decreased illegal border crossings. Since President Biden announced new border restrictions in June 2024, the number of unlawful crossings has fallen by 40 percent, demonstrating that the policy works. He has also implemented policies that have stopped record amounts of fentanyl from crossing our border.\nPresident Biden has done all of this while ensuring that people are treated humanely and with dignity. As one of his first actions, President Biden established the Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families, which as of March 2024 has reunited nearly 800 children with their parents in the United States that were separated in Trump's presidency.\nIn President Biden's second term, he will push Congress to pass legislation that is consistent with our values as a nation. Legislation must secure the border, reform the asylum system, expand legal immigration; and keep families together by supporting a pathway for long-term undocumented individuals, improving the work authorization process, and securing the future of the DACA program.\nPresident Biden has taken action to advance each of these goals, but lasting, comprehensive reforms require congressional action.\nSECURING THE BORDER\nThe President has already taken steps to increase border resources, working within the limits imposed by Congress. He has increased the number of agents and officers on the southwest border to over 24,000, added thousands of additional support personnel, surged thousands of law enforcement and other personnel from across the Department of Homeland Security, and secured the first significant increase of Border Patrol agents in more than a decade. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law modernized border stations and land border ports of entry. The Administration is providing support to cities and states, on the border and across the country, that are sheltering migrants. He has also taken executive actions, including launching expedited immigration court dockets, to more quickly resolve immigration cases for those crossing the Southern border and remove those who do not establish a legal basis to remain.\nPresident Biden has repeatedly asked Congress for additional resources to secure our border, including increases for personnel that are critically needed to quickly deliver consequences at the border to those who cross unlawfully. The Department of Homeland Security requested funds to hire 1,300 Border Patrol agents and 1,600 asylum officers. Meanwhile, the bipartisan Senate bill would have provided an additional 1,500 Customs and Border Protection personnel and 4,300 asylum officers. Congressional Republicans continue to play partisan politics with the security of our border instead of working with Democrats to fund these critically needed resources for DHS and border communities.\nIn President Biden's second term, he will push Congress to provide the resources and authorities that we need to secure the border. This includes additional border patrol agents, immigration judges, asylum officers, cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect and stop the flow of fentanyl, and funding for cities and states that are sheltering migrants.\nReform the Asylum System\nCongress must pass legislation to reform our asylum system modeled after the bipartisan Senate deal so that we can quickly identify and provide protection to those who are fleeing persecution and ensure it is not used as an alternative to legal immigration by others. Democrats believe that asylum processing should be efficient and fair, and that those who are determined not to have a legal basis to remain should be quickly removed. In order to achieve this, we need Congress to strengthen requirements for valid asylum claims. Congress must also finally fund a sufficient number of asylum officers and immigration judges to facilitate timely decisions. In addition, asylum seekers, especially the most vulnerable, including unaccompanied children, should have access to legal counsel. Individuals who pass this strengthened initial screening and are determined to be likely to qualify for asylum should be given quick access to work authorization while they go through a streamlined court process.\nAfter Congress repeatedly failed to act, President Biden announced executive action that significantly curtailed asylum eligibility at the border when crossings reach a certain threshold and strengthened our ability to impose timely consequences for crossing the border illegally. Those who attempt to cross into the United States unlawfully are being quickly returned to their home countries, as well as Mexico. Since the President took this action, unlawful entries between ports of entry declined by more than half. And, President Biden is changing the asylum process to more quickly screen and identify individuals who pose a threat to national security or public safety so that they can be swiftly removed.\nTemporary Emergency Authority to Shut Down the Border\nWhen the system is overwhelmed, the President should have emergency authority to expel migrants who are crossing unlawfully and stop processing asylum claims except for those using a safe and orderly process at Ports of Entry. The authority should be accompanied by humanitarian exceptions for vulnerable populations including unaccompanied children and victims of trafficking.\nCongress should also dedicate resources to detain and remove individuals quickly, and rapidly process those who cannot be detained in a non-custodial setting under government supervision. Those who pose a threat to public safety or national security must be identified and removed as quickly as possible.\nFighting Human Trafficking\nWe need more resources and Congressional authorization to increase penalties to prosecute and punish human smugglers and traffickers who prey upon families and migrants. President Biden has already taken numerous steps to go after these bad actors including by revoking the visas of private sector CEOs and sanctioning government officials who profit from migrants coming to the U.S. unlawfully, and by expanding efforts to dismantle human smuggling and prosecute offenders.\nPresident Biden also established Joint Task Force Alpha, a law enforcement task force that marshals the investigative and prosecutorial resources of the Department of Justice, in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to enhance U.S. enforcement efforts against the most prolific and dangerous human smuggling and trafficking groups operating in Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. Joint Task Force Alpha has delivered significant results, including: over 240 U.S. convictions against leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of human trafficking and substantial seizures and forfeitures of assets including cash, property, and firearms.\nCracking Down on Trafficking Illicit Fentanyl\nPresident Biden has made fighting the trafficking of fentanyl a top priority. He has seized record amounts of fentanyl at our border— and arrested more individuals for fentanyl-related crimes in the last two years than in the previous five years combined—and secured funding for more cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect fentanyl at our southwest border. He also issued an Executive Order to go after the global illicit fentanyl trade, which led to the imposition of sanctions on some 300 persons and entities. President Biden has also continued working with Mexico to extradite and prosecute key fentanyl traffickers, and negotiated the resumption of bilateral cooperation on counternarcotics with China, which had been stalled since 2019. As a result of these efforts, the number of fentanyl-related deaths has started to decline for the first time in five years.\nIn his second term, President Biden will work with Congress to deploy more cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect fentanyl at our ports of entry. He will also leverage all resources of the federal government to stop tech platforms from being used for criminal conduct, including sales of dangerous drugs like fentanyl.\nEXPANDING LEGAL IMMIGRATION & DETERRING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\nAmerica is a nation of immigrants. The legal immigration framework was last updated in 1990 and does not reflect the needs of our country in the 21st century. Many immigrants today are forced to wait years, and often decades, to immigrate lawfully to the United States. A robust immigration system with accessible lawful pathways and penalties for illegal immigration alleviates pressure at the border and upholds our values. The U.S. Citizenship Act would permanently increase family-sponsored and employment-based immigration. The bipartisan border legislation would increase the number of immigrant visas that are available by 250,000 over 5 years.\nLegal Immigration Pathways\nWhile we wait for Congress to act, President Biden has used his authority to provide orderly, legal immigration pathways for those fleeing violence, and decrease the number of illegal border crossings. The Biden-Harris Administration established a humanitarian parole process for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (CHNV), which allows people from these four countries who have a sponsor in the U.S. and who pass a background check to come to the U.S. for a period of two years to live and work lawfully. Border encounters from these nationalities decreased by 89 percent in the first six months after CHNV was put in place—incentivizing migrants to stay in place, rather than make the dangerous journey to our southwest border.\nHe also established New Family Reunification Parole Processes to allow eligible individuals from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia, Cuba and Haiti to be reunited with family in the United States while they wait to complete the process for securing lawful permanent residence.\nThe United States has long been a leader in refugee resettlement, providing a beacon of hope for persecuted people around the world, facilitating international efforts to address record displacement, and demonstrating the generosity and core values of the American people. After Trump decimated the program, President Biden rebuilt the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, which is now on track to admit more than 100,000 refugees this fiscal year, the most in three decades. The Administration also established Safe Mobility Offices in countries throughout the Western hemisphere, where migrants can be processed for refugee admission or referred to resettlement programs elsewhere - rather than making their way to our border. And, the Administration expanded opportunities for communities and individual Americans to sponsor and welcome refugees to the United States.\nPresident Biden has worked closely with partners throughout the region – including, most importantly, the government of Mexico – to undertake coordinated actions to stop the flow of migrants before they reach our border. And he has supported our regional partners through the LA Declaration process – working together on coordinated enforcement, development of lawful pathways, and efforts to address the root causes of migration.\nAs outlined in the U.S. Citizenship Act, Congress must act to increase the number of family-sponsored and employment-based immigrant visas that are available each fiscal year so that people aren't forced to wait decades for a visa. Legislation should also include provisions to ensure that children who came as dependents on their parents' temporary visas can remain in the United States with their families, even after turning 21, provisions to streamline applications of at-risk Afghan allies to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, and a process for Afghan evacuees to have their status adjusted to lawful permanent resident.\nLegislation should also extend work authorization to those who utilize lawful visa pathways so that families can more quickly get on the path to economic self-sufficiency. This includes K-1, K-2, and K-3 nonimmigrant visa holders (fiancés, spouses, children of U.S. citizens), and the spouses and children of high-skilled temporary visa holders. And, Democrats will explore opportunities to identify or create work permits for immigrants, long-term undocumented residents, and legally processed asylum seekers in our country.\nCongress should also increase the number of visas for the Special Immigrant Juvenile Status program for abused, abandoned, or neglected youth, building on actions that the Administration has already taken to provide deferred action and work authorization for juveniles in this program.\nKeeping Families Together and Supporting Long-Term Undocumented Individuals, including Dreamers\nIn 2012, then-Vice President Biden worked alongside President Obama to establish the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Since then, President Biden has taken steps to support undocumented people and families, including Dreamers and DACA recipients. President Biden has vigorously defended DACA against legal challenges in the courts, and has extended Affordable Care Act coverage to DACA recipients for the first time. In addition, President Biden is taking action to make it easier for Dreamers, including DACA recipients, who have earned a higher education degree in the United States and have a job offer to more quickly receive work visas. And, the Administration allowed undocumented workers in labor disputes to apply for deferred action so that they are not afraid to report violations of labor law. Trump tried to end the DACA program in his first term and will do so again if re-elected.\nPresident Biden also announced new actions to keep an estimated 500,000 American families together by allowing certain noncitizen spouses and children of U.S. citizens who have been in the country for 10 years or more to apply for lawful permanent residence—a status they're already eligible for—without leaving the country first. The average beneficiary has been in the United States for more than 20 years, and will finally be able to come out of the shadows and fully contribute to our communities.\nPresident Biden has also taken steps to preserve and expand Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for individuals from countries experiencing armed conflicts, natural disasters, or other crises, giving thousands authorization to live and work in the United States without fear of deportation for a temporary period. Since 2021, DHS – which oversees the program – has added Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Myanmar, Ukraine and Venezuela to the list of TPS-eligible countries. DHS has also extended TPS for immigrants from most countries that were already covered by TPS, including the countries that Trump attempted to terminate.\nCongress must pass legislation to provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, farmworkers, careworkers, and other long-term undocumented individuals who contribute to this country, by paying taxes and contributing to their local economies, and in his second term, President Biden will continue pressing them to do so.\nFast, Efficient Immigration Decisions\nImmigration officers have to make the right decisions, and they also have to make them quickly and efficiently. Under the Administration, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has cut processing times significantly for those awaiting work authorization and ensured that immigration decisions – including naturalization and work permit applications – are made fairly and as quickly as possible. As of April 2024, the Administration achieved the lowest wait time for naturalization since 2016 and the lowest wait time for work authorization documents from certain categories of applicants since 2017. In FY 2023, USCIS administered the oath of allegiance to more than 878,500 new U.S. citizens, including 12,000 members of the military, effectively eliminating the backlog of naturalization applications. It also reduced the median processing time for naturalization from 10.5 months to 6.1 months.\nThe Administration has also partnered with state governments and non-profit groups to host Work Authorization Clinics, which have eased the burden on American communities by helping migrants support their families and move out of emergency shelter into more stable housing options. It will also help to fund community-based organizations that host clinics to assist with immigration cases.\nTo make scheduling appointments at U.S. ports of entry safer and more orderly, the Administration launched CBPOne, a free online tool available to migrants in parts of Mexico. Scheduling appointments makes the process at our border safer and more orderly, and the advance information that is submitted to CBP creates a more efficient and streamlined process for CBP and for individuals. CBPOne has increased administrative processing capacity fivefold since its introduction.\nChapter Eight: Advancing the President's Unity Agenda\nSince the day he took office, President Biden promised to be a president for all Americans. He knows that we agree on a lot more than we disagree on.\nDuring his first State of the Union, President Biden outlined a unity agenda to make progress solving big challenges that Americans have in common: beating the opioid epidemic, tackling the mental health crisis, holding Big Tech accountable, ending cancer as we know it, and meeting our nation's sacred obligation to veterans.\nUnder President Biden's leadership, Democrats worked across the aisle to make real progress on these critical issues. We're providing life-saving treatment for opioid use disorder to end the epidemic, making historic investments in mental health care to help struggling Americans, establishing new high standards for AI safety and protecting American privacy, bringing together providers, insurers, and researchers to work toward ending cancer, and passed the PACT Act to expand health care benefits to veterans.\nDonald Trump divides us for his own political gain. He refuses to reach across the aisle to deliver results for working families, and he will cut veterans' benefits, mental health care for kids, opioid treatment, and cancer research.\nBEATING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC\nFor too long, the scourge of opioids has torn through our communities, ripping apart families and shattering lives. Our nation's opioid epidemic impacts Americans in every corner of the country, from small towns to large cities to Tribal lands. Far too many Americans have lost loved ones to addiction and overdose.\nThe Biden-Harris Administration is strengthening prevention, investing in treatment, and expanding recovery support services.\nThe Administration has increased the number of medical providers who can initiate treatment from 129,000 to 2 million and made historic investments in the State Opioid Response program to help states deliver free treatment services to over 1.2 million people and enabled States to reverse more than 500,000 overdoses. To curb opioid overdoses, the Administration is making naloxone, an overdose-prevention drug, available over-the-counter at grocery stores and pharmacies. They also took steps to increase access to naloxone at federal facilities, and ended a requirement for length of addiction before entering treatment. Democrats will continue these critical investments in life-saving medication and care for Americans struggling with addiction and most at risk of overdose.\nAs president, Trump failed to mount an effective and coherent strategy to prevent overdoses. Under his watch, opioid-related deaths spiked, and now, he's promising once again to repeal the Affordable Care Act. If he's allowed back in the White House, many Americans who struggle with addiction will lose critical, live-saving health care.\nINVESTING IN MENTAL HEALTH\nThe pandemic exacerbated feelings of sadness, isolation, and loneliness across the country and strained our health care system, including mental health services. President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats know mental health care is health care.\nFor millions of Americans, that essential mental health care is out of reach. In 2020, less than half of all adults with a mental illness diagnosis received care for it and it's worse for kids – nearly 70 percent of children who need mental health care cannot get it. That's why Democrats are taking steps to dramatically expand access to mental health care in America.\nThe Administration launched 988,the National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, which has connected nearly 10 million Americans in crisis to immediate, confidential, and free support from trained counselors. And, the National Maternal Mental Health Hotline has received more than 30,000 calls and texts, to help mothers and their loved ones navigate mental health issues. Democrats will push to expand 988 to handle increased capacity and serve more Americans.\nAt the same time, we must make it easier for all Americans to access high-quality mental health and substance use treatment by recruiting and training more professionals to deliver culturally and linguistically competent, high-quality behavioral health care; and by strengthening coverage across all health plans. And we must extend workforce development and incentive programs. The Administration is delivering $1 billion to hire or train 14,000 school-based mental health counselors – the largest investment in school-based mental health in history – thanks to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. And, it is delivering additional resources to support students who need mental health care.\nAs mental health care becomes increasingly expensive, Democrats are pushing for permanent funding for Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics, which provide 24/7 crisis care and treatment for mental health and substance use disorders, regardless of individuals' ability to pay. And, the President is calling for additional resources to connect more Americans to affordable care at work and at school.\nPresident Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats are working to ensure full mental health parity so that mental health care is covered the same as physical health care. We're strengthening mental health parity requirements and closing insurance loopholes for the more than 150 million Americans with private health insurance. And, the President is calling on Congress to expand Medicare's coverage for mental health care, applying the same parity protections to Medicare beneficiaries.\nTrump has a different vision. When he was president, he proposed cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and rollbacks of mental health funding.\nPROTECTING KIDS ONLINE, STRENGTHENING AMERICANS' DATA PRIVACY, & PROMOTING COMPETITION\nTech platforms and companies help keep us connected, inspire ideas and innovation, and create a global marketplace. At the same time, they collect, share, and exploit data; risk our children's mental health; and deepen extremism and polarization. There is growing scientific evidence for what so many Americans already know: Social media and other online platforms can affect our mental health and well-being – particularly for our kids. In addition, a handful of dominant tech platforms and companies increasingly control much of the market, allowing them to exercise enormous power over Americans' daily lives – and, too often, use that power to exclude competitors and undermine consumers and innovation.\nPresident Biden believes that all companies, including technology companies, should be held accountable for the harm they cause. The president has raised the alarm that social media and other platforms have allowed abusive and even criminal conduct like cyberstalking, child sexual exploitation, and non-consensual intimate images to proliferate on their sites – and called on Democrats and Republicans to unite on legislation to address these issues. The Surgeon General issued an advisory warning about the impacts of social media on youth mental health, noting that he cannot conclude social media is safe for children and adolescents. Democrats will pass bipartisan legislation to protect kids' privacy and to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and put stricter limits on the personal data these companies collect on all of us. And, the Administration has strengthened legal protections for survivors and victims of non-consensual intimate imagery, including those generated by AI, building on the federal civil cause of action established under the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization of 2022.\nPresident Biden has also called on Democrats and Republicans to pass bipartisan legislation to promote competition and privacy in the tech industry. Important policies include promoting interoperability between tech services and platforms, allowing users to control and transfer their data, and preventing large platforms from giving their own products and services an unfair advantage in the marketplace. We must also fundamentally reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields tech platforms from liability even when they host or disseminate violent or illegal content, to ensure that platforms take responsibility for the content they share.\nDemocrats are determined to strengthen data privacy. The President issued an Executive Order to protect America's sensitive personal data from commercial data brokers, identity thieves, and foreign intelligence actors. And, the Federal Trade Commission is cracking down on commercial surveillance and taking on technology companies for illegally retaining children's data. We must do more and update and pass the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, protect student data privacy by ensuring what is collected in schools is only used for education, and update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to protect personal electronic information and safeguard location information.\nSeizing the Promise and Managing the Risks of AI\nArtificial intelligence (AI) holds extraordinary potential for both promise and peril. While AI is helping to cure diseases, predict the weather, and transform education, it's also being used to clone voices, commit fraud, institutionalize bias, and undermine democracy.\nWe need to act now and act fast to realize the promise of AI and manage its risks to ensure that AI serves the public interest. Democrats are finding solutions to make sure that as AI's capabilities grow, we can manage the implications for Americans' rights, safety and security.\nPresident Biden issued a landmark Executive Order directing federal agencies to establish new high standards for AI safety and security, protect Americans' privacy, advance equity and civil rights, stand up for workers and consumers, promote competitive markets for AI development and use, and more. Democrats are committed to ensuring that workers get a voice in how AI is used in their workplace and that they share fairly in any economic gains AI produces.\nWe know that AI can deepen discrimination, bias, and other abuses in justice, health care, education, and housing. That's why the Administration has already taken action by publishing the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and issuing new guidance from federal agencies on combating algorithmic discrimination across the economy.\nAs AI becomes more prevalent, it's critical we have the brightest minds working to understand new technologies. The Administration launched an AI Talent Surge to accelerate hiring AI professionals across the federal government, launched a pilot program to enhance successful initiatives for training additional scientists in AI, and created the AI Safety Institute at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to set rigorous standards for extensive testing of powerful AI models to ensure safety before public release.\nDuring President Biden's second term, Democrats will continue to advocate for the safe and secure development of AI. We will invest in the AI Safety Institute to create guidelines, tools, benchmarks, and best practices for evaluating dangerous capabilities and mitigating AI risk. We will also prioritize funding for critical AI research and development that advances AI safety.\nWe will also ban voice impersonations, and President Biden will take action to provide heightened protections in critical sectors such as health care, financial services, education, housing, and transportation. Finally, we will make sure that we responsibly develop, test, procure, integrate transformative AI across the federal government.\nENDING CANCER AS WE KNOW IT\nCancer has touched nearly every single American family. As we honor the enormous courage and strength of the millions of Americans facing the disease, we're working to end cancer as we know it and get patients and families the quality care and support that they deserve. The president and first lady re-launched the Cancer Moonshot in 2022 to reduce the nation's cancer death rate by at least half and improve the experience of people who are touched by cancer.\nThe Cancer Moonshot has already announced more than 95 new programs, policies, and resources, including commitments from seven leading insurance companies to reimburse for navigation services, new actions from 40 comprehensive cancer centers and community oncology practices to bring effective navigation support to underserved communities, and established insurance codes so practices, including Medicare providers, have a way to bill for patient navigation services.\nThe Administration launched the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), which is supercharging high-impact research and development to improve American health outcomes and deliver breakthroughs on cancer. President Biden is calling on the private sector to develop and test new treatments, make drugs more affordable, and share more data and knowledge that can inform the public and benefit every company's research.\nWe're supporting these initiatives by providing funds to essential programs for cancer research and health care like the National Cancer Institute (NCI), FDA, Center of Disease Control (CDC), Veterans Affairs (VA), Indian Health Service (IHS), and ARPA-H.\nTrump will set back our progress finding treatments for cancer and other diseases - he proposed cutting funding for critical scientific research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). And, he and Republicans loosened regulations to get rid of toxic chemicals that cause cancer and made it easier for chemical companies to poison our air, water, and land.\nWith a second term in office, President Biden will continue to work to prevent cancer, detect it early, deliver innovation, care for families facing cancer, and, ultimately, end cancer as we know it.\nMEETING OUR NATION'S SACRED OBLIGATION TO VETERANS AND MILITARY FAMILIES\nPresident Biden believes that our nation has no more sacred obligation than providing for our military service members when they're sent into harm's way and caring for them and their families after they come home.\nTrump called members of the military who died in war \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" He disparages the brave men and women who wear our uniform and protect our democracy and national security. And, as president, he pushed to cut funding for veterans' benefits.\nPresident Biden signed into law more than 30 bipartisan bills addressing critical issues facing veterans, service members, and families today. He signed the PACT Act – the most significant expansion of health care benefits and services for veterans in more than 30 years – which expands VA eligibility and services to veterans who were exposed to toxic substances. Thanks to the PACT Act, more than 888,000 veterans and survivors are now receiving new service-connected disability benefits, making care and benefits available to veterans battling over 300 medical conditions.\nDemocrats are also taking steps to support veterans' mental health and decrease the scourge of veteran suicides by expanding mental health screenings, increasing access to legal and financial support, and hiring more mental health professionals at the VA. President Biden took historic action to end sexual assault and domestic violence in the military by calling for the establishment of the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault and then implementing the Commission's recommendations to better protect survivors. The Administration will prioritize the effective implementation of the Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act, including by successfully operating the Offices of Special Trial Counsel within the military services branches, and the Office of the Chief Prosecutor of the U.S. Coast Guard.\nWe're also taking steps to boost access to affordable and stable housing for all veterans, who often face a high risk of homelessness, with a focus on women veterans. Last year alone, the VA helped more than 145,000 veterans and their families stay in their homes and permanently housed more than 46,000 veterans. The Administration awarded more than $1 billion in grant funding to help homeless veterans and house their families and launched a first-of-its-kind funding for legal services for veterans experiencing or at risk of homelessness to support accessing government benefits, navigating family law, ensuring access to safe housing, and assisting with debt.\nThe Veteran Scam and Fraud Evasion (VSAFE) Task Force has cracked down on scams targeting veterans, and the new National Veterans Financial Resource Center has promoted financial stability, literacy, and debt management for veterans. The VA is making it easier and faster for veterans to get their VA medical debt forgiven.\nOur commitment to our veterans and military members extends to those who care for and support them. That's why President Biden signed an Executive Order to help military spouses obtain and maintain careers in the federal government. The Department of Defense and the Department of State also took action to ensure military spouses can keep their federal jobs when their loved ones are stationed overseas. President Biden has made child care more affordable and accessible for military families, and signed an executive order providing financial support for military-connected caregivers.\nGoing forward, we will continue to implement the PACT Act; and we will strengthen VA care by fully funding inpatient and outpatient care and long-term care, and by upgrading medical facility infrastructure. We will also improve and increase access to mental health care, expand suicide prevention, and invest in opioid overdose prevention and treatment.\nDemocrats are also determined to expand women veterans' health care and access to benefits, and to continue implementing key Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault recommendations. With a second term in office and a majority in Congress, we will fulfill our promise to end veteran homelessness and support military students with disabilities.\nDemocrats will strengthen their support for military families by making child care more affordable and accessible, expanding job opportunities for spouses, and investing in a stipend for caregivers. We will also continue implementing the military spouse Executive Order and ensure the federal government is an employer of choice for military families.\nIn recognition of our nation's greatest heroes, we will expand memorial benefits to honor their years of service and lasting memories.\nChapter Nine: Strengthening American Leadership Worldwide\nWe live in a period of significant global change. The world is at an inflection point between those who argue that autocracy – rule by dictators or single leaders – is the answer to facing today's challenges and those who understand that democracy – rule by the people – is essential to moving our world forward and uplifting people everywhere. President Biden believes at this decisive moment we must demonstrate that democracy can still deliver for our people. We must rally the world to address the challenges that impact all of us, from climate change and global health to human rights, technology, food security, and inclusive economic growth.\nThe challenges of the current moment require us to revisit old assumptions and invest in new sources of American power. We have seen aggression from authoritarian powers, the destabilizing impact of a global pandemic, the growing existential danger of the climate crisis, the awesome power of emerging technologies, and the shared vulnerabilities that underlie the 21st century global economy. Most importantly, these challenges underscore how lives and livelihoods across the world are increasingly interdependent.\nFor too long, American foreign policy was conducted as if our domestic challenges were disconnected from global ones. President Biden understands that the two go hand-in-hand, and that leading abroad means being strong and resilient at home. He also knows that the United States is strongest when our partners are strong too. That's why he has met the challenges of his first term – including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the existential threat of climate change, and intense strategic competition with China – by leading coalitions of nations who share our values to stand together.\nDonald Trump made America less safe by significantly straining U.S. alliances and emboldening autocratic regimes, while weakening global democratic norms. He insulted our allies and withdrew from international agreements and organizations that were in the national security interest. Trump praises dictators, including Vladimir Putin, and attempted to weaken the NATO alliance. And, he repeatedly disrespected the brave men and women in the U.S. military.\nWhen he entered office, President Biden moved to quickly and decisively repair the damage that Trump had done to America's relationships with our allies and our reputation around the world. Trump's America first strategy meant America was alone, less secure, less prosperous, and with American leadership and values falling behind worldwide. By reinvesting in America's manufacturing base, leveling the playing field for American workers, and standing alongside our allies to support democracies and push back against autocracy, President Biden has bolstered our national security and is investing in a future where America will continue to lead on the world stage.\nEUROPE\nDuring President Biden's first term, no region of the world has better illustrated the importance of our alliances than Europe. When Vladimir Putin launched his reckless war of aggression against Ukraine, he sought to shake the very foundations of the free world. He thought he could roll into Ukraine and that Ukraine and the world would roll over. He was wrong. Instead, he met the determination of the Ukrainian people. He also enhanced the resolve of NATO, the greatest military alliance in the history of the world, led by the United States. Under President Biden's leadership, the United States has been steadfast in standing alongside our European allies to defend principles of sovereignty, deter further Russian aggression, protect our shared values, and make critical investments to ensure the security of the United States and our transatlantic allies in the years to come.\nPresident Biden has pursued three core objectives in Ukraine: help Ukraine defend its sovereignty, maintain unity in our transatlantic alliances, and prevent escalation into direct conflict with Russia. On all three fronts, the United States has succeeded. Under President Biden's leadership, America has provided Ukraine with the weapons as well as the diplomatic and economic support needed to defend its sovereignty from Russian aggression. That work has created good paying American jobs as we build the arsenal to defend ourselves at home and help protect democracy abroad. Alongside our allies, the United States has rallied a coalition of approximately 50 nations to provide much needed security assistance to Ukraine and coordinated unprecedented international actions to impose tough sanctions on Russia and hold Putin accountable on the world stage. The Biden-Harris Administration has also helped protect Ukraine's civilian population and energy infrastructure from unprovoked Russian attacks and worked to resume trade of Ukrainian agricultural products to support global food security.\nUnder President Biden's leadership, NATO is stronger and more united than ever and has bolstered its ranks by adding two highly capable allies: Sweden and Finland. NATO nations are meeting their financial commitments as well, with 23 NATO countries on track to meet a spending target of 2 percent of GDP on defense in 2024 – up from 9 countries in 2020. President Biden has also made clear that he considers the 2 percent goal to be a floor not a ceiling, and he continues to press the alliance to do even more to bolster collective defenses.\nMore broadly, the Administration has deepened cooperation with Europe to confront a range of shared challenges. President Biden has worked with our European allies to manage competition with China, resolve disputes between America and the European Union, and address long-standing conflicts in the Balkans and Caucasus and persistent trade issues across the continent. The US-EU Trade and Technology Council has established rules of the road on global economic and technology issues. The United States and United Kingdom AI Safety Institutes have agreed on a common approach to developing artificial intelligence safely. And President Biden has led the development of the US-EU Energy Council to counter the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nPresident Biden has also been willing to lead where other Presidents have not, becoming the first President to recognize the Armenian genocide.\nThe threat posed by Russia transcends its war of aggression in Ukraine. Russia is enlisting North Korea, Iran and China in its efforts to attack freedom across the world through military equipment sales and economic partnerships. By strengthening our alliances in Europe and Indo-Pacific, and strengthening the connections among our allies, including by inviting our Indo-Pacific allies to participate in the NATO Summits in Madrid, Vilnius, and Washington, DC, the United States is countering Russia's disruptive actions no matter where they occur.\nWhere President Biden has made strengthening and reassuring our allies a priority, Trump has repeatedly threatened to withdraw America from the world's most powerful military alliance and has invited Vladimir Putin to \"do whatever the hell he wants\" to any NATO country. While President Biden has always stood by Ukraine, Trump attempted to help his own political prospects by extorting President Zelenskyy – including by withholding much needed security assistance. And, now behind closed doors, Trump is supporting a policy of pushing Ukraine to surrender sovereign territory to Putin.\nPresident Biden will never turn his back on our allies. In his second term, he will continue to stand with Ukraine to stop Putin's atrocities and constrain Russia's threat to allied nations and America's vital interests. In addition to continuing to strengthen NATO, he will help Ukraine recover economically and support ongoing efforts to strengthen Ukraine's democracy and deepen its political and economic relationship with European and transatlantic institutions. President Biden will continue to work closely with the EU on emerging political and economic challenges and work with our European and Indo-Pacific allies to disrupt Russia's emerging military and economic alliances with Iran and North Korea.\nINDO-PACIFIC\nThe United States is an Indo-Pacific power. The region, stretching from our Pacific coastline to the Indian Ocean, is home to more than half of the world's people, nearly two-thirds of the world's economy, and seven of the world's largest militaries. In the years ahead, as the region drives as much as two-thirds of global economic growth, its influence will only grow – as will its importance to the United States.\nPresident Biden understands that standing up for the rules of the road in the Indo-Pacific, and standing by our allies, makes us safer. That is why he has maintained a commitment to freedom of navigation across the Indo-Pacific, standing with the Philippines and other allies and partners to push back against hostile actions and coercion by China. He also worked to expand our military presence in Japan and secure access to strategic sites in the Philippines through a new defense cooperation agreement – steps that will help deter future regional aggression.\nAcross the Indo-Pacific, President Biden has prioritized strengthening key multilateral partnerships. He elevated the Quad – which brings together the democratic strength of the United States, Australia, India, and Japan – to unleash new forms of regional cooperation on technology, climate, health, and maritime security. He founded AUKUS – a partnership among the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia – to better integrate the defense industrial bases of two of our closest allies and to produce conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines and increase cooperation on advanced capabilities such as artificial intelligence, autonomous platforms, and electronic warfare. Under President Biden's leadership, the United States hosted a historic trilateral Camp David Summit with Japan and South Korea, enshrined the Washington Declaration with South Korea, and extended trilateral deterrence discussions with Japan. The Administration has elevated our relationships with Vietnam, Indonesia, and ASEAN to Comprehensive Strategic Partnerships. It has intensified our engagement with vital regional fora in the Indo-Pacific, including hosting the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum and ASEAN nations for face-to-face summits in Washington, DC, and hosting the 2023 APEC Summit in San Francisco. President Biden is also investing in a twenty-first-century partnership between the United States and India that builds technology into the fabric of our cooperation through programs such as the U.S.-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology.\nPresident Biden has also worked alongside our allies to counter the threat posed by North Korea's destabilizing development of nuclear and missile programs, in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions. By bolstering our trilateral cooperation with South Korea and Japan, we are maintaining peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and beyond.\nTrump took a different approach in the region, embarrassing the United States on the world stage including by flattering and legitimizing Kim Jong Un, exchanging \"love letters\" with the North Korean dictator. Trump directly threatened our valued ally South Korea with the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed there over a trade dispute. President Biden has and will stand by our allies, especially South Korea, against North Korea's provocations, including its illegal build-up of missile capabilities.\nIn his second term, President Biden will continue to promote a free, open, connected, prosperous, secure, and resilient Indo-Pacific. He will deepen economic engagement to drive inclusive growth. He will champion human rights. And he will continue to strengthen our traditional alliances and broaden regional partnerships to bolster deterrence and resist coercion.\nCHINA\nPresident Biden recognizes that the People's Republic of China (PRC) is America's most consequential strategic competitor. The PRC is the only global actor that combines the intention to fundamentally reshape the U.S.-led international order with an increasing military, economic, diplomatic, and technological capacity to do so. President Biden understands the imperative of rising to this challenge while managing the competition between our countries responsibly.\nPresident Biden has invested in our strengths at home and our alliances abroad to compete vigorously with China, but we do not seek conflict. He has maintained a steadfast commitment to being tough but smart towards the PRC, relentlessly advancing U.S. interests and values while ensuring a floor of stability in the relationship with China. We will make no apology in pushing back on unfair trade practices that harm American workers. And we will guard against China taking advantage of America's openness to use U.S. technologies against America, our allies, and our interests. Against this backdrop, we seek to \"de-risk\" and diversify the economic relationship between our countries, not decouple. We will protect a targeted number of sensitive technologies with focused restrictions, creating a \"small yard and a high fence\" that preserves our national security.\nPresident Biden has taken decisive action to counter unfair economic practices by the PRC and level the playing field for American workers, strategically increasing tariffs on a variety of products such as steel and aluminum, semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries, critical minerals, solar cells, ship-to-shore cranes, and medical products.\nPresident Biden also knows that for America to succeed in future competition with China, we must continue to invest in our workers and industrial base now. That is why he issued an executive order on outbound investment, preserving and protecting American and allied national security interests by denying China access to most advanced technologies that allow them to develop their military and surveillance capacities. He also tightened restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence chips and manufacturing equipment, as well as semiconductor, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing technologies to China, stifling their military use of these technologies.\nAnd in areas where it is in the interests of the United States and the world for our two nations to work together – like addressing climate change and countering fentanyl trafficking – the United States will do so. President Biden pushed China to take action to curb the flow of fentanyl into the Americas, as well as to commit to climate change mitigation efforts as part of a global coalition.\nFor all of this tough talk on China, Trump failed to deliver results for the American people. His reckless proposal to raise tariffs by 10 percent – not just on goods from China, but across the board on any imported goods from any country in the world – will cost American families an estimated $1,500 a year. His threat of a 60 percent tariff on Chinese goods will add another $1,000 annually. Trump's temper tantrums have harmed our alliances, and if he is elected, will hurt the American people. Trump talks. President Biden delivers.\nIn his second term, President Biden will remain focused on actions at home and abroad to outcompete China. He will continue to stand up to unfair economic practices, restrict the PRC's access to advanced technologies that could be used to harm American interests, and reshore supply chains for materials and technologies critical for the 21st century.\nThe Administration will continue to invest in our alliances and partnerships to ensure China cannot coerce its neighbors or overturn the international rules that keep America secure and prosperous. President Biden will also remain steadfast in America's commitment to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait consistent with the U.S. One China policy – guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances – in order to continue to ensure that there are no unilateral changes to the status quo from either side.\nEven as we compete with China, the Administration will continue to responsibly manage the relationship with the PRC to avoid a costly spiral to conflict and seek to identify new areas where the United States and China may be able to work together, such as setting guardrails on the safe usage of artificial intelligence.\nTHE MIDDLE EAST & NORTH AFRICA\nPresident Biden is working to build a durable peace in the Middle East bolstered by regional integration, a strong coalition to counter and deter Iran and prevent it and its terrorist proxies from threatening the security of the region, and a negotiated two-state solution that ensures Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state with recognized borders and upholds the right of Palestinians to live in freedom and security in a viable state of their own. The terrorist group Hamas sought to destroy the promise of that vision on October 7, 2023, but they will not succeed. The United States strongly supports Israel in the fight against Hamas. And the hard work of diplomacy under the President's leadership has made real progress on a way forward that will free the hostages, establish a durable ceasefire, ease humanitarian suffering in Gaza, and make possible normalization between Israel and key Arab states, together with meaningful progress and a political horizon for the Palestinian people.\nPresident Biden has spent decades working to advance U.S. interests and values in the Middle East. As President, he has met with and worked alongside every key leader in the region to de-escalate conflicts, deter aggression and forge new ways to promote stability, prosperity, human security, and peace. President Biden has long believed that partners and allies should be able to deter conflict and defend themselves in ways that safeguard human rights and prevent civilian harm.\nThe Administration has worked tirelessly to deepen and widen regional integration. In September 2023, President Biden announced a new economic corridor to connect India to Europe through the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Israel. He also directed his Administration to build on the Abraham Accords and work on a historic normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, As a tangible sign of this normalization process, President Biden helped negotiate the first-ever civilian aviation agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, allowing for overflight of Israeli civilian aircraft in Saudi airspace and leading to a more integrated and economically connected Middle East.\nThrough aggressive diplomacy backed by U.S. military power, the Administration has worked alongside our allies and partners to deter and defend against Iran and its terrorist surrogates. President Biden has postured U.S. military forces in the region and authorized precision airstrikes on key Iranian-linked targets tied to attacks against U.S. troops to deter further aggression by Iran. President Biden has also continued to protect the American people from terrorism, authorizing military strikes that took out ISIS emirs and the leader of Al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri.\nIn response to brazen attacks by Iranian-linked Houthi forces against international commercial shipping, U.S. naval vessels in the Red Sea, and Israel, President Biden ordered military strikes, alongside key allies, against Houthi targets and organized Operation Prosperity Guardian, a coalition of more than 20 nations committed to defending international shipping and deterring Houthi attacks.\nWhen Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones against Israel in April 2024, President Biden led an unprecedented defensive coalition – together with partners from Europe and across the Middle East – to defeat the attack, protect Israel, and stop the spread of a wider war. Through direct defensive action by the U.S. military and its partners, Iranian munitions did not cause significant damage, demonstrating both America's ironclad commitment to the security of Israel and our unrivaled ability to leverage growing regional integration among U.S. partners to counter Iranian aggression.\nAll of this stands in sharp contrast to Trump's fecklessness and weakness in the face of Iranian aggression during his presidency. In 2018, when Iranian-backed militias repeatedly attacked the U.S. consulate in Basra, Iraq Trump's only response was to close our diplomatic facility. In June 2019, when Iran shot down a U.S. surveillance aircraft operating in international airspace above the Straits of Hormuz, Trump responded by tweet and then abruptly called off any actual retaliation, causing confusion and concern among his own national security team. In September 2019, when Iranian-backed groups threatened global energy markets by attacking Saudi oil infrastructure, Trump failed to respond against Iran or its proxies. In January 2020, when Iran, for the first and only time in its history, directly launched ballistic missiles against U.S. troops in western Iraq, Trump mocked the resulting Traumatic Brain Injuries suffered by dozens of American servicemembers as mere \"headaches\" – and again, took no action.\nThe Administration continues to manage the fallout from Trump's reckless and short-sighted decision to pull the United States out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to constrain Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions. Iran was abiding by the agreement not to expand its nuclear capacity until Trump's costly mistake. Since then, as a result, Iran has gone from being more than a year away from being able to produce enough weapons grade material for a bomb to a matter of weeks, should it choose to do so. Iran has continued to advance its nuclear program, increase the size and enrichment level of its uranium stockpile, and develop, manufacture, and operate advanced centrifuges. President Biden remains committed to a diplomatic solution while standing resolute that Iran will never be allowed to develop nuclear weapons.\nResponse to the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel and Next Steps to a Lasting Peace for Israelis and Palestinians\nPresident Biden and Vice President Harris believe a strong, secure, and democratic Israel is vital to the interests of the United States. Their commitment to Israel's security, its qualitative military edge, its right to defend itself, and the 2016 Memorandum of Understanding is ironclad. President Biden and Vice President Harris recognize the worth of every innocent life, whether Israeli or Palestinian.\nPresident Biden and Vice President Harris have unequivocally denounced Hamas's brutal attack on Israel on October 7, condemned the gruesome violence – including conflict-related sexual violence – demonstrated by Hamas and made clear that the United States wants to see Hamas defeated.\nPresident Biden traveled to Israel – the first U.S. president to do so at a time of war – in the days after October 7 to demonstrate that the United States stands with Israel in its quest for peace and security. He has also defended Israel at the U.N. against one-sided efforts to condemn Israel. The Administration worked with Congressional leaders to pass a historic aid package worth $14 billion to help Israel defend itself and to provide more than $1 billion for additional humanitarian aid to Gaza.\nPresident Biden has also been determined to broker an immediate and lasting ceasefire deal that once finalized secures the return of all hostages, including the remaining Americans held in Gaza; addresses the immense civilian pain and extreme suffering being caused by the conflict, including the displacement and death of so many innocent people in Gaza; results in a durable end to the war in Gaza; and sets the stage for a lasting regional peace. The President has made clear to the world the importance of this ceasefire and he and his team are working at the highest levels to finalize this deal.\nPresident Biden has also worked tirelessly – including through the appointment of a senior civilian coordinator for humanitarian relief – to surge and ensure the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people. Many vulnerable civilians are suffering deadly consequences of the Israel-Hamas war. Residents of Gaza have been displaced, and food insecurity has been severe. The Administration has worked relentlessly to deliver food, medicine, and other aid to the people of Gaza and to set the conditions for the reconstruction of communities in Gaza that have been devastated by the war.\nAs President Biden has made clear, a ceasefire deal will lead to a more secure Israel and unlock the possibility of greater regional integration and historic normalization with its Arab neighbors. It will allow Israelis to safely return to their homes without fear of being attacked. A deal will also allow for Arab nations and the international community to help rebuild Gaza in a manner that does not allow Hamas to re-arm. It will allow the United States to work with partners to rebuild homes, schools, and hospitals in Gaza and repair destroyed communities. It would create the conditions for a better future for the Palestinian people, one of self-determination, dignity, security, and freedom, and ultimately a state of their own – a contrast to Trump, who refuses to endorse the political aspirations of the Palestinian people.\nPresident Biden and Vice President Harris oppose any unilateral steps by either side, including annexation, that undermine prospects for two states. We will continue to stand against incitement and terror. The Administration opposes settlement expansion. President Biden has spoken out against extremist settler violence, and in February, the President issued an executive order establishing U.S. authority to impose financial sanctions against foreign persons engaged in actions that threaten the peace, security, or stability of the West Bank. The Administration believes that while Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations, it should remain the capital of Israel, an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths. We support critical assistance to the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza, consistent with U.S. law. The Administration opposes any effort to unfairly single out and delegitimize Israel, including at the United Nations or through the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement, while protecting the Constitutional right of our citizens to free speech.\nThe Lebanese people deserve to live in an independent and sovereign Lebanon that is free from the grip of Iran-backed Hezbollah, and a corruption-free, competent, reform-minded government focused on addressing the needs of its people. In this regard, the Administration is also committed to facilitating a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing hostilities along the Israel-Lebanon border that would ensure the return of both Israeli and Lebanese families to their homes.\nWESTERN HEMISPHERE\nNo region impacts the United States more directly than the Western Hemisphere. With $1.9 trillion in annual trade, shared values and democratic traditions and family bonds, our partners in Latin America and the Caribbean are key contributors to U.S. prosperity and resiliency. The President is building coalitions across the region that make America safer and more prosperous. He knows that we must work in lockstep with our neighbors to ensure democracies deliver on the issues that matter most to all of us.\nIn the last four years, President Biden has strengthened ties with key allies across the Hemisphere. He designated Colombia as a major non-NATO ally, a recognition of the close and unique relationship between the countries that will strengthen our military and economic ties. Understanding that irregular migration affects every country in the hemisphere, President Biden led the development of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, a landmark agreement that strengthens cooperation on migration among 22 countries and promotes responsibility-sharing and a more orderly and humane management of migration across the region. He and the Vice President have created over 250,000 new jobs in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala under the Administration's ambitious Root Causes strategy for Central America. President Biden also hosted the inaugural Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity Leaders' Summit to establish an enduring forum to mobilize economic investment for the region. And he has strengthened bonds with our closest neighbors, Canada and Mexico, on issues ranging from border security to trade.\nPresident Biden is committed to countering corruption, authoritarianism, democratic backsliding, and violence in the region. He has continued to lay the groundwork for progress on U.S.-Cuba relations in a manner that benefits Americans, resuming flights between the two nations, reuniting separated families, and restoring diplomatic engagement on discrete issues like migration. And his Administration has also played a critical role in supporting Haiti's stabilization efforts, becoming the largest financial sponsor to the Kenyan Multinational Security Support mission that is countering gang violence in the country and providing humanitarian aid.\nPresident Biden is also supporting human rights and fundamental freedoms as people across the region pursue a more just and prosperous future. Under President Biden, the United States negotiated the release of ten American hostages from Venezuela, reinstated sanctions on Venezuela's oil and gas sector in response to President Nicolás Maduro failing to commit to free and fair elections, and cracked down on Nicaragua for repression of their population and abuse of migrants.\nIn sharp contrast, the chaos of Trump's presidency threw our critical partnerships in the region into turmoil. He normalized autocratic leadership and failed to stand up for shared American values. In his second term, President Biden will continue the work to ensure a secure border, protect U.S. jobs, and maintain stability in neighboring countries in order to keep Americans safe and prosperous.\nAFRICA\nBy the end of the century, an estimated 40 percent of the world's population will live in Africa. President Biden has strengthened partnerships in the region and recognizes African nations' critical role in global stability and economic development. In a historic move, the Administration successfully advocated for the African Union to become a permanent member of the G20, ensuring Africa's voice in global economic discussions. And President Biden's hosting of Kenyan President Ruto for a state visit, the first by an African Head of State since 2008, underscored the importance of the U.S.-Kenya partnership, reflecting a broader strategy of strengthening bilateral ties across the continent grounded in mutual respect.\nThe Administration's work with the continent is focused on advancing democratic governance, fostering sustainable economic growth, improving health outcomes, and addressing the urgent challenges of climate change. The U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in 2022 underscored how the United States and African nations are expanding partnerships to meet shared challenges. The President is committed to continuing work that will support American and African institutions and citizens as they respond to emerging opportunities and challenges in an increasingly urban and connected world. His pledge to invest $55 billion over three years across Africa is a reflection of that commitment. Through initiatives like the African Growth and Opportunity Act and Prosper Africa, the Administration is deepening economic ties between African countries and the United States, advancing regional integration, and helping realize Africa's immense economic potential for our mutual benefit.\nPresident Biden is committed to addressing development challenges and urgent humanitarian needs across the continent. The Administration has invested and committed to provide nearly $20 billion in health programs across Africa. It has delivered over $13 billion in emergency aid and food security assistance for resilient African food systems and supply markets. President Biden has also launched a new strategic partnership on food security between the United States and the African Union that will leverage the public and private sectors, along with multilateral development banks and international financial institutions to accelerate transformational investments in sustainable and resilient food systems to prevent food shocks before they happen.\nStrengthening the capacity of African nations to address security threats, including terrorism and violent extremism, remains a top priority. The Administration is expanding support for African-led peacekeeping operations and conflict resolution initiatives, ensuring that interventions align with the aspirations of local communities. President Biden also places significant emphasis on human rights and the rule of law, leveraging diplomatic channels and development assistance to promote these values. He will continue to push for a return to democracy in cooperation with the African Union in areas experiencing violence and instability, including Sudan, where he named a Special Envoy to work towards ending the conflict. .\nTrump routinely ignored and disrespected the African continent, denigrating some nations as \"shithole countries.\" By giving up America's moral authority in the region, he damaged America's ability to collaboratively shape Africa and the world's future.\nIn his second term, President Biden will continue to build 21st century U.S.-African partnerships. He will also work to ensure that Africa has a seat at the table in major global decisions by lobbying for United States Security Council reform that will secure permanent representation for Africa.\nSTRENGTHENING THE U.S. AND GLOBAL ECONOMY\nPresident Biden's international economic policies promote growth, resilient supply chains, and clean energy adoption, while empowering American workers and workers everywhere. For too long, America's trade policies and approach to the global economy let middle-class jobs move offshore, hollowed out our supply chains, rewarded corporate CEOs instead of valuing workers, and failed to generate inclusive economic growth. In response to the previous status quo, President Biden is committed to building a fairer, more durable global economic order, for the benefit of the American people and for people everywhere.\nUnder President Biden, the United States is championing a modern industrial and innovation strategy, both domestically and with international partners. That strategy is focused on bolstering our economic and technological strengths, promoting diverse and resilient global supply chains, and setting high standards for labor, environmental practices, trusted technology, and good governance. It also aims to channel capital towards delivering public goods such as climate solutions and healthcare advancements.\nAmerica's prosperity and the prosperity of our allies and partners are mutually reinforcing. Under President Biden's leadership, companies from American allies are building cutting-edge factories in the United States, employing hundreds of thousands of Americans. U.S. partners provide critical materials, expertise, and products the world needs to achieve global climate goals, and are important markets for U.S. goods. Trade with allies and partners on fair terms promotes growth and reinforces alliances.\nWith the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, and bilateral initiatives such as the U.S.-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership, the United States will mobilize tens of billions of dollars to invest in clean energy development and critical infrastructure with high labor standards around the world. These investments will result in high-quality growth, increased supply chain resilience, and progress toward global climate goals.\nAmerican strength at home and leadership in the world depends on America remaining at the forefront of technological innovation. President Biden will work with governments, experts, and members of the private sector to ensure that artificial intelligence and other innovative technologies lead to progress without creating new national security risks and societal divisions. Building on joint technology initiatives with the European Union, India, Singapore, South Korea, and other partners, President Biden will promote innovation and shared rules for global technologies.\nTrump was the first President of the United States to leave office having fewer jobs in his Administration than when he became President. Unlike Biden, whose targeted tariffs on China will promote U.S. growth, Trump's plan to increase taxes on imports from allies, like European cancer drugs and foods from Mexico and Latin America, will fall hard on American families. Trump has consistently failed to help American workers because he has always put himself first. President Biden has and always will put American workers first.\nIn his second term, President Biden will continue to invest in America and our allies and partners to grow the middle class globally. He will pursue modern industrial policies, make strategic public investments to fill in where markets cannot, work to secure our supply chains on critical technologies, and fight for a global minimum tax that ensures corporations pay their fair share. President Biden will also continue to work with our allies and partners to protect labor and climate standards while helping America compete and win on the world stage. He will leverage economic tools and diplomatic partnerships and he will rally the world against economic coercion, utilizing mechanisms like the G7, World Bank, and other multilateral institutions.\nLEADING WITH DIPLOMACY AND AMERICAN VALUES\nPresident Biden has often said that the United States is strongest when we lead not only with the example of our power but with the power of our example. Military force should be a tool of last resort, not the first. Commitment to our values at home and abroad requires working alongside our allies and using every diplomatic tool available to advance American interests. It means investing in members of our Civil and Foreign Service, who lead America's engagement with the world and work in support of our shared prosperity and security in rapidly changing and increasingly complex environments.\nPresident Biden ended America's longest war, bringing our troops home from Afghanistan and facilitating the resettlement of over 120,000 Afghan partners and their families in the United States, the largest resettlement effort since the Vietnam War. And in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the United States rallied the world to address a global food crisis and provided $2 billion in global humanitarian assistance.\nPresident Biden's leadership globally was clear in his response to the COVID-19 pandemic among other global health challenges. Between May 2021 and February 2024 the United States donated more than 693 million vaccine doses to 117 countries and economies. And the Administration led the largest-ever replenishment of the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria, with donors pledging $15.7 billion.\nUnderstanding that there is nothing more important than addressing the climate crisis, President Biden has kept his word and ensured that the United States leads the world to combat climate change. The record-breaking heat, floods, storms, drought, and wildfires devastating communities around the world underscore the grave risks we already face and the urgency needed to reduce emissions and to help the most vulnerable countries cope with devastating climate impacts. The United States rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement on day one of his presidency, and President Biden set an ambitious goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, in line with climate science. And the Administration is supporting investments in climate infrastructure that make tangible progress on climate mitigation and adaptation while also helping developing countries unlock economic growth in key areas.\nIn response to the rise of authoritarianism across the globe, President Biden convened two Summits for Democracy, bringing allies and partners together to strengthen democratic resilience, combat corruption, and promote human rights globally, including for LGBTQI+ persons. The third Summit occurred this year under South Korea's leadership, and President Biden is proud to have catalyzed this new global forum to support and coordinate democracies around the world, and which will continue in his second term.\nPresident Biden believes the United States must continue to be a strong advocate for the rights and opportunities of women and girls around the world. Under his leadership, the United States issued its first-ever National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality, which recognizes that elevating the status of women and girls is not just the right thing to do – it is a strategic imperative that advances American interests in prosperity and stability. When women and girls are healthy, educated, and able to participate economically, their families and communities prosper, poverty decreases, and economies grow. And when women participate in conflict resolution and post-conflict processes, it improves the likelihood of securing sustainable peace.\nPresident Biden will continue to support the United States Strategy and National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security and will continue to work to end the epidemic of gender-based violence around the world, including efforts to increase accountability for conflict-related sexual violence. His Administration will continue prioritizing ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. President Biden understands that advancing the rights of women and girls includes sexual and reproductive health and rights. His Administration has prioritized women's health by rescinding the global gag rule (Mexico City Policy), and supporting funding for the UN Population Fund.\nTrump's undermining of democratic institutions, attacks on the free press, and refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election weakened the global perception of American democracy, giving autocracies a pretext to dismiss democratic values and practices. These actions collectively eroded the United States' standing on the world stage.\nPresident Biden will never turn our back on our alliances or fail to stand up for human rights and democracy around the world and at home. In his second term, he will support the critical work of our diplomats and continue to fight to bring Americans detained abroad home. President Biden will continue work to strengthen global health systems, bolster pandemic preparedness programs, and alleviate global food insecurity. He will expand on America's track record of providing humanitarian assistance to those most in need including by resettling 100,000 refugees in 2024, the most in three decades after Trump nearly destroyed the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. President Biden will also ensure the United States continues to drive multilateral efforts to reduce poverty, address unsustainable debt burdens and build a more inclusive and more fair global economy. He will continue to lead on efforts to combat the existential threat of climate change and support adaptation efforts in developing nations. And he will keep fighting corruption, supporting good governance, and countering terrorist threats around the world.\nSTRONGEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD\nThe United States has the finest fighting force in the history of the world. And while our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, Coast Guardsmen and guardians remain the envy of the globe, President Biden understands that maintaining our military advantages in the future means making strategic investments now. That is why the Administration has invested in cutting-edge capabilities across all services and domains and maintained a commitment to modernize and recapitalize the nuclear triad as the bedrock of deterrence. That is also why President Biden has made historic investments in America's military industrial base, putting billions of dollars to work in America to increase production capacity of critical munitions and other capabilities to support U.S. and allied forces in combat zones such as Ukraine. And as the Administration does the work to plan against dramatic changes in geopolitics, technology, economics, and the environment, our military has maintained its ability to address terrorist threats, evidenced by successful strikes against leaders of al-Qa'ida and ISIS.\nProperly investing in our military also means first and foremost investing in those who are the bedrock of it: our service members. President Biden has secured pay raises for military personnel in recognition of their invaluable service. His Administration has allocated over $10 billion to enhance health care services for veterans and active-duty personnel, including expanded mental health resources and programs to support those suffering from PTSD and other service-related conditions. President Biden's consistent efforts to address military housing issues resulted in a $1.4 billion investment in military housing improvements, leading to better living conditions and increased oversight of housing contracts. The Administration's policies have also supported military spouses, with over $200 million in funds dedicated to bolstering education and employment opportunities, underscoring the critical role that families play in the strength and resilience of the armed forces.\nAware of exacerbated nuclear proliferation challenges that the world is facing as Russia, the PRC and North Korea expand and diversify their nuclear arsenals, and in the context of Iran continuing to enrich uranium at dangerous levels, the Administration is showing what it means to act responsibly as a nuclear power. Nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. The United States is developing and fielding only what is required to deter while signaling openness to future arms control negotiations if competitors are interested. The Administration is modernizing each leg of our nuclear triad, updating our command, control, and communication systems, and investing in our nuclear enterprise – to ensure that we can sustain and enhance if necessary capabilities and posture. President Biden has reaffirmed in U.S. doctrine that U.S. nuclear weapons are reserved for deterring strategic attack by those that threaten us and our allies and partners with nuclear weapons.\nTrump has never understood the values that our military swears to uphold. Instead, he calls our service members \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" He can never make America great, because he does not understand the values represented by our military that already make us great.\nPresident Biden has never and will never turn his back on our military. In his second term, he will continue to invest in upgrading to next-generation weapon systems, cutting-edge training opportunities, and deterrence capabilities such as our submarine force and the nuclear triad. He will continue to address cyber threats by bolstering the capacity of our intelligence communities and leading the development of rules of the road for technologies like artificial intelligence. And he will continue to always put our veterans and military families first by securing additional pay raises for service members, accessible and affordable childcare for our military families, good-paying job opportunities for military spouses, effective suicide and sexual assault prevention programs, and benefits for our veterans and their families.\nRelated PDFs\nAPP Note: In the official Platform as distributed, the words \"to state\" were merged as \"tostate.\" For purposes of this document we have made a correction.\nKEYWORDS: \"2024 Democratic Party Platform;\" \"Democratic Platform 2024\"\nDemocratic Party Platforms, 2024 Democratic Party Platform Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/373813\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        California Indian History\nSHORT OVERVIEW\nOF\nCALIFORNIA INDIAN HISTORY\nREGIONAL LIFEWAYS\nOne manner in which we can seek to understand aboriginal California Indian cultures is to look at the tribes inhabiting similar climatic and ecological zones. What emerges from this approach is a remarkable similarity in material aspects of the many different tribes inhabiting those territories. Generally speaking technologies and materials used to manufacture tools, homes and storage containers show great similarity. Hunting, trapping and fishing technologies also are shared across tribal lines terrain, available water plants and animals affected the density of populations, settlement patterns as each tribe adjusted to its environment.\nNORTHWEST\nThis area would include the Tolowa, Shasta, Karok, Yurok Hupa Whilikut, Chilula, Chimarike and Wiyot tribes. The distinctive northern rainforest environment encouraged these tribes to establish their villages along the many rivers, lagoons and coastal bays that dotted their landscape. While this territory was crisscrossed with thousands of trails, the most efficient form of transportation was the dugout canoe used to travel up and down rivers and cross the wider and deeper ones such as the Klamath. These tribes used the great coast Redwood trees for the manufacture of their boats and houses. Redwoods were cleverly felled by burning at the base and then split with elkhorn wedges. Redwood and sometimes cedar planks were used to construct rectangular gabled homes. Baskets in a variety of designs were manufactured in with the twined technique only. Many of these arts survived into the twentieth century and traditional skills have enjoyed a great renaissance in the past twenty years.\nThe elaborate ritual life of these tribes featured a World Renewal ceremony held each Fall in the largest villages. Sponsored by the wealthiest men in the communities, the ceremony’s purpose was to prevent future natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, floods or failure of acorn crop or a poor salmon run. Supplication to supernatural spirits. Because such disasters directly threaten the community, great attention to detail and the utmost solemnity accompanied such ceremonies. This and other traditional rituals continue to be practiced, despite the grinding poverty that plagues many of these groups.\nThese tribes were governed by the most wealthy and powerful lineage leaders. The great emphasis on wealth found in these cultures is reflected in the emphasis on private ownership of food resources such as oak groves and fishing areas.\nNORTHEAST\nThis region included the Modoc, Achumawi, and Atsugewi tribes. The western portion of this territory was rich in acorn and Salmon. Further to the East, the climate changes from mountainous to a high desert type of topography. Here food resources were grass seeds, tuber berries along with rabbit and deer.\nThese Indians found tule to be a useful source of both food (the rootbulb is consumed) and a convenient material when laced together to form floor mats and structure covering. Volcanic mountains in the Western portion of their territory supplied the valuable trade commodity obsidian. The Social-political organization of these peoples was independent but connected to their neighbors by marriage ties. Following contact, the Achumawi and Atsuguewi suffered a tremendous population decline due to vigilante violence and respiratory diseases. The Modocs spectacular 1872 resistance to removal to the Oregon territory was the last heroic military defense of native sovereignty in 19th century California Indian History.\nSome surviving Northeast tribesmen received public land allotments around the turn of the century. The XL Rancheria was established for some of these Indians in 1938. Tragically the surviving Modocs were exiled to either Oregon or Oklahoma.\nCENTRAL CALIFORNIA\nThis vast territory includes: Bear River, Mattale, Lassick, Nogatl, Wintun, Yana, Yahi, Maidu, Wintun, Sinkyone, Wailaki, Kato, Yuki, Pomo, Lake Miwok, Wappo, Coast Miwok, Interior Miwok, Wappo, Coast Miwok, Interior Miwok, Monache, Yokuts, Costanoan, Esselen, Salinan and Tubatulabal tribes.\nVast differences exist between the coastal peoples, nearby mountain range territories, from those living in the vast central valleys and on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada. Nevertheless, all of these tribes enjoyed an abundance of acorn and salmon that could be readily obtained in the waterways north of Monterey Bay. Deer, elk, antelope and rabbit were available elsewhere in vast quantities.\nIn this region basketry reached the height of greatest variety. Perhaps the Pomo basket makers created the most elaborate versions of this art. Both coiled and twine type baskets were produced throughout the region. Fortunately, basket making survived the years of suppression of native arts and culture to once again become one of the most important culturally defining element for Indians in this region.\nCommon in this area was the semi-subterranean roundhouse where elaborate Kuksu dances were held in the past and continue to this day. These rituals assure the renewal of the world’s natural foods both plant and animal. Despite differences, between tribes, these rituals share similar purposes.\nLike everywhere else, in California, villages were fiercely independent and governed internally. The abundant food supply allowed for the establishment of villages of up to 1000 individuals, including craft specialists who produced specific objects and goods for a living. In smaller communities, each family produced all that was necessary for survival.\nSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA\nSouthern California presents a varied and somewhat unique region of the state. Beginning in the north, tribes found in this area are the Chumash, Alliklik, Kitanemuk, Serrano, Gabrielino Luiseno Cahuilla, and the Kumeyaay. The landmass and climate varied considerably from the windswept offshore Channel Islands that were principally inhabited by Chumash speaking peoples. Communication with their mainland neighbors was by large and graceful planked canoes powered by double paddle ores. These vessels were called “Tomols” and manufactured by a secretive guild of craftsmen. They could carry hundreds of pounds of trade goods and up to a dozen passengers. Like their northern neighbors, the Tactic speaking peoples of San Nicholas and Santa Catalina Islands built planked canoes and actively traded rich marine resources with mainland villages and tribes. Shoreline communities enjoyed the rich animal and faunal life of ocean, bays and wetlands environments. Interior tribes like the Serrano, Luiseno, Cahuilla, and Kumeyaay shared an environment rich in Sonoran life zone featuring vast quantities of rabbit, deer and an abundance of acorn, seeds and native grasses. At the higher elevations Desert Bighorn sheep were hunted.\nVillages varied in size from poor desert communities with villages of as little as 100 people to the teaming Chumash villages with over a thousand inhabitants. Conical homes of arroweed, tule or croton were common, while whale bone structures could be found on the coast and nearby Channel Islands. Interior groups manufactured clay storage vessels sometimes decorated with paint. Baskets were everywhere manufactured with unique designs. Catalina Island possessed a soapstone or steatite quarry. This unique stone was soft and could easily be carved with cutting tools and shaped into vessels, pipes and cooking slabs.\nEach tribe and community had a chieftain, sometimes females, whose duty it was to organize community events and settle conflicts among their followers. This leader was usually assisted by a crier or assistant, Shaman or Indian doctors were known everywhere and greatly respected. The ritual use of the hallucinogen jimsonweed (Datura meteloides) was primarily in male puberty rituals. Like other California Indian communities, society was divided into three classes, the elite, a middle class and finally a less successful lower class. These robust peoples were among the first to encounter the strangers who would change their world forever.\nHISTORY\nThe Spanish entrada into Alta California was the last great expansions of Spain’s vastly over extended empire in North America. Massive Indian revolts among the Pueblo Indians of the Rio Grande in the late 17th century provided the Franciscan padres with an argument to establish missions relatively free from colonial settlers. Thus, California and its Spanish Colonization would be different from earlier efforts to simultaneously introduce missionaries and colonists in their world conquest schemes. Organized by the driven Franciscan administrator Junipero Serra and military authorities under Gaspar de Portola, they journeyed to San Diego in 1769 to establish the first of 21 coastal missions.\nDespite romantic portraits of California missions, they were essentially coercive religious, labor camps organized primarily to benefit the colonizers. The overall plan was to first militarily intimidate the local Indians with armed Spanish soldiers who always accompanied the Franciscans in their missionary efforts. At the same time, the newcomers introduced domestic stock animals that gobbled up native foods and undermined the free or “gentile” tribe’s efforts to remain economically independent. A well-established pattern of bribes, intimidation and the expected onslaught of European diseases insured experienced missionaries that eventually desperate parents of sick and dying children and many elders would prompt frightened Indian families to seek assistance from the newcomers who seemed to be immune to the horrible diseases that overwhelmed Indians. The missions were authorized by the crown to “convert” the Indians in a ten-year period. Thereafter they were supposed to surrender their control over the mission’s livestock, fields, orchards and building to the Indians. But the padres never achieved this goal and the lands and wealth was stolen from the Indians.\nEpidemic diseases proved to be the most significant factor in colonial efforts to overcome native resistance. Soon after the arrival of Spanish colonists, new diseases appeared among the tribes in close proximity Spanish missions. Scientific study of demographic trends during this period indicate the Indians of the America’s did not possess any natural immunities to introduced European diseases. Maladies such as smallpox, syphilis, diphtheria and even children’s’ ailments such as chickenpox and measles caused untold suffering and death among Indians near the Spanish centers of population. Even before the outbreak of epidemics, a general population decline was recorded that can be attributed to the unhygienic environment of colonial population centers. A series of murderous epidemic diseases swept over the terrified mission Indian populations. Beginning in 1777 a voracious epidemic likely associated with a water born bacterial infection devastated Santa Clara Valley Costanoan children. Again, children were the primary victims of a second epidemic of pneumonia and diphtheria expended from Monterey to Los Angeles was recorded in 1802. By far the worst of these terrifying epidemics began in 1806 and killed thousands of Indian children and adults. It has been identified as measles and attacked Indian populations from San Francisco to the central coast settlement of Santa Barbara. Sadly, the missionary practice of forcibly separating Indian children from their parents and incarcerating children from the age of six in filthy and disease-ridden gender barracks most likely increased the suffering and death of above mentioned epidemics. Excessive manual labor demands of the missionaries and poor nutrition probably contributed to the Indians inability to resist such infections. Less easily measured damage to mission Indian tribes occurred as they vainly struggled to understand the biological tragedy that was overwhelming them. Faith in their traditional shaman suffered when native efforts were ineffective in stemming the tide of misery, suffering and death that life in the missions resulted in. With monotonous regularity, missionaries and other colonial officials reported upon the massive death and poor health of their Indian laborers. Pioneering demographer Sherburne F. Cook conducted exhaustive studies and concluded that perhaps as much as 60% of the population decline of mission Indians was due to introduced diseases.\nNATIVE RESISTANCE\nThe unrelenting labor demands, forced separation of children from their parents and un-ending physical coercion that characterized the life of Indians under padre’s authority resulted in several well documented forms of Indian resistance. Within the missions, the so-called “converts” continued to surreptitiously worship their old deities as well as conduct native dances and rituals in secret. By far the most frequent form of mission Indian resistance was fugativism. While thousands of the 81,586 baptized Indians temporarily fled their missions, more than one out of 24 successfully escaped the plantation like mission labor camps. Many Mission Indians viewed the padres as powerful witches who could only be neutralized by assassination. Consequently, several assassinations occurred. At Mission San Miguel in the year of 1801 three padres were poisoned, one of whom died as a result. Four years later another San Miguel Yokut male attempted to stone a padre to death. In 1804 a San Diego padre was poisoned by his personal cook. Costanoan Indians at Mission Santa Cruz, in 1812, killed a padre for introducing a new instrument of torture which he unwisely announced he planned to use on some luckless neophytes awaiting a beating. Few contemporaries Americans know of the widespread armed revolts precipitated by Mission Indians against colonial authorities. The Kumeyaay of San Diego launched two serious military assaults against the missionaries and their military escorts within five weeks of their arrival in 1769. Desperate to stop an ugly pattern of sexual assaults, the Kumeyaay utterly destroyed Mission San Diego and killed the local padre in 1775. Quechan and Mohave Indians along the Colorado River to the east destroyed two missions, killed four missionaries and numerous other colonists in a spectacular uprising in 1781. This last rebellion permanently denied the only overland route into Alta California from Northern New Spain (Mexico) to Spanish authorities. Military efforts to reopen the road and punish the Indians were met with utter failure. The last great mission Indian revolt occurred in 1824 when disenchanted Chumash Indians violently overthrew mission control at Santa Barbara, Santa Ynez and La Purisima. Santa Barbara was sacked and abandoned while Santa Ynez Chumash torched 3/4 of the buildings before fleeing. Defiant Chumash at La Purisima in fact seized that mission and fought a pitched battle with colonial troops while a significant number of other Chumash escaped deep into the interior of the Southern San Joaquin Valley. After 1810 a growing number of guerrilla bands evolved in the interior when fugitive mission Indians allied with interior tribes and villages. Mounted on horses and using modern weapons, they began raiding mission livestock and fighting colonial military forces.\nThe impact of the mission system on the many coastal tribes was devastating. Missionaries required tribes to abandon their aboriginal territories and live in filthy, disease ridden and crowded labor camps. Massive herds on introduced stock animals and new seed crops soon crowded out aboriginal game animals and native plants. Feral hogs ate tons of raw acorns, depriving even the non-missionized tribes in the interior of a significant amount of aboriginal protein. Murderous waves of epidemic diseases swept over the terrified Mission Indian tribes resulting in massive suffering and death for thousands of native men, women and children. The short life expectancy of mission Indians prompted missionaries to vigorously pursue runaways and coerce interior tribes into supplying more and more laborers for the padres. Missionary activities therefore thoroughly disrupted not only coastal tribes, but their demand for healthy laborers seriously impacted adjacent interior tribes. Finally, by 1836 the Mexican Republic forcibly stripped the padres of the power to coerce labor from the Indians and the mission rapidly collapsed. About 100,000 or nearly a third of the aboriginal population of California died as a direct consequence of the missions of California.\nDespite the devastating population decline suffered by tribes in whose territories missions had been established, many managed to maintain tribal cohesion. After 1800, most mission populations were a hodgepodge of different tribes speaking a multiplicity of languages. Because many Indians refused to learn or feigned ignorance of the Spanish language, missionaries appointed labor overseers from each tribe to direct work crews. Such practical policies kept tribesmen from losing culturally distinct identity. Further evidence of cultural persistence was the practice of tribes maintaining separate housing in multi-tribal Indian villages built next to the missions. Finally, many former mission Indians continued to speak their native languages and provide researchers with detailed ethnographic and linguistic data well into the 20th century.\nINDIANS AND THE MEXICAN REPUBLIC\nIn 1823 the Spanish Flag was replaced by that of the Mexican Republic. Little immediate change in personal or Indian policy occurred. However, the independence government was decidedly anti-clerical and the growing body of colonial leaders deeply resented the monopoly of Indian lands and the unpaid Indian labor enjoyed by the Franciscans. While no land grants to the colonists had occurred under Spanish rule, some 25 grazing permits or concessions had been issued to colonial citizens. This was the beginning of the dispossession of tribal lands by colonial authorities. The vast plantation like missions claimed about 1/6 of the present territory of the state. But legal title to these lands were assigned to the Spanish crown. The missions were only supposed to last 10 years, after which the developed estates were to be distributed to surviving mission Indians. It was assumed that the Indians would evolve into hardworking, tax paying citizens of Mexico. But the missionaries kept coming up with excuses why they should not surrender the rich pastoral and agrarian empire they had erected with the lands, resources and hard labor of mission Indians. The Mexican Republic’s 1824 constitution declared Indians to be citizens with rights to both vote and hold public office. Despite this liberal declaration, Indians throughout the republic continued to be treated as slaves.\nCOLLAPSE OF THE MISSION SYSTEM\nIn actual practice, the new government gave 51 land grants to its colonial citizens between 1824 and 1834. These lands actually belonged to various tribes then incarcerated in nearby missions. These actions just increased the lust for more Indian lands by a growing body of colonial ranchers. There followed a growing chorus of demands that the missionaries surrender their monopoly on Indian labor and “free” the Indians. The sincerity those sentiments should be seriously doubted. The power of this class prevailed and between 1834-36 the government revoked the power of the Franciscans to extract labor from the Indians and inaugurated a plan to distribute mission lands. Venal public officials in charge of the distribution granted the most valuable lands to themselves and their relatives. The secularization processes, it was called, was so restrictive that few ex-mission Indians were eligible for the distributed lands. More significant still, the majority of surviving mission Indians were not native to the areas of coastal missions. Most neophytes at this time had been forced to relocate from their tribal domains and promptly returned to them following their liberation.\nMany of these returned exiles were faced with difficult tasks of reconstructing their decimated communities in the wake of crippling population declines. Furthermore, their tribal lands had become transformed by the introduction of vast herds of horses, cattle, sheep, goats and hogs that destroyed the native flora, the primary source of native diet. Wild game animals were likewise driven off by these new animals. What developed from this new condition was the emergence of guerrilla Indian bands made-up of former fugitive mission Indians and interior tribesmen from villages devastated by official and unofficial Mexican paramilitary attacks and slave hunting raids. Eventually a significant number of these interior groups joined together to form new conglomerate tribes. These innovative and resilient tribes quickly converted the anti-mission activities of their members into systematic efforts to re-assert their sovereignty by widespread and highly organized campaigns against Mexican ranchers and government authority in general.\nVastly overestimating their power, Mexican authorities authorized an additional 762 land grants by 1847. In reality, the effectiveness of Indian stock raiders increased dramatically when American and Canadian fur trappers provided a lucrative market for purloined horses by the mid 1830’s. Interior Mexican ranches were increasingly abandoned in the face of economic ruin by native stock raiding activities. Even Johann A. Sutter was reduced to begging the Mexican government to buy his fort following a mauling at the hands of Miwok Indians near the Calaveras in June of 1846.\nDespite these successes, a series of murderous epidemics in the twilight years of the Mexican era severely reduced the interior population. For instance, in 1833 an American party of fur trappers introduced a murderous scourge of malaria into the Sacramento and San Joaquin River drainages. While traversing the epicenter of the plague, J. J. Warner reported,\n“From the head of the Sacramento to the great bend and slough of the San Joaquin we did not see more than six or eight live Indians; while large numbers of their skulls and dead bodies were seen under almost every shade tree near the water, where the uninhabited and deserted villages had been converted into graveyards.”\nIn this tragedy, more than 20,000 Central Valley Miwok, Yokuts, Wintun, and Maidu Indians perished. A new outbreak of small pox devastated Coast Miwok, Pomo, Wappo, and Wintun tribes. Approximately 2000 died in this 1837 epidemic originating from Fort Ross. By 1840 these and other murderous maladies had so thoroughly saturated the Indian population of Mexican California that diseases became endemic.\nMexican forced labor and violence at the hands of the militia and paramilitary slave hunting parties account for a significant amount of the population decline suffered by California Indians. On the eve of the American take-over the aboriginal population of approximately 310,000 had been reduced to about 150,000. This gut wrenching 50% decline had occurred in just 77 years. The implications for survivors is largely a mute tale of suffering and grieving over the loss of a stunning number of children, parents and elders. What came next was worse still.\nTHE AMERICAN INVASION\nAlta California the poorly managed and badly neglected stepchild of Mexico was rapidly overwhelmed by a combination of aggressive Indian raids and the arrival of United States Army, Navy and Marine forces in the summer of 1846. Despite a seemingly irrational murderous attack on Sacramento River Maidu Indian villages by U.S. Army forces under the command of John C. Fremont, the majority of California Indians involved in that struggle aided the Americans as scouts, warrior-soldiers and wranglers.\nWhen Mexican resistance collapsed in January of 1847, thereafter Indian Affairs was administered by a succession of military governors. Stock raiding Indians in the interior recommenced their depredations when they learned Indian slavers such as Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo and Johann A. Sutter had been appointed as Indian sub-agents. Military government’s policy was to suppress stock raiding and furthermore imposed draconian restrictions on the free movement of Indians and required Indians to carry certificates of employment.\nTHE GOLD RUSH\nThe discovery of gold in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada at a sawmill construction site developed by Indian Agent Johann Sutter, ushered in one of the darkest episodes of dispossession widespread sexual assault and mass murder against the native people of California. Sutter immediately negotiated a treaty with the chief of the Coloma Nisenan Tribe which would have given a three-year lease to lands surrounding the gold discovery site. During those negotiations, the chief prophetically warned Sutter that the yellow metal he so eagerly sought was, “very bad medicine. It belonged to a demon who devoured all who searched for it”. Eventually the military governor refused to endorse Sutter’s self-serving actions.\nWithin a year a hoard of 100,000 adventurers from all over the world descended upon the native peoples of California with catastrophic results. The entire state was scoured by gold seekers. Thinly spread government officials were overwhelmed by this unprecedented deluge of immigrants and all effective authority collapsed. Military authorities could not prevent widespread desertion of soldiers and chaos reigned.\nA virtual reign of terror enveloped tribesmen the mining districts. Wanton killings and violence against Indians resisting miners developed into a deadly pattern. An Oustemah Nisenan female named Betsy later recalled,\n“A life of ease and peace was interrupted when I was a little girl by the arrival of the whitemen. Each day the population increased and the Indians feared the invaders and great consternation prevailed …. as gold excitement advanced, we were moved again and again, each time in haste. Indian children…. when taken into town would blacken their faces with dirt so the newcomers would not steal them….”\nNumerous vigilante type paramilitary troops were established whose principal occupation seems to have been to kill Indians and kidnap their children. Groups such as the Humboldt Home Guard, the Eel River Minutemen and the Placer Blades among others terrorized local Indians and caused the premier 19th century historian Hubert Howe Bancroft to describe them as follows.\n“The California valley cannot grace her annals with a single Indian war bordering on respectability. It can, however, boast a hundred or two of as brutal butchering, on the part of our honest miners and brave pioneers, as any area of equal extent in our republic……”\nThe handiwork of these well-armed death squads combined with the widespread random killing of Indians by individual miners resulted in the death of 100,000 Indians in the first two years of the gold rush. A staggering loss of two thirds of the population. Nothing in American Indian history is even remotely comparable to this massive orgy of theft and mass murder. Stunned survivors now perhaps numbering fewer than 70,000 teetered near the brink of total annihilation.\nThe newcomers sometimes met organized Indian resistance. In 1850 a Cupeno chief named Antonio Garra Sr. organized local Southern California Indians to resist an illegal tax imposed upon San Diego Indians by the county sheriff. Sporadic attacks upon both Americans and some Mexicans by Garra’s followers resulted in a massive crackdown on Indian communities. Soon a rival Cahuilla chief captured Garra and turned him over to the authorities who promptly hung him and several of his followers. In 1851 several mountain Miwok tribes offered armed resistance to the hoard of miners overrunning their territory. When one tribe destroyed a trading-post owned by an American who kept at least 12 Indian “wives” a paramilitary militia was formed and aggressively attacked Indians throughout the southern mines area. Eventually this group calling itself the “Mariposa Battalion” breached the unknown granite fortress of the valley of Yosemite. A ruthless campaign against the Yosemite Indians resulted in the capture of their Chief Teneya and a temporary exile to the San Joaquin River “Indian Farm”.\nIn reality, these Indian campaigns were motivated by rapacious greed of the miners to gain Indian lands and provide political capital for ambitious office seekers. Sadly, both the state and federal government eventually reimbursed the vast majority of these paramilitary forays for expenses incurred. This is indeed a dreary story of subsidized murder on a scale unequaled in all of this country’s Indian wars.\nTREATY MAKING AND TREATY REJECTION\nIn 1849 Washington sent two special emissaries to California to report on the nature of Mexico’s recognition of Indian land titles in California. Neither spoke to a single Indian and eventually produced an ambiguous and inaccurate report to the great disadvantage of the Indians. Upon this misinformation, and in an attempt to stem the unprecedented chaos and mass murder of the gold miner’s confrontation with the California Indians, Congress authorized three federal officials to make treaties with the California Indians. Their purpose was to extinguish Indian land titles and provide the Indians with territories that would be protected from encroachment by non-Indians. They were given just $25,000 to accomplish this monumental task. Soon after their arrival in San Francisco in January of 1851, the enormous size of territory prompted the commissioners to split up and negotiate treaties on their own. The reports and correspondence of the treaty commissioners clearly demonstrate that the suspicious and reluctant Indians who could be persuaded to attend the treaty meetings were only vaguely aware of its purpose. This can be attributed to the frequent problems of translators who often had to translate several Indian dialects into Spanish and again into English. Few if any of the Indians could understand English. The random manner in which the commissioners organized the meetings resulted in the majority of tribes not participating. Despite these crippling drawbacks, the treaty process proceeded until January 5th of 1852. In all, eighteen treaties were negotiated. The treaties agreed to set aside certain tracts of land for the signatory tribes. They additionally promised the assistance of farmers, school teachers, blacksmiths, stock animals, seeds and agricultural equipment, cloth and much more. In return, the signatory tribes promised to forever quitclaim to the United States their lands. Just what specific lands being surrendered were not specified. Anthropologists in the 20th century could only identify 67 tribes, 45 village names and 14 alternative spellings of tribal names. Eighteen groups were unidentifiable. Despite the obvious fact that not all California Indian tribes had been consulted or contacted they too would be bound by the negotiations. Nevertheless, the federal government promised to reserve 7,466,000 acres of land to the dispossessed Indians,\nAn immediate outcry from an enraged public followed the completion of the commissioner’s task. It was revealed that the commissioners had overspent their budget by a half a million dollars in the incredibly inflated economy of gold rush California. Local newspapers orchestrated an abusive campaign and local politicians echoed the fears of their compassionate electorate that the treaty reserves might contain something valuable, like gold. Most Americans simply wanted the Indians removed to some other territory or state. California’s newly elected state senators provided the final blow. On July 8, 1852, the Senate in executive session refused to ratify the treaties. They were filed with an injunction of secrecy that was finally removed in 1905!\nMeanwhile, Congress had created a commission to validate land tittles in California. The commission was required by law to both inform the Indians that it would be necessary to file claims for their lands and report upon the nature of these claims. Because no one bothered to inform the Indians of these requirements, no claims were submitted. Through this neat trick, the federal government “legally” avoided the normally lengthy and duplicitous negotiations over land sessions.\nThe practical result was the complete dispossession of the Indians in the eyes of the government. Despite this chicanery, several tribes would violently and later legally contest these frauds to defend their territory, homes and families.\nFrom the native viewpoint, signatories of the treaties had agreed to move to specific locations promised in the treaties. Yet such attempts often met with violent attacks by miners and others opposed to the very existence of Indians. Non-treaty groups simply endured the madness and race hatred of those waging a merciless war against them. Most tribes did their best to withdraw from all contact with the mayhem overwhelming them.\nA HARSH STATE GOVERNMENT\nThe formation of the state government proved to be an official instrument of the oppressive mentality of the miner’s militia. In Governor McDougall first address to the legislature he promised, “a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct….…” Despite guarantees in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Indians were denied state citizenship, voting rights and more important still, the right to testify in court. These acts effectively removed all legal redress for native peoples and left them to the mercy of anyone who chose to sexual assault, kidnap even murder them. Despite entering the union as a free state in 1850, the California legislature rapidly enacted a series of laws legalizing Indian slavery. One of the laws sanctioned an indenture system similar to Mexican peonage in widespread practice throughout California prior to 1850. All levels of state, county and local governments participated in this ugly practice that evolved into a heartless policy of killing Indian parents and kidnapping and indenturing the victim’s children. Indian youth could be enslaved by the cruel act to the age of 30 for males and 25 for females. This barbarous law was finally repealed four years after President Lincoln’s emancipation proclamation in 1863.\nThe federal government finally decided to establish an Indian policy in California in 1854 when Edward F. Beale was appointed Superintendent of Indian Affairs for California. Beale quickly established a prototype Indian preserve within the boundaries of the Army’s military reserve in the Southern San Joaquin Valley, called Fort Tejon. The site was chosen because of the continuing problem of local horse raiding by Southern California Indians. Yokut, Gabrielino and Kitanemuk tribesmen were gathered together on this barren 50,000-acre parcel call San Sebastian. Beale’s instruction from Washington authorized him to establish four additional reserves with a $250,000 budget. Apparently, Beale squandered his entire allocation on less than 200 Indians at San Sebastian. This action becomes comprehensible only when it is known that within a decade, Beale wound up owning much of that short-lived reserve. His behavior in office set the standard for decades of widespread corruption and incompetence that distinguishes the Bureau of Indian Affairs in California and elsewhere. Following Beale’s removal from office in 1856, Col. T.J. Henely established Indian Reserves on the Klamath River, Nome Lackee near Colusa, Nome Cult (Round Valley) and the Mendocino Reserve at the mouth of the Noyo River on the coast. The latter two were both located in Mendocino County.\nThese hastily organized communities provided little in the way of support or even minimal refuge for native peoples cajoled to move there. These unsurveyed reserves lacked game, suitable agricultural lands and water. They soon became overrun with white squatters who systematically corrupted the Indians and introduced an epidemic of venereal diseases. More unsatisfactory still, were Indian Farms located on lands rented from newcomers now holding legal title to said lands. The Fresno and Kings River Indian Farms were established in the south-eastern San Joaquin Valley along the rivers of the same name. Federal records clearly show these farms provided only a handful of Indians homes, the majority completely lacked cultivation, but they did provide paychecks for the superintendent’s friends and political cronies. The majority of these early reserves and Indian Farms were abandoned in the 1860’s due to the state’s Indian slavery codes that allowed all able-bodied males, females and even children to be indentured to white citizens. A great many reservation residents could not participate in the agricultural and ranching programs because their labor “belonged” to private state citizens. Frequently, federal and Indian agents themselves indentured his wards for personal enrichment. Government records for this period show that fewer than 3000 of the less than 70,000 surviving California Indians received recognition let alone provisions for reservations. South of the Tehachapi Mountains California Indians remained totally ignored by Washington. So what were the vast majority of Indians doing during this period?\nLATE 19TH CENTURY ADAPTATION AND RESISTANCE\nThe vast majority of California Indians struggled to survive without government aid or recognition. Many on the verge of actual starvation dispersed throughout their territories and sought to support themselves through agriculture and ranch labor for the new “owners” of California. This was a traditional pattern of behavior when drought and other natural catastrophes struck. Deprived of land and their life sustaining resources, they were left with no other options. With a few notable exceptions, the mass murder of the Gold Rush era diminished, as Indian victims became scarce and survivors learned to avoid Americans whenever possible. The great hardships of this adaptation were made bearable with the development of a messianic cult movement called the Ghost Dance of 1870. In part triggered by the introduction of Christian missionary activities, this new religious movement was pan-tribal in nature and obviously a response to the massive population decline. The movement promised the return of dead relatives and the disappearance of the oppressors. It was most desperately embraced by those tribes who had most recently suffered great population declines. Despite lasting only a few years, it was fundamental in revitalizing intra-tribal religious integration. In short, it provided hope for the nearly hopeless situation Indian found themselves confronted with.\nThe last organized violent reaction to dispossession and federal Indian policy erupted between 1860-1872. The first was a series of Indian wars in Northwestern California. Here Yurok, Karok, Hupa and other tribes fought the increasingly paranoid and aggressive Americans who routinely murdered them, stole their children and burned their villages. Jack Norton, a Hupa historian characterized the situation as a “deranged frontier”. Attempts to disarm Indians and continued kidnapping for sexual slavery quickly led to violent resistance. In 1858, the militia established a fort in the Hupa Valley to make war on the Wilkut and Chilula tribes. Many members of those tribes had been captured and deported to the Mendocino Reservation. Frustrated by the stiff resistance of interior groups, the militia found it easier to murder nearby inoffensive peaceful and non-hostile Indians. The notorious Indian Island massacre in Humboldt Bay was the bitter fruit of that race hatred. Eventually some Hupa Indians agreed to assist the soldiers in hunting their hostile neighbors. Despite this defection, several bands of Hupa joined the hostiles and effectively resisted until 1864 when they surrendered. This led to the establishment of the Hupa Valley Reservation in August of 1864.\nBecause both state and federal authorities seriously underestimated the number of surviving California Indians, plans to remove all Indians to the handful of reservations already established, proved impractical. Several attempts to place multiple tribes on single reservations frequently resulted in violence, mass murder and war. The Modoc war of 1872 was caused by such a policy that insisted the Modocs be deported out of California to the Klamath Reservation in Oregon. Driven twice from that reserve, a third attempt to deport the Modocs back to Klamath resulted in a stunning war in 1872. The Indian service removed the Konkow Indians of Chico and the Atsugewi of Shasta County to the Round Valley Reservation in 1862. Squatters overrunning the Reservation descended upon these unfortunate tribesmen and murdered 45 of them. The mob justified its actions by claiming the Indians might steal food from the squatters. Survivors fled in terror back to Chico, only to be again removed to Round Valley sometime afterwards. The BIA showed little interest in assisting such tribes. Those lucky enough to have reservations established in the aboriginal territories were understandably reluctant to share the scant advantages they enjoyed with newly arrived emigre tribes. Also true was the fact that no tribes desired to be relocated outside of their aboriginal territories. After all, each tribe’s creation story emphasized the sacred nature of its own particular landscape. Tradition emphasized territorially and to stray from it required one to steal food resources from neighboring tribes. Non-Indians could not fathom the intensity and depth of the Indians spiritual attachment to their territories.\nA steady population decline accompanied by widespread reports of destitution and hunger haunted those tribes without reserved lands. Despite hardship encountered, survival demanded innovation and adaptation. Being driven to the edge of extinction, Indians demonstrated again and again a strong will to survive. That determination notwithstanding, the widespread kidnapping, slavery and violence took a frightful toll on tribesmen and their cultures. Leadership lineages became scattered and displaced. Many ceremonies could no longer be held because access to sacred places was now denied. Cultural mandates to feed ceremonial guests could no longer be achieved by those who otherwise were able to hold public rituals. Finally, Christian missionaries gained control at many reservations under President Grant’s Peace Policy of 1869. These folks were determined to destroy Indian culture and aboriginal belief systems that undergirded it.\nThe California superintendency attracted a succession of special investigators caused by constant reports of corruption that reached Washington. Special reports conducted in 1858, 1867 and 1883 clearly and thoroughly document the corruption and inefficiency plaguing government programs for Indians. President Grant’s Peace Policy of 1869 inaugurated an era of acculturation under duress. Policy makers in the government declared the only path of salvation for surviving Indians would be Christianization, along with the adaptation of private ownership of’ property. Once these twin goals were realized, Indians would be rewarded with citizenship and take their place among the lower classes with other non-whites in American society. Reservation agents insisted their residents join churches and cease practicing the old ways. The General Allotment Act of 1887 forcibly divided reservation tribal lands, doling out small parcels to individual Indians and their families. If the allotee built a house, engaged in farming or ranching, sent his children to government Indian schools and renounced his tribal allegiance and otherwise pleased the agent, he would (after 25 years) receive title to his land and citizenship. Unlike tribal lands, these parcels would become taxable. The program was inaugurated in California in 1893. By 1930 approximately 2,300 allotments had been carved out of the tiny communal tribal reservation lands. Traditional Indians opposed the detribalizing goals of allotment. The uneven and unequal distribution of allotments was used by Indian agents to keep tribal populations divided and politically impotent. Nevertheless, considerable tribal resistance and pan-tribal organizing developed in opposition to allotment. The program ground to a halt in 1930 due to Indian opposition and failure of BIA to complete the necessary paperwork. The law was repealed in 1934. Thousands of acres of California Indian lands and millions of acres nationally were lost to this destructive and ill-conceived policy.\nPAN-INDIAN GROUPS, LANDLESS INDIANS AND RANCHERIAS\nSeveral hundred individual land allotments were distributed to California Indians from public lands found principally in northern California. Often times these were isolated havens from hostile neighbors. Many were assigned to clusters of individuals who were related by kinship and are likely core tribal members who otherwise hand no lands. The tribal communities often held traditional ceremonies and participated in those of their more fortunate reservation Indians.\nSouthern California Indians were finally provided with recognition when several parcels of their former tribal domains were set aside by executive order beginning in 1873 with the establishment of the Tule River Indian Reservation. Fourteen Southern California Indian Reservations were set aside by executive orders beginning in 1891 and amended in 1898. Unfortunately, Indians in both Orange and Los Angeles counties were excluded from land distributions due in part to the value of coastal real estate. Nevertheless, small tribes from this area participated in pan-Indian organizations.\nReduced to severe destitution the majority of Indians struggled to support their families as landless laborers. Only 6,536 Indians were recognized and living on reservations about the turn of the century. Every Indian who survived to see the dawn of the 20th century had witnessed great suffering and the irreplaceable loss of numerous grandparents, mothers, fathers and children. Some lineages disappeared altogether. The nadir had been reached. Demographer S.F, Cook determined the California Indian population declined to fewer than 16,000 individuals in 1900. This figure represents a gut wrenching descent from over 300,000 into a vortex of massive death in just 131 years of colonization! These staggering losses prompted non-Indians of good will to assist Indian tribes in efforts to secure lands for the still numerous landless Indians.\nSeveral Indian reform groups blossomed before and after the turn of the century. One of their earliest successes was a long legal effort to prevent the Cupa Indians from being dispossessed of their ancestral village of Warner’s Hot Springs. While losing the legal case Cupa Indians and their allies managed to secure lands on the nearby Pala Indian Reservation in San Diego County. More important for the majority of landless Indians were the efforts of the Northern California Indian Association that goaded the BIA into enumerating landless Indians in 1905. The result of the survey and political pressure from Indians and their friends resulted in federal actions creating 36 new reservations and Rancherias in 16 Northern California counties. Rancherias were very small parcels of land aimed at provided homesites only for small bands of landless Indians. They are all located in Northern California. Unfortunately, the BIA’s investigator failed to visit 12 other counties, thus ignoring the luckless Indians in those areas. Between 1933 and 1941 Congress authorized the enlargement of several Southern California reservations by 6492 acres. No rancherias or homesites were made available for landless Southern California Indians.\nImportant developments occurred as a result of political activism on the part of both tribes and pan-Indian organizations from 1921 to the present. Beginning with the early efforts of the Indian Board of Cooperation, numerous California Indians self-help organizations and tribes pushed for a lawsuit over the failure of the United States to compensate the Indians of California for the loss of their aboriginal lands. Congress relented and passed the Jurisdictional Act of 1928. This legislation allowed the Indians to sue the federal government and use the state Attorney general’s office to represent them. Lacking control of their legal representative a controversial settlement was finally achieved in 1944. $17,053,941.98 was offered for the failure of the government to deliver the 18 reservations promised in treaty negotiations of 1851-2. Incredibly, the government decided to deduct all of its “costs” of providing reservations, supplies and even the salaries of corrupt and do-nothing Indians agents native peoples had endured for nearly a century. After an-other long battle, little more than 5 million dollars were finally distributed on a per-capita basis to 36,095 California Indians in 1951. A paltry $150. was distributed to surviving Indians. This parsimonious and unfair settlement prompted California Indians to seek further legal redress.\nThe efforts of California Indians to sue the federal government under the Jurisdictional Act of 1928 resulted in the creation of the federal Indian Claims Commission in 1946. This federal body allowed Indian groups to press for compensation to tribes over the theft of their lands in the 19th century. By August of 1951, twenty-three separate petitions had been filed by attorneys on behalf of tribes in California. After 20 years of tortuous maneuvering all separate claims were consolidated into a single case. A compromise settlement of $29,100,000 was offered for 64,425,000 acres of acres of tribal territory. After deduction of attorney’s fees ($12,609,000) and the addition of interest and about half a million left over from the first settlement the payment worked out to an offer of 47 cents per acre! The purchase of public domain lands in California in 1850 was never less than $1.50 per acre. This outrageous offer offended many Indians who had pinned their hopes on a settlement that would provide seed money for desperately needed economic development. Despite bitter opposition by many of the original claimants, the federal government prepared a census of eligible Indians in preparation for an anticipated judgment. The BIA organized a series of meetings to convince the litigants to accept the settlement. Eventually a majority of the groups agreed, except the Pit River tribe. They offered strong, vociferous and persistent opposition. However, through questionable balloting, the government declared they had accepted the offer in 1964. Nearly 65,000 California Indians were deemed eligible to share in the settlement. Payments of little more than $600 per person was distributed in 1968. What is of great significance here is the fact that the entire claims activities were conducted outside of normal court proceedings protected by the constitution. Thus, Indians are the only class of citizens in the United States who are denied constitutional protection of their lands by extra-constitutional means.\nTERMINATION\nDuring the divisive and controversial land claims battle the BIA began to submit plans to end all services to California Indians and transfer all authority over federal Indian reservations to the State. This new policy, called Termination, was put into motion in 1951. Special agents were sent to prepare for the end of federal jurisdiction over tribal lands. At first the state was enthusiastic over the prospect of increasing its tax base with the anticipation of the privatization of federal trust properties. Termination became law in California under authority of the Rancheria Act of 1958. This statute allowed tribes to vote on a plan to divide communal tribal property into parcels to be distributed to its members. Distributees would receive title to their lands and be free to sell it and be obliged to pay property tax from that time forward. The BIA targeted the smallest, least organized and most isolated tribes to persuade them to accept this plan for cultural and tribal suicide. Government personnel promised acceptance would result in freedom and economic independence. They further made elaborate promises to upgrade squalid housing, pave roads, build bridges, construct water projects and even provide college scholarships in return for a vote to terminate. Between 1958 and 1970 twenty-three rancherias and reservations were terminated. Chronically high unemployment rates, low educational achievement and sometimes emergency medical needs soon forced many to make loans on, or sell their lands. Worse still, many BIA services like health, education were abruptly ended for all Indians in the state. Like the earlier allotment policy, the implementation of termination set in motion a series of events that ultimately divested small tribes of 10,037 acres of land, disrupted tribal institutions and traditions and ultimately left these tribes more desperate, and impoverished than ever. Termination failed miserably to improve the socioeconomic or political power of the California Indians.\nThe occupation of Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay, by nearly 100 American Indian College students in the fall of 1969 ushered in a new era of Indian affairs. A new generation of young, energetic and highly educated California Indians emerged during this period. Highly skeptical of the government they were committed to protecting tribal sovereignty. More important still, they found great value in tribal traditions. They encouraged traditional ceremonies, language retention and sought to remove impediments to the exercise of tribal religious practices. These developments paralleled a new generation of tribal leaders who would dynamically defend tribal rights. These activities made three things apparent; many California Indians were still landless, terminated tribes had been swindled, and some tribes had never been recognized by the federal government. However, reservation, landless and unrecognized tribesmen all shared lives of desperate poverty and little hope for employment or economic development.\nIn recognition of the growing sophistication of California Indians, the state legislature created the, Native American Heritage Commission in 1978. This all Indian commission works as a liaison between state, federal and tribal governments. It has been successful in protecting Indian burials, sacred places and providing access to government lands to harvest native plants for ceremonial practices and basketmaking.\nTo date 17 rancherias and reservations have reversed the disastrous termination process. Other tribes are currently pursuing legal avenues to reverse their termination status. Unrecognized tribes have vigorously pursued acknowledgment processes whose requirements are so impossibly demanding that many large tribes in Arizona and New Mexico could not today meet such standards of cultural continuity. Nevertheless, the Acagchemem of San Juan Capistrano the Muwekma of the San Francisco Bay area, and the Coast Miwok of Marin County are close to federal recognition and acquiring a trust land base.\nGovernment developed economic development plans have a history of nearly a century of total failure. Currently more than thirty reservations and rancherias have established gaming businesses on their lands. Some are highly successful while other are not. Some public opposition to these activities seems to center around the fear that Indians may be cheated by their business partners. Such fears smack of paternalism and ignore the reality that few if any valuable resources can be found on Indian lands. Few private investors have come forward to work with Indian tribes outside of the gaming industry. With few choices, wise reservation leadership view gaming as an interim step toward greater economic independence. The Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians are the best example of how that dream can be achieved.\nThe amazing adaptive capabilities of California Indians has demonstrated the resiliency and genius of these much misunderstood and hardworking tribes can achieve under the most unfavorable of circumstances. We know, and our friends and counter parts in local and national governmental agencies must understand that only through the exercise of our tribal sovereignty can we successfully take our rightful place in our prosperous and free nation. We enter the next century filled with optimism.\nProfessor Edward D.

Last month, the caucus urged the president to take executive action on immigration by extending deportation relief to certain groups of unauthorized immigrants, such as parents of U.S.-born children. Some immigrant advocates have dubbed Obama the “deporter in chief” over the fact that his administration has deported about as many immigrants in five years as the George W. Bush administration deported in eight years.\nDuring his speech, Obama is expected to reiterate his pledge to make changes to immigration policy on his own, something he said he will do after the November midterm elections.\nThe record number of deportations comes even as 580,946 young unauthorized immigrants have received relief from deportation and work permits since 2012 under a policy called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.\nIn Pew Research Center surveys, Hispanics have expressed disapproval of the growing number of deportations during the Obama administration. Six-in-ten Hispanic adults in February said the increased number of deportations of unauthorized immigrants is a “bad thing,” while the U.S. general public was divided on the issue. And while 89% of Hispanics in 2013 said they support a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants who meet certain requirements, a majority (55%) said deportation relief is more important than a pathway to citizenship for this population.\nMost of the growth in the number of deported immigrants has come from those deported for reasons other than a criminal conviction. In 2013, 240,000 deported immigrants did not have a previous criminal conviction, up from 218,000 in 2012. Meanwhile, the number of deportations of those with a criminal conviction has stalled at around 200,000 for the past two fiscal years.\nOne distinct feature of the record number of deportations is the increasing share of deportations by U.S. Customs and Border Protection after border apprehension. In 2013, 25% of all deportations were carried out by the agency, up from 17% in 2012. Meanwhile, the number of deportations carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which deports people caught both at the border and the interior of the country, fell in 2013 compared with 2012.\nAnother change is that in 2013, a record 363,000 (83%) of deportations were carried out without appearing before a judge – either through an order issued by an enforcement agent (called expedited removal) or by using a previous order of deportation (called reinstatement of final orders). This is due to a 2005 shift in policy that has increased the likelihood of being deported after apprehension.\nThis rise in the number of deportations also coincides with stalled growth of the U.S. unauthorized immigrant population since 2009, and a more recent rise in the number of apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. In 2013, there were 414,000 apprehensions at the southwest border, a rise of 27% over 2011 (the most recent low in apprehensions).\nAlso, a new shift in migration patterns emerged over the last two years: more Central American immigrants and unaccompanied children crossing the border. These trends have led to an increase in apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. On the other hand, the number of Mexican immigrants apprehended at the border and the interior has continued to decline from a high of 1.1 million in 2005 to 425,000 in 2013.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        FACT SHEET: Growing Middle Class Paychecks and Helping Working Families Get Ahead By Expanding Overtime Pay\nWe’re making more workers eligible for the overtime that you’ve earned. And it’s one of the single most important steps we can take to help grow middle-class wages.President Barack Obama, La Crosse, WI, July 2, 2015\nEvery week, millions of Americans work more than 40 hours a week but do not receive the overtime pay they have earned. Tomorrow, the Department of Labor will be finalizing a rule to fix that by updating overtime protections for workers. In total, the new rule is expected to extend overtime protections to 4.2 million more Americans who are not currently eligible under federal law, and it is expected to boost wages for workers by $12 billion over the next 10 years.\nFor much of the 20th century, the 40-hour workweek was a pillar of economic security for working families. The rules of the road were simple: if you were called on to put in extra work, your employer had to pay you extra regardless of whether you received an hourly wage or a salary. This left most Americans with more money in their pockets, more time to balance obligations at home and at work, and the opportunity to get ahead with more time outside of work for school or additional training.\nYet over the past 40 years, overtime protections eroded as a result of inflation and lobbyists’ efforts to weaken them. The share of full-time workers qualifying for overtime based on their salaries has plummeted from 62 percent in 1975 to 7 percent today—even though the protections are more important than ever. Parents now have more demands on their time, with all parents working in more than six out of ten households with children. And despite a recent acceleration in wage growth and businesses adding 14.6 million jobs over a record 74 straight months of job growth, most Americans have seen relatively stagnant wages for the past few decades.\nThat’s why tomorrow, the Department of Labor is finalizing a rule to update overtime protections so they can help millions more Americans. The final rule, which takes effect on December 1, 2016, doubles the salary threshold—from $23,660 to $47,476 per year—under which most salaried workers are guaranteed overtime (hourly workers are generally guaranteed overtime pay regardless of their earnings level). Additionally, this new level will be automatically updated every three years to ensure that workers continue to earn the pay they deserve.\nIncreasing overtime protections is another step in the President’s effort to grow and strengthen the middle class by raising Americans’ wages. This extra income will not only mean a better life for American families impacted by overtime protections, but will boost our economy across the board as these families spend their hard-earned wages.\nRESTORING OVERTIME PROTECTIONS\nIn March 2014, President Obama signed a memorandum directing the Department of Labor to modernize our nation’s overtime rules, which have been comprehensively updated only once since the 1970s.\nOvertime protections were first put into place by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, and established the general standard that workers be paid time-and-a-half for any hours worked over 40 hours in a week. In general, all hourly employees are guaranteed overtime, and salaried employees are presumed to have the same guarantee unless they both: (1) make more than a salary threshold set by the Department of Labor, and (2) pass a test demonstrating that they primarily perform executive, administrative, or professional duties. A limited number of occupations are not eligible for overtime pay (including teachers, doctors, and lawyers) or are subject to special provisions.\nTomorrow’s rule takes into account input from 270,000 public comments and extensive outreach meetings with employers, business associations, small businesses, workers, worker advocates, non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and state and local government representatives. It will:\n-\nRaise the salary threshold from $23,660 to $47,476 a year, or from $455 to $913 a week. This doubles the current salary threshold while being responsive to public comments regarding regional variations in income by setting the salary threshold at the 40th percentile of full-time salaried workers in the lowest income Census region (currently the South). Tying the salary threshold to the lowest-wage region of the country has strong historical precedent in previous rulemakings.\n-\nRaise Americans’ wages by an estimated $12 billion over the next 10 years, with an average increase of $1.2 billion annually. At the same time, employers retain considerable flexibility in how they comply with the new rule, such as increasing salaries to at least the new threshold to keep positions that are primarily executive, administrative, or professional exempt from overtime pay; paying overtime for hours worked in excess of 40 in a week; or reducing overtime hours.\n-\nExtend overtime protections to 4.2 million additional workers who are not currently eligible for overtime under federal law. Others who may already be eligible for overtime will also benefit as the higher salary threshold will serve as a useful bright line test for workers—and their employers—to understand whether they are eligible for overtime. The number of workers in each state who will benefit from the rule can be found HERE.\n-\nUpdate the salary threshold every three years. The updates will ensure the threshold is maintained at the 40th percentile of full-time salaried workers in the lowest income region of the country. Based on projections of wage growth, the threshold is expected to rise to more than $51,000 with the first update on January 1, 2020.\n-\nRaise the “highly compensated employee” threshold – from $100,000 to $134,004 – above which only a minimal showing is needed to demonstrate an employee is not eligible for overtime. This upper threshold was designed to ease the burden on employers in identifying overtime eligible employees since it is more likely that workers earning above this high salary level perform the types of job duties that would exempt them from overtime requirements.\n- Respond to employers’ concerns by making no changes to the “duties test” and allowing bonuses and incentive payments to count toward up to 10 percent of the new salary level. Workers earning more than the salary threshold are still subject to the duties test to determine eligibility for overtime. In their comments to the proposed rule, employers argued that changing the duties test would be difficult and costly to implement, and the final rule leaves the existing duties test in place. Additionally, for the first time, employers will be able to count bonuses and commissions toward as much as 10 percent of the salary threshold.\nThe Department of Labor will also release three technical guidance documents, designed to help private employers, non-profit employers, and institutions of higher education come into compliance with the new rule.\n###\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        FACT CHECK: Setting the Record Straight on Bidenomics\nThis week, the White House circulated a slide deck to Hill Democrats riddled with inaccuracies, false statements, and misleading information about Biden’s record on the economy. Let’s set the record straight.\nBIDEN CLAIM: “President Biden and Congressional Democrats’ plan to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out, not the top down, is delivering for the American people. President Biden and Congressional Democrats have worked together to grow the economy and create a record number of jobs.” The President says that his Administration has: “Created more than 13 million jobs; brought the unemployment rate below 4 percent four years before experts projected and kept it there for the longest period in more than 50 years; and achieved record low unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanics, people with disabilities – and the lowest unemployment rate in 70 years for women.”\nFACT CHECK: Recovery Versus Creation\n- Nearly 72 percent of all job gains since 2021 were simply jobs that were being recovered from the pandemic, not new job creation. In fact, when looking at today’s economy compared to pre-pandemic levels, employment is up only by 3.7 million, not 13 million.\n- On the other hand, in his first 2.5 years, job creation under President Trump was 5 million—1.3 million more jobs than the current President in the same time frame after factoring in the recovery from pandemic.\nBIDEN CLAIM: “(President Biden) proved that a strong recovery and support for households brings more people into the workforce: a higher share of working age Americans are in the workforce now than at any time in more than 20 years and higher than on any day of the prior Administration.”\nFACT CHECK: Labor force participation was stronger under President Trump.\n- The labor force participation rate remains 0.7 percentage points lower under Biden than it was when President Trump was in office.\n- When adjusting for population gains, nearly 2 million more Americans are on the sidelines today than they were during the previous Administration.\nBIDEN CLAIM: Under President Biden, American families are “better off than before the pandemic: Americans have more net worth and higher inflation-adjusted disposable incomes and a lower uninsured rate.”\nFACT CHECK: Wages are NOT keeping up with Biden’s inflation crisis.\n- Real wages are down over 5 percent since President Biden entered the Oval Office.\n- Since President Biden took office, the average worker has lost over $4,900 in real wages.\nBIDEN CLAIM: The White House is “working to bring down the cost of living, including by lowering drug prices. Inflation has come down 11 months in a row.”\nFACT CHECK: Inflation is still high and causing economic pain.\n- Americans are still feeling the sting of this inflation crisis—prices are up 15.5 percent under Biden.\n- Inflation remains over three times higher than just a couple years ago.\n- The average family of four is paying $13,717 per year or $1,143 per month more to purchase the same goods and services as in January 2021.\nBIDEN CLAIM: “President Biden and Congressional Democrats are delivering historic Investments in America that are creating good jobs around the country and revitalizing our communities.” The President “put policies in place that have contributed to more than $470 billion in private sector investment commitments.”\nFACT CHECK: The “historic investments” made by Democrats don’t help the middle class.\n- The “Inflation Reduction Act” enacted by Democrats last year gave $271 billion in tax credits to pay for “green” energy projects that even liberals admit are a boon for the top 1 percent.\n- These out of control “green” handouts are going to cost American communities an estimated $1.2 trillion, according to independent analysis by Goldman Sachs, nearly $1 trillion higher than original estimates.\n- Companies with over $1 billion in sales receive more than 90 percent of special interest green energy tax subsidies.\n- Some analysts estimate that banks and insurers alone receive over half of green energy checks, far more than any other industry or sector.\nBIDEN CLAIM: Democrats are “supporting investments that have resulted in 800,000 manufacturing jobs, nearly doubling manufacturing construction, and more resilient US supply chains.”\n- 49.7 percent of the tax will be borne by the manufacturing industry, according to analysis by the non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation.\n- The Tax Foundation estimates this new tax will cost 20,000 jobs and slow investment and economic growth.\n- Workers in Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, and Kentucky would endure the largest economic hit from the new tax, according to the Heritage Foundation.\nBIDEN CLAIM: Biden set “out to rebuild American infrastructure, so that we no longer rank 13th in the world but instead have world-class infrastructure.” The President enacted “the largest investment in combatting the climate crisis in U.S. history,” paving the way for hundreds of thousands” of good-paying jobs.\n- China—Batteries\n- Today, China controls over 50 percent of the processing capacity of key EV battery inputs like lithium, cobalt, and graphite.\n- China’s influence over the EV supply chain widens to around 90 percent in manufacturing and processing in a number of battery materials and minerals.\n- According to a report from the liberal think tank SAFE, 60 to 100 percent of all battery minerals are processed in China.\n- China—Solar\n- According to the U.S. Department of Energy, China controls nearly 80 percent of the entire solar production supply chain, including 97 percent of solar wafers capacity, 81 percent of solar cell capacity, and 77 percent of global capacity for finished solar modules or panels.\n- China—Wind\n- After the IRA passed, global wind turbine orders reached record levels, 90 percent higher year-over-year in Q4 2022, with 65 percent of those orders attributable to China.\n- Despite buses and rails accounting for only a tiny fraction of Americans’ travel, mass transit and Amtrak receive the same amount of funding as highways.\n- The bill includes over $15 billion in woke climate funding initiatives that will simply healp wealthy Americans buy more electric vehicles.\nBIDEN CLAIM: “President Biden has signed legislation to reduce the deficit by more than $1 trillion” and is “committed to ensuring the wealthiest Americans and largest corporations pay their fair share and lowering prescription drug costs by cutting wasteful giveaways to Big Pharma.”\n- In 2021, keeping spending at the levels projected in January 2020 or February 2021 would have resulted in the 2021 deficit being $2.0 or $1.1 trillion lower, respectively.\n- In 2022, the deficit would have been between $400 billion and $1.2 trillion lower given had spending remained at the levels projected in any of the three prior CBO baselines.\n- Notably, had spending in 2022 been what CBO projected it would be when Biden took office – without the impact of his failed economic policies – the budget deficit would have been its lowest since 2001, which was the last time the government ran a surplus.\n- Had spending stayed at any of the previously projected levels for both years, combined deficits would have been between $1.5 and $3.2 trillion lower than the actual deficits incurred.\nGovernment spending is the primary driver of deficits and President Biden and Congressional Democrats have engaged in an unprecedented $11 trillion partisan spending spree, including:\n- $709 billion on student loan waivers and giveaways that forces the 87 percent of Americans without student loans to pay for the loans of the 13 percent who do.\n- An $80 billion slush fund for the IRS to hire 87,000 new agents.\n- Roughly $100 billion bailout of union multiemployer pension plans that overpromised and underdelivered for their workers, ultimately offloading the costs onto the American taxpayers.\nBIDEN CLAIM: “In contrast, House Republicans want to: Enact massive tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and largest corporations – adding trillions of dollars to the deficit in order to deliver a $175,000 average annual tax cut to the top 0.1 percent (incomes over $4 million).”\nThe Heritage Foundation explains:\n- “Tax cuts as a percentage of taxes paid in 2017 were largest for the lowest-income Americans and smallest for the top 1 percent, measured by adjusted gross income (AGI).\n- “Similarly, the percentage decrease in effective tax rates was about 5 percent for the highest-income group, and 16 percent

By this metric, the income tax system was made more progressive.

GDI – which measures the economy through things like income, profits, and taxes rather than production — has decreased in each of the past two months.\n- Gross Domestic Output (GDO), which is the average of GDP and GDI, and was once described by the Obama Council of Economic Advisers as being “a better gauge…of GDP growth than either GDP or GDI individually” has also experienced negative growth in 4 of the last 5 quarters.\n- According to a recent report by Heritage, “the latest economic data show the economy might be doing a ‘double dip,’ where a recession is followed by a brief period of growth and then another recession.”\n- President Biden’s policies are projected to cause the slowest economic growth in almost a century.\nBIDEN CLAIM: “Family economic security is stronger than pre-pandemic.”\n- Household net worth is 4.7 percent lower than when President Biden took office when adjusting for inflation.\n- Credit card debt, adjusted for inflation is 14.6 percent higher than when President Biden took office.\n- The monthly mortgage payment on an average home has doubled during Biden’s presidency, increasing from $1,300 to $2,600.\nBIDEN CLAIM: “Gas prices are down from their summer 2022 peak.”\nFACT CHECK: Gas and energy prices remain significantly higher than when President Biden took office.\n- Gas prices are over 34 percent higher than when President Biden took office.\n- Energy prices are up 28.5 percent from when President Biden took office.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Gov. David Dewhurst into more live appearances with Cruz, the former Texas solicitor general.\nDewhurst, supporters of Cruz say in their promotional materials, is ducking those events.\nThe lieutenant governor slipped in another door on his way to an interview with The Texas Tribune’s Evan Smith in front of a live audience of about 200 people. Dewhurst is the front-runner in the race to succeed U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. Cruz, former Mayor Tom Leppert of Dallas and Glenn Addison, an undertaker, are also after the Republican nomination — all trying to wiggle into the spotlight with Dewhurst, who was first elected to statewide office in 1998.\nCruz and his supporters are clamoring for Dewhurst to appear at debates and forums, small and large. Any room with a microphone and a gathering of Republicans, independents, Tea Partiers or reporters will do. Cruz wants the contrast to be made, and he wants the sorts of conflicts that draw the sort of news coverage that could make him known to voters. He, unlike Dewhurst and Leppert, has never faced the voters, and most voters have never heard of him.\nFor Dewhurst, appearing with Cruz offers a dubious opportunity to elevate the stature of someone who is trailing in the polls and to go toe to toe with a trained and dangerous legal advocate. For Cruz, who has argued several cases before the United States Supreme Court, a political debate is an easy layup.\nDewhurst said Thursday morning that he has already agreed to “at least one” debate. But he has been content so far, with one or two exceptions, to campaign on his own, raise money on his own and to make his pitch to voters on TV, where he started running his first ads last week.\nHe’s ignoring the opposition, driving some of them buggy. Cruz has been getting lots of support from insider Republican circles, including in Washington and New York and other spots outside of Texas. He has received a boost from bloggers and conservative activists. But to win in Texas, he has to raise enough money to get his message in front of hundreds of thousands of voters he’ll never meet.\nThe finance people have to believe in him, and they have to bet against a lieutenant governor and a former big-city mayor, both of whom have thrown millions in personal money into their races.\nThis works at other spots on the food chain, too. Addison has made relatively small purchases of radio time to run spots attacking Cruz, who he says isn’t the real conservative in the race. It’s his version of the six-foot duck, an effort to horn his way into a contest in which the other contestants won’t acknowledge his existence.\nLeppert gives a nod to his opponents in his own TV ads — he says he’s neither a lawyer nor a career politician — but he doesn’t name them. His campaign is focused on jobs and on his experience as a businessman and a mayor. Addison’s commercials are all about Cruz. Cruz’s videos on the Internet — he’s not yet running commercials on radio or TV — are all about Dewhurst.\nWhat’s Dewhurst doing? Running against Barack Obama, against Congress, against national health care and against federal spending.\nAsked directly about the luminaries blessing Cruz as the true conservative in the race — people like George Will, David Barton, Sen. Jim DeMint, James Dobson and organizations like the Club for Growth and FreedomWorks — Dewhurst made a rare reference to Cruz, though not by name: “Some of my opponents may concentrate on Washington,” he said. “They’ve lived in Washington. They want to go back to Washington. I want to represent Texas.\n“I’m not conservative enough, some say. They don’t know me. When they get to know me, they’ll know I am,” said he added, and then he launched back into his record in office and his swipes at Obama. No more about the opposition.\nYou’d think he was running against the president, which is not a bad idea in a state where the only thing more unpopular than Obama is Congress. Dewhurst isn’t talking about his opponents. He’s not talking with them, or joining them in debates and forums, though he’s willing to talk about the possibility.\nHe’s ignoring that duck, and hoping voters will, too.\nTexas Tribune donors or members may be quoted or mentioned in our stories, or may be the subject of them.

A Republican, he served in the position since 2003. In that capacity, he also served as President of the Texas State Senate. Dewhurst previously served as Texas Land Commissioner, which is considered a stepping-stone for higher office. He was the first Republican elected to the position since Reconstruction.[1]\nDewhurst unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate in 2012. A month after losing the primary runoff to Ted Cruz, Dewhurst stated that he planned to run for a fourth term as lieutenant governor in 2014.[2] Dewhurst failed to secure the Republican nomination for re-election as lieutenant governor, losing in a runoff to Dan Patrick.\nBiography\nDewhurst earned his bachelor's degree and played basketball at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\nHe was previously an officer in the U.S. Air Force, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the U.S. State Department. In 1981, Dewhurst founded Falcon Seaboard, a Texas-based diversified energy and investments company. He breeds registered Black Angus cattle, is an active team roper, and rides cutting horses in American Quarter Horse Association and National Quarter Horse Association competitions.[3]\nEducation\n- B.A., University of Arizona\nPolitical career\nLieutenant Governor (2003-2015)\nDewhurst was elected Lieutenant Governor in November 2002, when he defeated former Democratic Comptroller John Sharp of Victoria. He succeeded Bill Ratliff. Ratliff did not contest the lieutenant governor's position in the primary, opting instead for re-election to his state senate seat. Dewhurst polled 2,341,875 votes (51.77 percent) to Sharp's 2,082,281 (46.03 percent). (Two minor candidates polled the remaining 2.19 percent.) In that campaign, Dewhurst stressed his interest in public education and opposition to school vouchers.\nDewhurst was easily renominated for Lieutenant Governor of Texas in the Republican primary held on March 7, 2006. He defeated Tom Kelly, the same unknown candidate whom he bested for the nomination in 2002. Dewhurst then overwhelmed Democrat Maria Luisa Alvarado, a veterans issues research analyst and the winner of her April 11 runoff primary, in the November 7 general election. He received 2,512,197 votes (58.2 percent) to Alvarado's 1,616,945 (37.4 percent). Libertarian Judy A. Baker polled another 188,956 votes (4.4 percent).\nIn 2014, however, Dewhurst did not secure re-nomination for a fourth term as Texas Lieutenant Governor, losing in a runoff to Dan Patrick.\nTexas Children First initiative\nDewhurst was known for his \"Texas Children First\" initiative which focused on cracking down on child sexual predators in Texas and throughout the United States. The initiative includes extending the statute of limitations on child sex crimes and leading the passage of Jessica's Law to help keep Texas children safe. Dewhurst also attempted to pass legislation that would allow for the death penalty to be imposed on second-time violent child predators. This bill generated some controversy as it has been recognized that the death penalty for anything other than murder is unconstitutional. Nobody has been executed in the US for a crime other than murder since 1964.[4]\nWeapons training for teachers\nOn January 11, 2013, Dewhurst called for state-funded firearms training for teachers and administrators. Per his proposal, school districts would nominate who would carry weapons on campus and training would be more extensive than what is required for a concealed handgun license.[5]\n2003 Redistricting\nIn 2003, Dewhurst assisted the Republican leadership, including then U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, Texas House Speaker Tom Craddick, and Governor Rick Perry, in passing a sweeping congressional redistricting bill that increased the number of Republican U.S. House seats in Texas from 15 to 21 in the 2004 elections. Minority Democrats were left with 11 seats. In his capacity as the presiding officer of the Texas Senate, Dewhurst, in the third consecutive special session called by the governor, allowed the suspension of the custom that 2/3 of the body must vote to consider a bill.[6]\nDewhurst's leadership on redistricting brought him into legal conflict with his former land commissioner opponent, Richard Raymond. Raymond was the only elected official to be a plaintiff in the 2006 U.S. Supreme Court review of the constitutionality of the DeLay-Perry-Craddick-Dewhurst redistricting plan. Dewhurst and Raymond have also sparred over education policy.\nTexas Land Commissioner (1998-2003)\nDewhurst was elected Texas Land Commissioner in 1998. A self-described \"George Bush Republican,\" he defeated Democratic State Representative Richard Raymond of Benavides for the position. Dewhurst accused Raymond of being a \"career politician.\" Dewhurst received 2,072,604 votes (57.42 percent) to Raymond's 1,438,378 ballots (39.85 percent). A Libertarian polled the remaining 2.72 percent.[7]\nElections\n2014\nDewhurst ran for re-election in 2014.[8] In the primary on March 4, Dewhurst came second and faced a runoff with Dan Patrick on May 27, in which he also came second, losing the Republican nomination to Texas State Senator Dan Patrick.\n- Primary\n| Texas Lieutenant Gubernatorial Republican Primary, 2014 | ||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Candidate | Vote % | Votes | ||\n| Dan Patrick | 41.4% | 552,692 | ||\n| David Dewhurst Incumbent | 28.3% | 377,856 | ||\n| Todd Staples | 17.8% | 236,949 | ||\n| Jerry Patterson | 12.5% | 166,399 | ||\n| Total Votes | 1,333,896 | |||\n| Election results via Texas Secretary of State. |\n- Runoff\n| Texas Lieutenant Gubernatorial Republican Runoff, 2014 | ||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Candidate | Vote % | Votes | ||\n| Dan Patrick | 65% | 489,586 | ||\n| David Dewhurst Incumbent | 35% | 263,194 | ||\n| Total Votes | 752,780 | |||\n| Election results via Texas Secretary of State. |\nRace background\nPrimary defeat for Dewhurst\nLieutenant Governor David Dewhurst was the only incumbent running for re-election in 2014 while a number of other Republicans vied for his office, including two incumbents in other statewide executive offices.\nIn the primary, Dewhurst came second to State Senator Dan Patrick. After the primary on March 4, Republican lobbyists encouraged the three second-place candidates involved in runoffs to drop out of their respective races and decide the Republican nominations early. Incumbent Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and Texas Representative Dan Branch, second-place finishers for lieutenant governor and attorney general respectively, refused to do so and said that they would continue campaigning. The second-place Republican running for comptroller, however, dropped out, reducing the number of Republican runoffs to two.[9]\nIn the runoff on May 27, Patrick defeated Dewhurst again, securing the Republican nomination. This result meant that there were no incumbent state executives who won re-election in the 2014 elections.\nMoney in the race\n2013\nFor the reporting period ending June 30, 2013, Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples had $3 million in his campaign fund. Sen. Dan Patrick had $2.1 million, and Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst had $1.73 million.[10] Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson had $1.3 million cash-on-hand, raising $417,000 in the last two weeks of June 2014.[11]\nEndorsements\n- Texas Right to Life PAC[12]\n- Texas Fraternal Order of Police\n- Texas Municipal Police Association\n- Department of Public Safety Officers Association Political Action Committee\n- Texas State Association of Fire Fighters\n- Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas\n- Texas Farm Bureau’s political committee[13]\nImpeachment of Obama\nDuring an event for the Northeast Tarrant Tea Party on October 14, 2013, Dewhurst called for the impeachment of President Barack Obama. Dewhurst stated the 2014 race “is about protecting you and your freedoms, which are given to you by God, but which are being trampled on by Barack Obama right now. I don’t know about you, but Barack Obama ought to be impeached. Not only for trampling on our liberties, but what he did in Benghazi is just a crime.”[14]\n2012\nDewhurst announced on July 19, 2011, that he would be running for the US Senate in 2012, aiming to fill the vacancy left by the retirement of Kay Bailey Hutchison. He said his campaign would be \"straightforward, unapologetically conservative and as serious as the problems we face.\"[15]\nDewhurst and Ted Cruz defeated Joe Agris, Curt Cleaver, Glenn Addison, Ben Gambini, Craig James, Tom Leppert, and Lela Pittenger in the Republican primary on May 29, 2012. Dewhurst was then defeated in the July 31st primary runoff election by Cruz.[16][17]\n- Primary\n- Cruz won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in the primary runoff election on July 31, 2012.[18]\n| Candidate | Vote % | Votes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Ted Cruz | 56.8% | 631,812 |\n| David Dewhurst | 43.2% | 480,126 |\n| Total Votes | 1,111,938 |\n2010\nDewhurst defeated Linda Chavez-Thompson (D), Herb Gonzales, Jr. (G) and Scott Jameson (L) in the general election on November 2, 2010.[19]\n| Lieutenant Governor of Texas, 2010 | ||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Party | Candidate | Vote % | Votes | |\n| Republican | David Dewhurst Incumbent | 61.8% | 3,049,109 | |\n| Democratic | Linda Chavez-Thompson | 34.8% | 1,719,202 | |\n| Libertarian | Scott Jameson | 2.5% | 122,142 | |\n| Green | Herb Gonzales, Jr. | 0.9% | 44,903 | |\n| Total Votes | 4,935,356 | |||\n| Election results via Texas Secretary of State |\n2006\nDewhurst was easily renominated for Lieutenant Governor of Texas in the Republican primary held on March 7, 2006.

Governor David Dewhurst was abusing his office when he tried to gain release of a relative jailed in Allen, but Allen police disagree.\nThe audiotape of Dewhurst’s 12-minute phone conversation with officers was made available to the public Wednesday, and it’s created a political storm that may follow Dewhurst to the ballot box as he campaigns for reelection.\nOn the August 3 recording Dewhurst identifies himself numerous times as a top political official.\nHe began the conversation by saying, “This is David Dewhurst and I want to talk to the senior officer who is there right now.”\nDewhurst explained that his nephew’s wife had been arrested for shoplifting groceries but he believed she was innocent. He wanted to know what he needed to do to gain her release.\nAt one point he asked for the cell phone number of a judge who might be arraigning the woman later that day.

Warner hit the road, making 14 stops across Southwest and Southside Virginia to highlight a wealth of accomplishments from a session of Congress that he believes “will be looked back upon as one of the most productive years – literally – since the 1960s.”\nFrom Wise to Washington to Wythe, and everywhere in between, Sen. Warner met Virginians, talking to kids about biscuits and civic engagement… to education leaders about access to high-speed internet… and to residents and volunteers about the devastation caused by flooding in Buchanan County. He also toured revitalization efforts in downtown Danville… sat down with community leaders to discuss manufacturing expansion opportunities in New River Valley… and even exchanged famous recipes with Russell County’s very own Linda Skeens, who won an astounding number of ribbons at the Virginia-Kentucky State Fair earlier this year. Rumor has it that Ms. Skeens has even agreed to include Sen. Warner’s tuna melt recipe in her upcoming cookbook.\nSen. Warner also proudly delivered millions in federal funding for very worthy projects that seek to improve access to rural health and dental care, as well as tackle food insecurity and substance use disorder. He also discussed and answered questions pertaining to some major accomplishments out of Washington, including his landmark infrastructure law, his law to restore American technological leadership and manufacturing of semiconductors, and President Biden’s recent signing of the Inflation Reduction Act, which lowers prescription drug costs, closes tax loopholes for billionaire corporations, and provides financial security for miners by extending the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund excise tax at a higher rate.\nBristol Herald Courier: Senator Warner's visit to Wise County Health Wagon is worth $1.25 million\nWISE, Va. – U.S. Sen. Mark Warner looked around the most quiet Wise County Fairgrounds Monday and remembered more hectic times.\nWarner, D-Va., returned to the fairgrounds – longtime host site of Remote Area Medical clinics -- to formally present $1.25 million to the Health Wagon for construction of its new dental clinic.\n“The reason why this fairgrounds is so special, it was 2002 – the first year I was governor – and I’d heard about what you guys were doing here,” Warner said prior to the check presentation. “I remember dentists from all over the commonwealth, but who was going to show up? It ended up being thousands and thousands of people – not only Southwest Virginia but from Michigan, from Florida – driving for days just to come here and get dental assistance.”\nWarner returned many times, brought each of his children to help volunteer and had his Senate staff members come from across the state to volunteer so they better understood the issues.\n“The memories I have are of hot days, 60-70 chairs at once where people were being taken care of,” he said. “One of the things that was so typical of Southwest was it was people caring for people. No matter how much crummy stuff was going on in the country or around the world, you could not come to the whole effort and not come away with a belief in the basic goodness of people.”\nSimilar efforts – on a lesser scale -- are underway at the fairgrounds for much of this week. About 100 military personnel and volunteer dentists and other health care providers are offering free health care, X-rays, dental care and vision screenings. Similar to RAM, the event is the Move Mountains medical mission. Appointments are required, but there is no charge for care.\n“What’s happening at the fairgrounds is great. It is not a permanent, long-term solution,” Warner said. “\nThe $1.25 million in Congressionally designated spending will go toward construction of the Health Wagon’s new dental clinic, now being built in Wise.\n[…]\nMartinsville Bulletin: Stuart hospital to reopen in 2023; two mobile health units coming to Patrick Co. soon\nThe Stuart hospital that closed in 2017 has an aggressive timeline of being reopened in 2023 with the help of a bipartisan effort between Virginia officials and a $600,000 check to better the health care available in Patrick County with the addition of two mobile medical units.\nPioneer Community Hospital of Patrick in Stuart closed in 2017 after filing for bankruptcy in 2016 due to financial hardships. A crowd of over 30 people gathered to hear the official announcement of the reopening.\n“At this time last year, we were a county that didn’t have a hospital or even one on the horizon and had extremely limited means of providing adequate health care to our citizens, tourists and local businesses,” Patrick County Director of Economic Development Sean Adkins said. “Fast forward to today, and we stand at the site of our future Foresight Hospital of Patrick County opening in 2023.”\n[…]\n“This is a team effort,” Warner (D-Va.) said. “Patrick County is a special place … Getting these hospitals reopened is an enormous, enormous challenge and what your delegate [Virginia Delegate Wren Williams (R-9th District)] did, the process … was expedited. This would not be happening anywhere near this time without his good work.”\n“Over the last 25 years, there have been close to a thousand rural hospitals that have closed across America,” Warner said. “And there have been virtually none that have reopened … There will be federal hurdles that we’ve got to go over … This is a very aggressive timeline … But the idea of getting this hospital reopened by 2023, ambitious, but you’ve got our commitment that we’ll do our part in the federal stage.”\n[…]\nCoalfield Progress: Senator talks health care, brings funding\nWISE — U.S. Sen. Mark Warner and state Sen. Todd Pillion discussed the area’s dental services, insulin prices and black lung benefits Monday when visiting The Health Wagon’s Move Mountains Medical Mission.\nRoughly 100 Army, Navy and Air Force medical personnel were on site to render medical service as part of an Innovative Readiness Training program.\nWarner thanked the troops for protecting the country, which involves providing medical assistance to those in need, he said.\nHealth Wagon CEO Teresa Tyson said dental work has seen the highest demand, with more than 1,600 procedures performed since the start of the mission, Aug. 15.\nThe General Assembly recently improved the reimbursement rates for dentists providing Medicaid services for the first time in 17 years, said Pillion, and this momentum needs to continue.\nWarner later presented Health Wagon officials a $1.25 million check to build a new dental office, which is currently under construction. Warner and U.S. Sen Tim Kaine secured the money through Congress' member-directed funding policy.\nWarner said insulin prices need to be capped and that if the Democrats win the majority in the November congressional elections, the effort to achieve this will be renewed.\nThe $35 cap on insulin copays for Medicare beneficiaries should extend to everyone, Warner said.\nWhile mentioning the exponentially increasing rate of black lung in young miners, Warner said the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act establishes black lung benefits on a permanent basis.\nThe act includes a permanent extension of the Black Lung Excise Tax, which is the only revenue source for the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.\nThe News & Press: Putting points on the board, Warner touts string of legislative victories\nRICHLANDS, Va. – U.S. Senator Mark Warner (D – Va.) came to Richlands Monday on the heels of a string on legislative victories that has transformed a stalled Democratic agenda to a series of accomplishments the senator could tout to constituents.\n[…]\nHe said the major infrastructure bill has money that should allow 98% of Southwest Virginia homes to have high speed internet at a rate of less than $35 per month by 2024-2025.\nWarner said miners and their families now have Black Lung benefits guaranteed thanks to legislation introduced by him and Joe Manchin.\nHe said the U.S. is going to do what Canada and other countries do and use the power of negotiation to bring down the cost of medicine. Warner said the hope is to get the cost of insulin below $35 for senior citizens right away and eventually for everyone.\n[…]\nWarner spoke with State Senator Travis Hackworth about the need for affordable housing. Hackworth said the area from New River Valley down has a projection of 10,000 new jobs but the biggest drawback is the need for affordable housing.\n[…]\nHe said the people of Ukraine have given him hope and restored his faith that we have the best system of government.\n“The people In Ukraine have said we will sacrifice our lives to have the kind of system you have. The right to vote, the right to a free press and the right to disagree with each other,” Warner said.\nBristol Herald Courier: Warner aims to bring microchip production back to America\nU.S. Sen. Mark Warner made stops in Marion and Wytheville Tuesday on a three-day tour of Southwest and Southside Virginia to talk with community leaders.\nAmong the topics at the forefront of the conversation were the state of the manufacturing industry, improving Virginia’s infrastructure and Warner’s CHIPS bill.\nAt both stops Warner touted the recent passing of what he called a “once in a generation infrastructure law.”\n“What does that mean for Virginia? It means $8 billion for our road system… it means rail all the way to Christiansburg, and I’m committed as long as I have this job to making sure that rail system goes all the way to Bristol. It means money for all the airports… It means resources for water and sewer.”\nThe package also includes $65 billion to improve broadband access, an effort Virginia has already begun to tackle.\n[…]\nWarner also discussed his bill to increase semiconductor production in the U.S., saying the supply chain issues with the chips are a contributing factor to high inflation, particularly with the price of vehicles.\n“We have tens of thousands of cars that American auto companies have made,” Warner said. “They are sitting in lots in Michigan and Ohio and can’t get to market because we don’t make enough semi-conductor chips.”\nThirty to 40 years ago, Warner said, the U.S. made about 40% of all semiconductor chips in the world.\n“Now we make 12%,” Warner said.\nHe said the U.S. doesn’t make the cutting-edge chips used in advanced technology, airplanes or satellites.\n“They’re made in China. They’re made in Taiwan. And I can assure you, as the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, it is a national security risk if we don’t bring that semiconductor manufacturing back to this country,” Warner said.\n[…]\nRichmond Times Dispatch: Chesterfield, Henrico, 2 other Va. localities vie for semiconductor chip sites\nHadis Morkoc, a professor of electrical engineering and physics, led a tour Thursday at VCU’s Virginia Microelectronics Center for a group that included Sen. Mark Warner.\nFour local governments — including Chesterfield and Henrico counties — are pitching potential sites for large semiconductor chip factories to take advantage of a new federal law that dangles billions of dollars of incentives to return manufacturing of the critical microelectronic component to the United States.\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., one of the principal authors of the CHIPS + Science Act that President Joe Biden signed into law on Aug. 9, convened a roundtable discussion in Richmond on Thursday to showcase sites that the state is marketing to attract big investments by manufacturers eager to take advantage of $40 billion in new federal subsidies for domestic production of semiconductor chips.\n“I think Virginia is going to be very competitive,” Warner said in an interview after the meeting and a tour of the Virginia Microelectronics Center at Virginia Commonwealth University. “But we have to realize that certain states at this point are a bit ahead.”\n“We’re going to have to put up incentive packages that are frankly much larger than we have in the past,” he said, citing competition from states such as Ohio, Texas, Arizona and New York.\nThe 90-minute meeting included big county delegations led by Chesterfield County Administrator Joe Casey and Henrico County Manager John Vithoulkas as well as representatives for other potential semiconductor chip manufacturing sites in Pittsylvania County, outside of Danville, and Chesapeake in southeastern Virginia.\n[…]\nVirginia Business: Va. officials woo chip manufacturers\nU.S. Sen. Mark Warner and state and local economic development officials are vying to attract semiconductor chip manufacturing facilities to four Virginia industrial sites as the commonwealth gears up to fight for a piece of the financial pie from sweeping federal legislation that promises to ramp up chip production in the U.S.\nRepresentatives of Chesterfield, Henrico and Pittsylvania counties and the cities of Chesapeake and Danville joined with Warner, Virginia Economic Development Partnership President and CEO Jason El Koubi and Micron Technology Inc.’s senior vice president and general counsel, Rob Beard, Thursday during a meeting at Virginia Commonwealth University to discuss how to make Virginia more competitive. Officials from VCU and Virginia Tech also attended the meeting, which was closed to the press and public.\nThe meeting coincided with President Joe Biden issuing an executive order Thursday to kickstart the $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act, calling for swift implementation of a component of the bill that provides $52.7 billion in funding for domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research. Biden’s executive order establishes an interagency steering council to coordinate implementation of that funding, co-chaired by National Economic Director Brian Deese, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Alondra Nelson, the acting director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n[…]\nIt was initially introduced in 2020 in an earlier form by Warner, Virginia’s Democratic senior senator, and Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn; the act was passed by Congress this summer and Biden signed it into law on Aug. 9.\nAccording to the Semiconductor Industry Association, the U.S.’s share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity has decreased from 37% in 1990 to 12% today because other nations have been outpacing the U.S. in investing in the industry.\nAs chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Warner has been outspoken about the need for domestic chip manufacturing. It’s a refrain he returned to Thursday as he toured labs at VCU’s C. Kenneth and Dianne Harris Wright Virginia Microelectronics Center.\n“We’ve seen over the last 30 years, America dominated this industry to now … we only make about 12%,” Warner said. “And America, on the manufacturing side, we don’t make any of the cutting-edge chips.”\n‘In the hunt’\nSeveral sites in Virginia offer the space needed for the potential manufacture of semiconductors, which can require up to 1,000 acres, Warner said. A likely location for a new plant could be found in rural Southern or Southwestern Virginia.\n[…]\nWhile there may be shovel-ready sites to lure manufacturers, those locations alone might not be enough.\nNew York, Texas, Arizona and Ohio have “really raised the bar in going after semiconductors,” Romanello said.\nTo compete, Virginia needs to offer greater incentives.\n“One of the things I think Virginia is going to need to do is both have sites prepared but also be willing to put more resources into these packages if we’re going to be competitive,” Warner said, citing New York’s corporate subsidy of up to $10 billion in tax credits for “green” semiconductor manufacturers over a 20-year period, enacted on Aug. 11, among other states’ incentives.\n[…]\nBeyond attracting the major chip manufacturers, officials told Virginia Business they’re looking at the entire semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem, which includes the supply chain for components and related materials. And that provides even more opportunities, El Koubi said.\n“We are both looking at opportunities for Virginia to attract the semiconductor [fabrication] opportunities themselves for large semiconductor plants, but we’re also looking at ways to cultivate the ecosystem, building on Virginia’s existing strengths in the semiconductor space,” he said.\nThose strengths include close to 30 companies in the semiconductor industry — providing production, equipment testing, construction and other services — and an advanced manufacturing and related industries workforce numbering almost 350,000.\nWarner wants to see Virginia increase its capacity to manufacture the tools and equipment that go onto the “fab floors.” That’s a niche that has not yet been co-opted by Asian countries that otherwise dominate the semiconductor industry.\n[…]\nDanville Register & Bee: Swinging through Danville, Warner tours downtown, praises growth\nSen. Mark Warner made a stop in Danville on Wednesday afternoon, where he toured the River District and dropped by a few businesses.\nWarner’s visit was part of the Democrat’s three-day swing through Southwest and Southside Virginia, which included a visit to Stuart before he came to Danville and then headed to South Boston.\nDuring a meeting with about 20-25 community leaders after his walk with officials downtown, Warner praised the growth that has taken place in the River District.\nHe pointed out how empty downtown was several years ago and the resurgence of the River District since then, when “warehouses didn’t have a lot in them.” Now there are numerous locally owned businesses, including restaurants, retailers and other establishments.\n“There are great things happening in a lot of communities across Virginia,” Warner told officials in the former Pepsi Building next to the Danville Science Center. “I don’t think there’s anything on a per-capita basis that is close to what you guys are doing here.”\nDanville is attracting more people from other areas to come live here, he added.\n“Sixty percent of the people coming into the community are not from the community...” Warner said.\nHe also pointed out Averett and Danville Community College in the city. With a one-bedroom unit renting for $1,100 in the River District and “you’re all full up is really an enormous, enormous accomplishment,” Warner said.\n“I want to, you know, give you all the credit,” Warner said. “I hope that the community at large recognizes [that].”\nHe also referred to the decline of tobacco and textiles in the late 90s and early 2000s, which culminated in the closing of Dan River Inc.\n“Very few communities got whacked as hard as Danville did,” Warner said.\nCity leaders, including the mayor, economic development director and others, led Warner on a tour of downtown on a hot August day. Stops included Ma’s Cakes and Moss Mountain Outfitters on Main Street, The Bee Hotel on South Union Street and Knitting Mills Lofts on Lynn Street.\nDuring the meeting with leaders after the walk downtown, Warner said cooperation between Danville and Pittsylvania County is one factor that has made the community special.\n“We’re stronger combined than separated,” he said, adding that it is the model that can enable a lot of other communities around Virginia to perform better.\nWarner also touched upon national issues during his meeting with local officials.\nEverybody should have access to high-speed, affordable internet, Warner said, challenging local leaders to get training for the region’s workforce to meet that need. About 750,000 broadband installers will be needed across the country, he said.\nDanville needs a pop-up training center for that, he said.\n“I think that’s going to be an opportunity there,” Warner said, adding that Virginia also needs to get a microchip manufacturing site.\n[…]\nGazette Virginian: Warner calls Southside ‘the comeback region’ in South Boston stop\nU.S. Sen. Mark Warner spoke to a crowd of about 50 local leaders, professionals and residents Wednesday afternoon at the SOVA Innovation Hub in South Boston.\nThe visit was one stop on the senior senator from Virginia’s multi-community tour of Southside.\nInnovation Hub staff treated Warner to a brief tour of the facility, as the crowd waited for the senator’s comments.\n“I have known him for 30 years; he’s been a consistent friend of Southern Virginia,” South Boston Mayor Ed Owens said as he introduced the senator. “He’s one of the smartest businessmen I’ve ever met.”\nWarner expressed his admiration for Southside leaders and the community at large for their collective accomplishment of economic revitalization.\n“There is no part of the state that is more ‘the comeback region’ than Southside Virginia, and that has required grit, determination — lesser communities would have thrown in the towel,” Warner said.\nWarner focused on the accomplishments of Congress this year, suggesting that 2022 has been one of the most significant congressional terms since the civil rights era.\n“I think this last year in the United States Congress will be looked back upon as one of the most productive years, literally since the 1960s,” he said.\nWarner further added that bipartisanship has figured into the equation of the successes he sees in legislative action this year focusing on the infrastructure bill among other efforts.\n[…]\nBristol Herald Courier: Biscuit complaints bring Warner to Ridgeview Middle School\nCLINTWOOD, Va. - It was complaints about bad biscuits that brought Senator Mark Warner (D-Va.) to Ridgeview Middle School Monday.\nLast school year, Ridgeview seventh-grade teachers April Hay and Portia Fletcher noticed their teenage students were not eating breakfast.\n“Especially boys, when they are not eating, something is wrong. I started questioning them about why they were not eating and they said, ‘Well, we don’t really like it,’” Hay said. “It was whole wheat instead of the white wheat, and they were just not eating it.”\nThe director of food services suggested Hay write a letter to the senator about the issue. Hay took the suggestion a step further and worked with Fletcher to turn petitioning the government for better biscuits into a writing assignment.\n“We went through the writing process to learn how to write a letter,” Hay said. “We sent those to the senator and I got a call one day from Richmond about it.”\nSenator Warner’s office said Warner had seen and read the letters and wanted to help. The first response came last year in the form of breakfast from Hardee’s for the class from Warner. Then representatives from Warner’s office said the senator wanted to come meet the students in person about their project.\n“We thought maybe we would get a nice letter or something from the senator,” Hay a teacher for 25 years said. “We never expected this much. This has been the highlight of our careers.”\nSo on the first day of the school year for Dickenson County, Warner met with the now eighth-grade class to say hello and answer questions, including a query asking if he has any aspirations beyond being a U.S. senator, which would be a run for president. After explaining he felt like he was in a good place to get things done for Virginia as senator, Warner did not reveal any potential presidential run to the auditorium full of eighth graders.\n“I’m not sure that is in my future,” Warner said. “I don’t think it probably is in my future.”\nWarner also met with area school superintendents and county officials discussing a variety of topics such as broadband access, mental health assistance for students and the issues surrounding teacher shortages.\nWarner said he fears the recent controversies surrounding school boards would dissuade citizens from running for office leaving seats vacant in the future.\n“I can’t think of a job that’s got less perks or upside and more grief. School board members have always been citizens who care about their community and I just worry that sometimes people’s anger and frustration have gotten so awful at some of these school board meetings around the country that people will just say, ‘I’m done,’ and that would be a huge loss not just to our education system, but to our democracy,” Warner said.\nBristol Virginia Schools Superintendent Dr. Keith Perrigan was one of the local school officials in attendance at the event. He said Warner has always been a big supporter of the public school system.\n“Senator Warner, even back when he was governor, has always been a huge supporter of public education,” Perrigan said. “Obviously, at the federal level he doesn’t have the same opportunities that he did when he was governor, but he is always willing to listen and willing try to find a solution.”\n###\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        We're sorry but client doesn't work properly without JavaScript enabled.

When you look at that over the course of two years, Politifact explains, that only comes out to 3,900 “average annual” jobs. Most of the construction jobs in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas, through which the pipeline will pass, will rely on specialists brought in from out of state.\nTransCanada’s CEO, Russ Girling, further stretched the truth into an outright lie on ABC’s “This Week” Sunday morning, claiming that the State Department called those 42,000 jobs “ongoing” and “enduring.” Again, Politifact corrects the record, explaining that, for the reasons above, those adjectives only apply if you have an incredibly short-sighted definition of “ongoing and enduring” (read: two years or less).\nBut if you really want to get an idea of how hard the jobs myth is to squash, look no further than lefty news channel MSNBC, where host Joe Scarborough propagated that same false narrative. Questioning a potential decision to delay the pipeline, he laughed: “Their own State Department says it’s going to create 50,000 new jobs.”\nAgain: not.\nYou know what already did create tens of thousands of jobs, in nearly every state? Renewable energy, which according to a report from Environmental Entrepreneurs created almost 80,000 of them in 2013 alone. The main thing holding back future growth, that same report found, is “ongoing regulatory uncertainty,” most notably with wind energy tax credits. It’s worth checking out, especially if you happen to be a politician who’s legitimately looking for a way to grow the economy.\nThose other persuasive arguments for approving the pipeline, for the record, don’t hold up much better: The part of the State Department review finding that Keystone would have a negligible impact on the environment, for one, is made extremely suspect by the multiple conflicts of interest surrounding it. The local impacts of leaks and the global impacts of emitting any more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere would suggest otherwise; another study evaluating the State Department’s analysis concluded that the report downplays the pipeline’s environmental significance.\nStudies have established that the pipeline isn’t going to reduce the United States’ dependence on foreign oil. And over at the Washington Post, Philip Bump has the ultimate explainer for why it isn’t going to lower gas prices in any straightforward way — it some regions, in fact, it could even raise them. What he boils it all down to: “The most direct beneficiaries of Keystone XL won’t be consumers.”\nHere’s Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on CNN, trying to wrap his mind around the idea that approving the pipeline would make any kind of sense whatsoever:\nOh, and one other job pushing the pipeline won’t be able to ensure? Sen. Landrieu’s, as voters don’t seem to have been swayed by her pro-Keystone rhetoric. Although, as Salon writers Luke Brinker and Joan Walsh have both pointed out, we can expect to see a brand-new position with the oil lobby created just for her once this is all over.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        A Facebook post: Says that \"By revoking the Keystone pipeline permit, Biden is destroying 11,000 jobs.”\nPolitiFact's ruling: Half True\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nHere's why: President Joe Biden spent his first day in the White House signing a spate of executive orders aimed at undoing the policies of the Trump administration. One of them sparked outrage on Facebook over its effect on American jobs.\nOn Jan. 20, Biden signed an order that revoked the permit for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. In a Facebook post published the same day, one user said the move would cost thousands of jobs.\n\"By revoking the Keystone pipeline permit, Biden is destroying 11,000 jobs and roughly $2 billion in wages,\" the post says. \"Democrats couldn’t even get through Day 1 without killing jobs for middle class Americans.\"\nWant more Statesman?\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nWe’ve seen several similar posts offer other figures for how many jobs were lost as a result of Biden’s executive order, ranging from 12,000 to 83,000. So we wanted to take a closer look.\nTC Energy Corp., the Canadian company that owns the Keystone XL pipeline with the Alberta government, has said more than 1,000 people are out of work because of Biden’s executive order. The 11,000 and $2 billion figures cited in the Facebook post are estimates published by the company, but most of the jobs would be temporary.\nWe reached out to the user who published the post for their evidence, but we didn’t hear back.\nWhat Biden’s order does\nThe Keystone XL pipeline is an international project years in the making. Without support from the U.S. government, it’s effectively halted.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nThe 875-mile pipeline would carry a heavy crude oil mixture from Western Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries.\nBiden’s order revokes the permit that was granted March 29, 2019, by then-President Donald Trump on the grounds that it is harmful to the environment.\nWhile an 11-volume State Department report on the Keystone XL pipeline found in 2014 that it would not significantly contribute to carbon pollution, critics say the project threatens Alberta’s rivers and forests. And the project has become a symbol for the political debate over fossil fuels.\nThe Obama-era State Department had denied TC Energy’s request for a permit in 2015. Trump revived hopes for the project once he took office, ultimately approving it with an executive order. Construction began in April 2020, but that same month, a federal court said that the project had to go through a full endangered species review. TC Energy appealed the ruling, but the Supreme Court upheld it in July.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nBefore Biden signed his executive order, only a 1.2-mile section of the pipeline had been completed in Montana near the U.S.-Canada border.\n‘Thousands’ of lost jobs, but most are temporary\nOver the past several years, we’ve fact-checked many claims that the Keystone XL pipeline would create thousands of American jobs. Several of them lack context about the duration and nature of these positions, and this Facebook post is similar.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nIn a Jan. 20 statement, TC Energy said Biden’s order \"would directly lead to the layoff of thousands of union workers.\" It did not specify exactly how many jobs would be lost.\nPresident Richard Prior told the Associated Press that the layoffs would number more than 1,000. We reached out to TC Energy for more information, but we haven’t heard back.\nThe 11,000 figure in the Facebook post appears to stem from an Oct. 28 press release on the pipeline’s website.\nIn October, TC Energy awarded contracts to six American union contractors to build the Keystone XL pipeline in three states in 2021. Those contractors were \"responsible for hiring 7,000 union workers.\"\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n\"When combined with additional 2021 contracts to be announced later, the total number of American union workers constructing Keystone XL in 2021 will exceed 8,000 and $900 million in gross wages,\" the release said. \"In total, Keystone XL is expected to employ more than 11,000 Americans in 2021, creating more than $1.6 billion in gross wages.\"\nThat’s close to what the State Department found in its 2014 report.\nIn the report, the agency wrote that 10,400 estimated positions would be for seasonal construction work lasting four to eight-month periods. Since the State Department defines \"job\" as \"one position that is filled for 1 year,\" that would equate to approximately 3,900 jobs over a two-year period.\nIn short: Most of the estimated jobs were temporary.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nThe State Department forecasted that no more than 50 jobs, some of which could be located in Canada, would be required to maintain the pipeline. Thirty-five of them would be permanent, while 15 would be temporary contractors.\nWe reached out to the White House for a comment, but we haven’t heard back.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post says that Biden’s executive order revoking the Keystone XL pipeline \"is destroying 11,000 jobs.\"\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nThat number is an estimate, and the claim lacks context about the longevity of Keystone jobs.\nTC Energy said more than 1,000 people are out of work because of Biden’s executive order. In October, the company said it expected to employ more than 11,000 Americans in 2021 and generate more than $1.6 in gross wages.\nBut both TC Energy and the State Department have said the majority of those jobs would be temporary. A 2014 report found that the company would need only 50 employees to maintain the Keystone XL pipeline once it’s finished, 35 of them permanent.\nTemporary jobs are still jobs.

But the likely story in question — a Washington Post story on former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s discussions about sanctions with the Russian ambassador in December — was confirmed by the White House.\n- Trump doubled down on his exaggeration about crime in Sweden as a result of its liberal policy of accepting refugees from Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.\n- Trump made the curious claim that “Obamacare covers very few people,” despite the fact that the number of uninsured Americans has fallen by 20 million since the health care law was enacted.\n- Trump said that building the Keystone XL pipeline could lead to “somewhere around” 42,000 jobs. The State Department estimated that many “direct, indirect and induced” jobs could be created temporarily. But after construction, only 50 workers would be required to operate the pipeline.\n- He also repeated exaggerations about NAFTA’s impact on the economy, welfare, and the election’s impact on job growth — taking credit for recently announced investments.\n- Trump said that a Los Angeles Times poll “did a great job” predicting his election victory. Actually, the poll wrongly predicted that Trump would win the popular vote.\nThe Feb. 24 speech was Trump’s fifth appearance at the annual conference, but his first as president. Trump signaled his presidential aspirations in his first appearance at CPAC back in 2011, when he made headlines for questioning President Barack Obama’s birth certificate. And he built up his conservative following in subsequent appearances in 2013, 2014 and 2015.\nOn ‘Fake’ News and Anonymous Sources\nTrump opined that media “shouldn’t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody’s name,” but his own White House staff regularly holds “on background” conversations with reporters with the condition that officials’ names not be used.\nIn fact, just hours before Trump’s speech, the White House held a “background briefing by senior administration officials” (with the condition that those sources not be named) to push back against news reports that some members of Trump’s campaign had communicated with Russian officials during the campaign.\nTrump: I’m against the people that make up stories and make up sources. They shouldn’t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody’s name. Let their name be put out there. Let their name be put out. “A source says that Donald Trump is a horrible, horrible human being.” Let ’em say it to my face. Let there be no more sources.\nThe use of anonymous sources has long been debated in media circles. Some argue its necessity, while others warn of its risks to credibility, and caution against its overuse. Some newspapers eschew the practice entirely. Last year, the New York Times announced stricter guidelines for using anonymous sources, requiring the approval of a top editor.\nSo Trump is certainly entitled to his opinion. But we’d be remiss if we didn’t point out the hypocrisy of this stance. Trump administration officials regularly hold “on background” briefings with reporters on the condition that officials not be named (as did the Obama administration before it).\nAs ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl pointed out, the same morning that Trump gave his CPAC speech, the White House gave some reporters a background briefing by senior administration officials on the condition that reporters couldn’t use the officials’ names. According to a press pool report filed by Dan Freedman of Hearst Newspapers, the officials provided “major pushback” on news reports that Trump campaign aides had repeated contacts with Russian intelligence officials during the campaign. The anonymous White House officials relayed purported details of private conversations between Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, and FBI Director James Comey and FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.\nAt a press briefing after Trump’s speech, Press Secretary Sean Spicer noted that reporters had obtained permission to use some of his quotes on the record. Said Spicer: “There’s a big difference between making serious allegations, us coming back on the record, and reporters saying ‘well, we have five sources, that are unnamed, that say contrary to that.’ I think there’s a point at which there’s an obligation if you’re going to make a very serious allegation, and we’re willing to push back on the record, that there be somebody at the very least who’s willing to push back on this and say they’ll put their name attached to it.”\nBut the White House has done these background briefings before. (See these recent examples here, here and here.)\nAnd Trump has cited anonymous sources himself, as he did in his CPAC speech when he quoted a “very, very substantial guy” who told him “Paris is no longer Paris” due to the influx of immigrants. CNBC’s Steve Kopack also pointed out this 2012 tweet from Trump:\nAn 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 6, 2012\nTrump also quibbled with the fact that many media outlets reported on his tweet that the “FAKE NEWS media … is the enemy of the American people” without noting his qualifier of “fake” news.\nTrump: They’re very dishonest people. In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people. The fake news. They dropped off the word “fake.” And all of a sudden the story became the media is the enemy. They take the word “fake” out. And now I’m saying, “Oh no, this is no good.” But that’s the way they are.\nIt’s true that Trump — who once cited the National Enquirer as a credible news source worthy of a Pulitzer to back up his bogus conspiracy theory of Ted Cruz’s father being linked to Lee Harvey Oswald — added the “FAKE” qualifier to his comment. But he cast a wide net when explaining which news outlets he considered to be “fake news,” including the New York Times, NBC News, ABC News, CBS News and CNN.\nThe FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017\nThat’s a wide swath of the mainstream media. We should note that fact-checkers also have been denounced by Trump as “dishonest scum.” Trump lobbed that insult during a speech in Florida in October, in which he said “so-called fact-checkers” are “really crooked as hell themselves.”\nA ‘Fake News’ Story with ‘Nine Sources’?\nTrump also accused the media of making up sources, in particular criticizing one story that contained nine sources. He said, “There’re no nine people. I don’t believe there was one or two people.”\nTrump: A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people. And they are. They are the enemy of the people. Because they have no sources, they just make ’em up when there are none. I saw one story recently where they said, “Nine people have confirmed.” There’re no nine people. I don’t believe there was one or two people. Nine people. And I said, “Give me a break.” Because I know the people, I know who they talk to. There were no nine people. But they say “nine people.” And somebody reads it and they think, “Oh, nine people. They have nine sources.” They make up sources. They’re very dishonest people.\nWe asked the White House to identify the story, but we did not receive a response. There was one recent story that had nine sources, and it turned out to be accurate, not “fake” at all. That was the Washington Post story on Feb. 9 that broke the news that then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn “privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials.”\nThat story said, “Nine current and former officials, who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the calls, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.”\nTrump knew “for a few weeks” — since January — that Flynn spoke to the Russian ambassador about sanctions even though Flynn told Vice President Mike Pence that he did not, White House spokesman Sean Spicer confirmed at his Feb. 14 briefing. But Flynn did not resign — at Trump’s request — until a few days after the Post broke the story.\nIn his Feb. 14 resignation letter, Flynn acknowledged that he “inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador.”\nAfter Flynn resigned, Trump criticized the “fake media” for treating Flynn “very, very unfairly.” But, as we wrote, the White House confirmed media reports on Flynn’s call with the Russian ambassador, so the stories — including the one by the Post based on the nine sources — was not fake at all.\nMarty Baron, the executive editor of the Washington Post, issued a statement that said, “Everything we published regarding Gen. Flynn was true, as confirmed by subsequent events and on-the-record statements from administration officials themselves. The story led directly to the general’s dismissal as national security adviser. Calling press reports fake doesn’t make them so.”\nOn Sweden\nTrump doubled down on his exaggeration about crime in Sweden as a result of its liberal policy of accepting refugees from Syria and other Middle Eastern countries. As we wrote when Trump first cited Sweden as an example of problems associated with immigration, statistics show there has been an uptick in some crime categories since the country took in 160,000 asylum-seekers in 2015. But experts said there is no evidence of a major crime wave.\nTrump: I took a lot of heat on Sweden. And then a day later, I said has anybody reported what’s going on? And it turned out that they didn’t — not too many of them did. Take a look at what happened in Sweden. I love Sweden, great country, great people, I love Sweden. But they understand. The people over there understand I’m right. Take a look at what’s happening in Sweden.\nTrump may have been referring to riots that broke out in a predominantly immigrant neighborhood of Stockholm on Feb. 20, which included rock throwing at police, looting and 10 cars being torched. (Contrary to Trump’s claim, though, it was widely reported.)\nAnd Trump may have a point that a substantial portion of the Swedish public may perceive a crime problem due to refugees. A Pew Research Center survey in early 2016 found that 46 percent of Swedes believe “refugees in our country are more to blame for crime than other groups.”\nHowever, Swedish experts we spoke to said official crime statistics do not support Trump’s earlier claims. Overall, crime is relatively low in Sweden, and has generally been on the decline for decades. There has been an uptick in some categories of crimes over the last two years, but Swedish authorities and academic researchers say there is little evidence of a crime surge, or that immigrants are more prone to crime.\n“Obviously [it is] difficult to know” how the influx of refugees has impacted crime in Sweden, Felipe Estrada Dörner, a criminology professor at Stockholm University, told us via email. “What we do know is that the amount of resources that the police have coded as directly connected to the refugee situation is below 1 percent.”\nFor more on this issue, see our Feb. 20 story, “Trump Exaggerates Swedish Crime.”\nObamacare by the Numbers\nThe number of Americans lacking health insurance has fallen by 20 million since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, according to the National Health Interview Survey, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But Trump claimed the law covered “very few people.”\nTrump: Obamacare covers very few people — and remember, deduct from the number all of the people that had great health care that they loved that was taken away from them — it was taken away from them.\nThere are several ways to measure the change in insurance coverage under the ACA, and they all show a reduction in the uninsured in the millions. There’s no need to “deduct” anyone who lost insurance; the figures from the CDC show the total net numbers for the insured and uninsured in the country, as we wrote when Trump made a similar claim last month.\nThe latest CDC report, released in February, on the National Health Interview Survey — a survey of about 35,000 households conducted by the Census Bureau — shows that the number of uninsured Americans of all ages decreased from 48.6 million in 2010, the year the ACA was enacted, to 28.2 million for January through September 2016.\nThe country now has the lowest uninsured rate on record — 8.8 percent. The rate was 16 percent in 2010, and it has been declining every year since. (Historical data are here.)\nSince 2012, the year before the ACA federal and state marketplaces launched, the number of the uninsured has declined by 17.3 million.\nAnd we could look only at those who gained coverage through those ACA marketplaces, as some refer to the insurance marketplaces themselves as “Obamacare.” The number who selected an insurance plan through HealthCare.gov during the open enrollment period that ended January 31 was 9.2 million, and another 2.8 million signed up on the 12 state-based marketplaces as of December 24, 2016, according to reports from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\nCMS said it would release a final report in March. It’s likely that not everyone who selected a plan will pay their premium. In the first half of 2016, 10.4 million Americans had signed up and paid for insurance, with 84 percent of them getting tax credits to reduce their out-of-pocket premium costs.\nAnd then there’s the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA, which 31 states plus Washington, D.C., have implemented. “Studies show that Medicaid expansion results in significant coverage gains and reductions in uninsured rates,” said a February review by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation of more than 100 studies on the topic.\nTrump referred to people who had their “health care … taken away from them.” In 2013, some Americans received cancellation notices for their specific individual market plans that no longer met minimum benefit requirements under the ACA. An Urban Institute study and survey from December 2013 estimated the number getting such notices at 2.6 million. A RAND Corporation study from 2015 found that “the vast majority of those with individual market insurance in 2013 remained insured in 2015, which suggests that even among those who had their individual market policies canceled, most found coverage through an alternative source.”\nKeystone Job Estimates\nTrump said that building the Keystone XL pipeline could create “somewhere around” 42,000 jobs in the U.S. Yes, but only 16,000 direct jobs would be created temporarily during construction of the pipeline. The rest would be “indirect and induced jobs” resulting from money spent on goods and services by the construction contractors and employees.\nTrump: But with the Keystone … Bottom line, Obama didn’t sign it, right? Could be 42,000 jobs, somewhere around there — a lot of jobs.\nAs we have written before, the U.S. State Department’s 2014 analysis says that construction of the pipeline could lead to 42,100 direct, indirect and induced jobs. They wouldn’t last long, though.\nOf the 16,100 direct jobs, the State Department says “approximately 3,900 (or 1,950 per year if construction took 2 years) would comprise a direct, temporary, construction workforce in the proposed Project area” of Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas. The other 26,000 jobs are based on “indirect” work for companies supplying goods and services for the pipeline, as well as “induced” jobs resulting from money spent by workers and suppliers.\nAnd, again, these are temporary jobs, lasting one to two years while the pipeline is constructed. After that, “the proposed Project would generate approximately 50 jobs during operations,” according to the State Department’s analysis. That would include “35 permanent employees and 15 temporary contractors,” the report says.\nMore Repeats\nJobs: Trump again boasted that “jobs are already starting to pour back into our country” and that “because of the election result” companies such as Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Intel and others are “expanding production and hiring more workers.” But as we have reported repeatedly, many of the investments announced by those companies were in the works before the election and were largely market driven. Executives of those companies praised Trump’s plan to cut corporate taxes and reduce regulation, but several of them said the recently announced investments would have been made no matter who was elected president. We won’t know how Trump is doing on jobs until the Bureau of Labor Statistics comes out with its monthly figures for February, and it may take many more months or even years, to fully evaluate Trump’s impact on jobs.\nWelfare: Trump said, “It’s time for all Americans to get off of welfare and get back to work.” As we have written, the welfare rolls have dropped precipitously since President Clinton signed legislation in 1996 instituting work requirements and time limits. That legislation created the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, or TANF, which replaced the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program. The average monthly number of individuals on TANF has declined by about 75 percent, from 10.9 million recipients in fiscal 1997 to 2.8 million recipients in fiscal 2016.\nNAFTA: Trump called NAFTA “one of the worst deals ever made by any country” and labeled it “economy un-development, as far as our country is concerned.” There has been a 27 percent drop in manufacturing jobs from December 1993, the month before NAFTA took effect, to January of this year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But as we have noted in the past, many factors, beyond the 1994 trade agreement, impact jobs and the economy. And as we have written before, economists have debated the effects of the trade agreement. But overall, economists have found the net effect on jobs from NAFTA has been small, because trade with Canada and Mexico account for a small part of the GDP. A 2015 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service called the net overall effect of NAFTA “relatively modest.”\nAbout That L.A. Times Poll\nFinally, Trump said that a poll conducted by the University of Southern California and the Los Angeles Times was one of a few to correctly predict a Trump victory over Hillary Clinton.\n“A couple of polls got it right. I must say Los Angeles Times did a great job, shocking because, you know, they did a great job,” Trump said.\nBut as the Times’ own Washington bureau chief, David Lauter, pointed out, the poll actually got the popular vote forecast wrong.\n“The Daybreak poll, like any other survey, tries to forecast the actual vote,” Lauter wrote. “Its final national forecast had Trump winning 47%-44%.

And with the same cast of characters back at the helm under Biden, it’s no wonder why chaos has once again enveloped the Middle East. Besides Gordon’s fascinating history of the American policy failures that contributed to the rise of ISIS, his book also provides insightful guidance for an impending second Trump Administration, describing important lessons that can be gleaned from the Obama-Biden team’s mistakes.\nGordon’s thorough accounting begins with the initial failure to counter ISIS in 2012, followed by a desire to minimize and obfuscate the magnitude of the threat through 2013 and 2014. As Obama’s second term went on, the genesis of ISIS revealed an absence of any coherent foreign policy strategy in conjunction with the suffocating micromanagement of the military by Obama and his staff. Of note, nearly all of Obama’s advisors described in the book returned under Biden, having been promoted to new heights in response to their failures.\nThe misadventure continues with the botched withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq in 2013, overseen by then-Vice President Joe Biden and then-commander of U.S. Central Command and later Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. On the heels of the troop withdrawal, Biden and his longtime aide, Antony Blinken, assured the White House that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was a reliable ally who would steward Iraq post-U.S. involvement. Maliki, a Shia, instead inflamed sectarian violence, thus swelling the ranks of ISIS with Sunni fighters while allowing rampant corruption to rot an Iraqi military the U.S. spent billions creating.\nFrom 2012 to 2014, as ISIS rapidly conquered portions of Syria and Iraq, the Obama Administration refused to acknowledge the threat, regularly misleading the press. Obama infamously referred to the group as a “JV team” compared to al-Qaeda, Austin stated ISIS was simply a “flash in the pan,” and Blinken admonished the press for “misreporting” violence levels in Iraq.\nThough the failure to stop ISIS early on could have been disastrous, total catastrophe was ultimately avoided due only to the heroic actions of the Kurds of northeast Syria and northern Iraq in addition to Iranian-backed militias arriving to fill the power vacuum left by the rapid withdrawal of U.S. forces. The lack of a long-term regional strategy allowed Iran to effectively take over southern Iraq, ISIS to dominate its western half, and the Kurds to fight unsupported in the north. Iranian influence exploded across the region while the Obama team worked on funneling billions of dollars to Iran through the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\nThe result of American incongruity allowed ISIS affiliates to then proliferate around the globe while Europe became overwhelmed by a migration crisis that caused broader instability in the Middle East. Ultimately, this dynamic resulted in a wave of terrorist attacks in France, Germany, Belgium, and the U.K.\nCaught flatfooted, the Obama Administration attempted to compensate for its lack of any coherent strategy by overusing U.S. and Iraqi special operations forces. As the terrorist attacks spread—most prominently the Bataclan theater massacre in Paris of November 2015—and the 2016 election loomed, the Obama team finally became more aggressive, though still lacking a cohesive plan of action. In the days after the Paris attack, special operations troops (SOF) were thrown into the fray without clear guidance, authorities, or direction. SOF became the catch-all solution to all military problems.\nIn late 2015 and into 2016, the Kurdish Peshmerga finally began to see American military advisors arriving, even as the Obama team was reluctant to arm them out of fear that it would upset the Iraqi government. They mistakenly viewed Iranian militias operating across Iraq as the lesser evil, not understanding that the Iranian Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) would work to drive a wedge between Iraq and America far larger than the rift that would have developed from arming the Kurds. This is proven by Trump’s decision to arm the Kurds with little blowback. Instead of cooperating with the Kurds to defeat ISIS, the Iraqi Counterterrorism Service (CTS) became the go-to hammer for every nail, overworking the small, specialized unit. On the Syrian side of the border, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) became the designated ally, even as the Obama Administration refused to supply them with arms until its last week for fear of upsetting Türkiye.\nThe Trump Administration encompasses the final third of Gordon’s book and has fared far better in hindsight. The Trump team decided to arm the Peshmerga and SDF within a week of being inaugurated, expanding the lethality of forces fighting ISIS while offsetting Iranian militias. Though less structured at times, the Trump team managed to push forward the efficient destruction of terrorist networks in Iraq and Syria while expanding the fight to Libya, Somalia, Yemen, and the Philippines. In contrast with their predecessors, the Trump Administration also worked aggressively to reign in Iranian influence in Iraq, culminating in the killing of Qassem Soleimani in 2019.\nDegrade and Destroy leaves its reader with a sense of utter bafflement at the cognitive dissonance of the Obama Administration’s national security team, and particularly those in the orbit of then-Vice President Biden. When a Marine Staff Sergeant was killed and eight others wounded in Iraq in March 2016, the Obama team expended great effort arguing that the U.S. was not involved in combat on the ground. That such an argument over what exactly defines “combat” occurred nearly four years into the fight against ISIS poignantly illustrates America’s disastrously scrambled foreign policy under Obama.\nDegrade and Destroy does a wonderful job detailing the rise of the Islamic State as well as the disjointed American response spanning two administrations. That ISIS is still around and has rebounded significantly over the past three years, is an even larger indictment of some of the principal actors in this story. It becomes clear that most (if not all) of Obama’s team, including Secretary of Defense Austin, Secretary of State Blinken, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley, and National Security Council Coordinator Bret McGurk should have been fired. Yet, years later, amid the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, they had all been promoted instead.\nGordon’s account makes clear that so many American failures in the Middle East stemmed from a handful of experts, with their mistakes continuing to endanger America and our allies to this day. Yet, as Degrade and Destroy shows, all is not lost if the new Trump Administration can learn from Obama and Biden’s missteps by advancing a decisive and effective Middle East strategy.\nEnjoyed this article?

Be sure to check out the full roundtable.\nTurkey’s purchase of the S-400 missile system from Russia has arrived amidst the most significant crisis in the history of U.S.-Turkish relations. The purchase has not only spurred a further deterioration of these relations but has also changed the fundamental structural dynamics of the crisis so as to make impossible a return to the status quo ante. Despite the fact that the S-400 deal had been in the works for two years, the delivery of the weapon system this past July appears to have caught American policymakers genuinely by surprise, but it should not have. Moments of close and even enthusiastic cooperation between Ankara and Washington over the past decade and a half have acted as so much dust in the eyes, obscuring the reality that, since the end of the Cold War, U.S.-Turkish relations have been on an overall downward slope. Yet, today, incredulous American policymakers cling to the notion that Turkey is akin to a wayward child who, after throwing an emotionally gratifying tantrum, will have no choice but to come to his senses and resume behaving properly, in this case supporting the American-led global order. The inability of those in Washington to grasp the causes of the crisis has prevented them from comprehending its potential consequences for American foreign policy.\nThe current crisis is not rooted in the whims of an autocratic, anti-Western, and Islamist Recep Tayyip Erdogan. To the contrary, the purchase of the S-400s reflects the fulfillment and manifestation of long-standing Turkish foreign policy aspirations and, what is more troubling for Washington, a marked decline in U.S. authority and power around the globe. In 2003, the United States embarked on a project to transform the greater Middle East in its favor. That project has not only failed to secure a more liberal, prosperous, and stable Middle East, it has also alienated Turkey, a lynchpin of America’s Middle East, Eastern European, and Eurasian policies. The larger meaning of the S-400 crisis is that Washington has to reconsider all these policies, not just its relationship with Ankara.\nTurkey’s Relationship with Russia\nA source of American disbelief about Turkey’s readiness to buy arms from Russia has been the assumption that Turkey and Russia are fated by geography, history, and culture to be adversaries. The idea that the two countries could be partners or even allies seemed unthinkable. It is true that a long-running and bloody rivalry between the Ottoman and Russian empires — the two have fought some 12 wars with each other — left indelible marks on the cultural and historical memories of both. Yet, there have been significant episodes of cooperation. Russia backed Istanbul in 1832–33, when Mehmed Ali of Egypt began advancing on Anatolia. Acting at the behest of the sultan, the tsar deployed Russian soldiers near Istanbul to deter any attack on the Ottoman capital, and thereby helped preserve the empire. The tsar subsequently converted that deployment into a treaty alliance that lasted almost a decade. Even on the eve of the most epic Ottoman-Russian conflict, World War I, the Ottomans established a Turkish-Russian Friendship Committee in March 1914, and in May 1914 pitched the idea of an alliance to the Russians. Historical grievances did not define Ottoman foreign policy toward Russia.\nThe most relevant instance of Russian-Turkish collaboration came during the Turkish War of National Independence (1919–22), when the Russians provided essential financial and military aid to the Turks. Even before he emerged to claim the mantle of the Turkish National Forces (Kuva-yi Milliye) in May, 1919, Mustafa Kemal engaged representatives of the Bolsheviks to discuss a possible alliance. Upon taking command of the nationalist movement, he promptly followed through to form an alliance with Vladimir Lenin and Bolshevik Russia. Soviet Russia subsequently delivered to Kemal and his forces both arms and funds. Kemal’s outreach to Lenin was a geopolitical masterstroke, but hardly a Machiavellian or even particularly clever one. It was neither a betrayal nor compromise of the Turkish Nationalist program, nor even controversial. Indeed, Kemal’s rivals either made their own overtures to the Bolsheviks or backed his.\nThe Turkish alliance with Soviet Russia against Britain, France, and the other imperial powers reflected Kemal’s insistence on uncompromised sovereignty and “total independence.” These were the fundamental principles of the nationalists who were determined to erect a self-standing nation-state out of the rubble of an empire. The gold and guns that Soviet Russia supplied enabled the Turks to prevail militarily in Anatolia and defy the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres, by which the victors of World War I agreed to partition Anatolia between Britain, France, Italy, Greece, and Armenia and leave a rump Turkish sultanate in the north of Anatolia and a potential Kurdish state in the southeast.\nKemal’s crowning success was the military victories that rendered the Treaty of Sèvres null and void and made the founding of the Turkish Republic possible. The Turkish Republic would likely not exist had the Soviets not backed him. Kemal had no interest in Bolshevism as a form of social organization, and indeed suppressed the nascent Turkish Communist Party. But he did grasp the Soviets’ potential as geopolitical allies. Soviet aid in the form of money, arms, and ammunition was critical to his success in the War of Independence. Indeed, so important was that aid that, in 1928, Kemal personally ordered that the monument to commemorate the victory of his forces also depict the first Soviet ambassador to Turkey, Sergei Aralov. Known as the Republic Monument, it stands today in Istanbul’s Taksim Square. The new Turkish Republic and the Soviet Union would enjoy sympathetic relations into the 1930s.\nStalin’s territorial and other demands on Turkey at the end of World War II pushed the Turks decisively toward the West and into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which it joined in 1952. For the next five decades, Turkey would maintain a pro-Western orientation. Yet, even during the Cold War, Turkey found a sometimes sympathetic audience in Moscow. A thaw in relations between Turkey and the Soviet Union in the early 1970s, for example, facilitated the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. Greece, in response, withdrew from NATO military command. The prospect of NATO members Greece and Turkey coming to blows undoubtedly thrilled the Politburo.\nThe End of the Cold War and Turkey’s Reorientation\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union fundamentally transformed Turkey’s geopolitical situation. The greatest threat to Turkey’s security had dissolved and for the first time in centuries Turkey no longer shared a border with Russia — a number of buffer states now separated the two. In addition, the Russian Federation was one half the size and less capable than its Soviet predecessor.\nIronically, it was the Turks who initially worried that the end of the Cold War would imperil their relationship with the United States. There was a real fear in Ankara in the early 1990s that Washington would abandon Turkey now that it no longer needed a guard on NATO’s southern flank. Gradually, however, the Turks began to recognize that the end of bipolarity offered more, not less, room for diplomatic maneuvering. The deeper currents of Kemalism, namely the suspicion of all great powers and the aspiration for total independence, began to reassert themselves in the shaping of Turkish foreign policy.\nOne of the more striking examples of this reorientation came in March, 2002, when Gen. Tuncer Kılınç, secretary-general of the Turkish National Security Council, voiced his belief that Turkey should turn from the West and seek allies in Russia and Iran. Kılınç was not speaking as a private citizen, nor was he a loner. A significant portion of Turkey’s officer corps, then the self-appointed guardians of Kemalism, shared his distrust of the West, his belief that Turkey was overly dependent on the West, and his desire to diversify Turkey’s relations beyond the West.\nThe Kemalist worldview presents contemporary Turkey much like its late Ottoman predecessor — beset by predatory Great Powers intent on weakening it from within and without and ultimately partitioning it. This worldview has been inculcated in Turkish citizens through school, military service, and the media for over seven decades. It is very much hard-wired into Turkish memory. In its cruder manifestations, it is known as “Sèvres Syndrome,” a reference to the abortive Treaty of Sèvres of 1920.\nKemal blocked the Great Powers’ design for Anatolia and preserved Turkish sovereignty by working with Moscow. Ankara’s contemporary pivot to Moscow must be seen in a similar fashion. There is nothing mysterious or inscrutable about it. Sentiments of authoritarian solidarity, the default explanation for many American observers, have no more to do with it than they did with Kemal’s outreach to Lenin. American policies, and the Turkish sensitivities and fears that they arouse, are the primary drivers.\nThe future of Russo-Turkish ties will depend to a great deal, perhaps decisively, on the future of U.S.-Turkish relations. If the United States and Turkey remain allies — even troubled ones — Ankara is unlikely to deepen its ties with Russia beyond what it is doing now. The same aspirations for independence and uncontested sovereignty that push Turkey to distance itself from the United States will, especially when coupled with a historically informed wariness of Russia, work against Turkey becoming a close and enthusiastic partner of Russia. If, however, U.S.-Turkish relations grow still more confrontational, Ankara may deepen its relationship to Moscow. Moscow will seek to widen and exploit the rift between Washington and, ideally, exploit it so as to disrupt the internal dynamics of NATO.\nA Remarkable Rapprochement\nThe Turco-Russian rapprochement is all the more remarkable for having occurred in the wake of the most severe standoff between the two countries since the Cold War. In November 2015, the Turkish Air Force downed a Russian SU-24 attack aircraft that had violated Turkish airspace while it was flying combat missions against Turkish-supported militias in Syria fighting to overthrow Bashar al-Assad. Earlier that year, Moscow had deployed air and ground assets to Syria to bolster Assad’s wobbling regime, which was battling an array of opposition groups, including the Islamic State. The Syrian Civil War was of intense interest to Ankara. Not simply because it drove over two and a half million refugees into Turkey, but even more so because it opened the questions of Syria’s — and by extension Turkey’s — borders and territorial integrity. Like Turkey, Syria became a state after World War I — its borders are hardly time-honored. Indeed, Damascus has never recognized Ankara’s sovereignty over the region of Hatay, ceded by France to Turkey in 1939. Most alarming to Ankara, however, was the prospect that the Kurdistan Worker’s Party, in the form of its Syrian subsidiary, the Democratic Union Party, and its militia, the People’s Protection Units, would consolidate itself on Syrian territory. The Kurdistan Worker’s Party is far and away the Turkish Republic’s number one security threat. It has been battling the Turkish state for close to four decades. During the 1990s, it used Syria as a sanctuary from which to wage insurgency inside Turkey. That insurgency is ongoing and has claimed some 40,000 lives. When the besieged Syrian government withdrew its forces from northeast Syria, Syrian Kurds led by the Democratic Union Party established a de facto autonomous government there. The achievement of autonomy, and perhaps eventually independence in the event of Syria’s break-up, would boost the Kurdistan Worker’s Party by allowing it to demonstrate a capacity to administer territory.\nAnkara’s preferred solution to the Syrian Civil War was the overthrow of Assad. When President Barack Obama loudly declared in August 2011 that Assad must step aside, Ankara, like the rest of the world, interpreted this as an American commitment to seeing Assad toppled. Thereupon, Turkey, both in cooperation with, and parallel to, the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, began backing Syrian opposition groups in a bid to bring down the Assad regime.\nAssad, however, proved tenacious. Obama remained unwilling to intervene directly, even after declaring ominously in 2012 that Damascus had crossed a “red line” when it employed chemical weapons, and after the extensive American covert effort to train and arm Assad opponents proved stillborn. The impotence raised doubts among the Turks about the commitment and staying power of the United States. The metastasis of the so-called Islamic State inside Syria further complicated matters. In 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin moved to bolster the Syrian government by deploying air elements and supporting ground units to Syria, and in September of that year, those forces commenced military operations. Predictions from Washington of Russian overextension and folly proved badly mistaken. Russian air support, coupled with the presence of ground forces from Iran and Hezbollah, turned the tide decisively in favor of the Syrian government. The Russian air force attacked Turkish-backed militias with special gusto and Turkey and Russia thus found themselves engaged in a proxy war.\nThat proxy war could have flared into a real one when the Turkish F-16 intercepted and shot down the Russian SU-24. The Turks unquestionably acted boldly, and, as it turned out, recklessly. If the Turks’ calculation was that the threat of an armed clash with a NATO member would cause the Russians to pull the throttle back on their operations inside Syria, they misfired entirely. Putin refrained from military escalation but vowed sternly that Turkey would pay a price for what he angrily termed “a stab in the back” from “the accomplices of terrorists.” Turkey’s economic dependence on Russia, particularly in the spheres of energy, tourism, and agriculture, represented a vulnerability. Russia accordingly imposed a range of retaliatory economic measures.\nHowever foolhardy the downing of the Russian jet may have been, Washington’s cool attitude toward Ankara in its wake signaled that Turkey would be on its own in managing Russia. Similarly, the Obama’s administration’s incoherent diffidence in Syria — blending noisy rhetoric against Assad, massive albeit ineffective covert support for the armed opposition, and an abashed but firm refusal to intervene directly — left Turkey in a lurch. Ankara’s support for anti-Assad rebels, including a motley assortment of jihadists, had been no more successful than Washington’s. And with Russia having demonstrated that it was in the driver’s seat in Syria, Ankara calculated that it had better work with Moscow or face a severe and chronic threat from Syria. Less than a year later, in a stunning turnaround, Erdogan formally apologized for shooting down the jet, and even offered compensation to the family of the Russian pilot who died. Turkey endorsed and began participating in the Russian-sponsored negotiations on Syria in Astana, Kazakhstan. The story of how Putin bent Erdogan to his will is remarkable and would make an excellent case study in coercive diplomacy.\nErdogan’s 180-degree turn from being Putin’s defiant opponent to his supplicant did not come without blowback. Just as the Astana talks were to begin in December 2016, an off-duty Turkish police officer gunned down the Russian ambassador to Turkey in a macabre assassination in an art exhibit in Ankara. The provocation, however, failed to shake either Ankara’s or Moscow’s determination to put aside their past differences.\nAmerica and the Kurds\nIf American irresolution in Syria and the failure of its own misadventures there left Turkey feeling exposed and vulnerable to Russian power, America’s collaboration with the People’s Protection Units caused Ankara to conclude that it had been betrayed and thus might now even need Russian power. The 2014 decision of the Obama administration to train and arm the Kurdish militia in Syria created, in the words of then-deputy assistant secretary of state for Southern European and Eastern Mediterranean Affairs, a “ticking time bomb” in U.S.-Turkish relations. The “strategic contradiction” of arming the greatest enemy of a treaty ally created “foreseeable consequences that are now on painful display.” Foremost among those foreseeable consequences was the alienation of Turkey from the United States and the former’s rapprochement with Russia.\nAdding insult to injury was the coyness of American officials, who knew that the People’s Protection Units was a subsidiary of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party but attempted to obfuscate this fact by pushing the Syrian Kurdish group to change its name. The commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command, Gen. Raymond Thomas, acknowledged in public that U.S. officials had asked the group to “rebrand” itself for the sake of camouflaging its status as a Kurdistan Workers’ Party militia. In response, the People’s Protection Units adopted the name, “Syrian Democratic Forces.” The change in name fooled no one, least of all the Turks. Then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter testified in 2016 before the Senate that the People’s Protection Units was tied to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party. The Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats openly affirmed in the 2018 Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community that the People’s Protection Units is the “Syrian militia of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).”\nAside from an overt invasion, there is nothing that could be more inflammatory to the Turkish national security establishment and public alike than collaboration with the Kurdish separatist group and its subsidiaries. It triggers the Sèvres Syndrome. The fundamental goal of the Kemalists in founding the Republic of Turkey was to forge out of the disparate Muslim communities of Anatolia an indivisible nation, unified as a single whole and loyal to the state, and thereby impervious to the fracture and partition that brought down the Ottoman empire. The belief that outside powers are intent on using Kurdish nationalism to subvert and break up Turkey from within has haunted the Turkish Republic from its very beginning. Experience, not delusion, instilled that belief in Kemal and the other founders of the republic. Imperial Russia had been fostering Kurdish revolts inside Ottoman Anatolia in the years directly preceding World War I, and in the years after the war, British officials explored ways to use the Kurds to undermine Kemal and the republic. The Soviet Union supported Kurdish separatism in various ways throughout the Cold War, and Russia did the same in the 1990s. Indeed, such support was a major factor cementing U.S.-Turkish relations during those years. The vast majority of Turks hold the Kurdistan Workers’ Party and the People’s Protection Units responsible for countless suicide bombings and terror campaigns inside Turkey. Once America began collaborating with Kurdish separatists, Turkish alienation from America was inevitable.\nThe recent withdrawal of U.S. forces from northern Syria and the cessation of American support for the People’s Protection Units has removed a major point of contention between Washington and Ankara. Yet, the precipitous nature of the withdrawal and Washington’s harsh criticism of the ensuing Turkish operation and its threats of economic warfare and sanctions have generated their own problems. Although President Donald Trump had repeatedly declared his intent to withdraw from Syria, his own staff stubbornly refused to prepare for it. As one analyst warned in April of 2018, “It is time for his [Trump’s] national security staff to listen to him and to devise a sequential drawdown policy that fits with the spirit of the president’s demands, but takes deliberate and uncomfortable steps to protect U.S. interests.” As predicted, the failure to do that has led to a debacle. Although U.S. forces were not overrun or formally humiliated, the evident lack of planning in their withdrawal has revealed disorder and disorientation in American policy. Trump’s subsequent declaration that he is “fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey’s economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path,” has reinforced the appearance of confusion while simultaneously offending Turks across the board and lending Erdogan cover against criticism that he has mismanaged the struggling Turkish economy.\nThe American pullout was surely a disappointment to the People’s Protection Units, but it should not have been a surprise. Predictably, the Kurdish militia responded to the Turkish invasion by choosing to turn to the Syrian government, which, with Russian backing, can now easily deter the Turkish army. The status of the Syrian Kurdish group and the question of Kurdish autonomy inside Syria remains to be negotiated. Although not a disaster for the People’s Protection Units, this turn of events has certainly disrupted the goal of laying the groundwork for a sovereign state. While Turkey’s operation in northern Syria has likely fulfilled its primary objective, the damage it has done to relations with the United States leaves Ankara vulnerable to pressure from Moscow, given Russia’s position inside Syria and its other sources of leverage over Turkey.\nAmerican Support for Fethullah Gülen\nAlthough it is virtually impossible to think of a more inflammatory act than working with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, America’s curious sympathy for the guru-like Turkish religious figure, Fethullah Gülen, would make an excellent candidate. Gülen, who has a long and demonstrated track record of attempting to subvert the Turkish Republic by helping his followers infiltrate Turkish bureaucracies, in particular, the armed services and police, has been residing in the United States since fleeing arrest in Turkey in 1999. Although in 2008 the Department of Homeland Security rejected Gülen’s application for residence as duplicitous, an appeal on Gülen’s behalf led by American diplomatic and intelligence officials resulted in Gülen being permitted to reside in the United States. Despite the fact that Gülen’s followers in America were subsequently revealed to be engaged in systematic fraud of American taxpayers in multiple states, as well as in a number of far more serious illegal efforts inside Turkey, as attested by credible government critics and supporters alike, Gülen continued not just to reside in the country, but even to retain access to prime media outlets like the New York Times and Washington Post.\nThere is a great deal that is unknown about the failed coup of July 2016. Turkey’s own government could have done — and could still do — a better job providing a recounting of events. But there can be no doubt that the putschists were deadly serious about overthrowing Erdogan and his government. The violence, which resulted in the deaths of over 300 people, vastly exceeded that of earlier coups and attempted coups in Turkey. Although the precise role that Gülen played is unknown, the contention that he was not involved is implausible. Incontrovertible evidence exists that demonstrates that some of Gülen’s longest serving and closest disciples played leading operational roles in the coup. American and European support for the target of the coup, the Turkish government, was noticeably tepid. Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt lamented the lack of support, and then warned that it would be “a disgrace for Europe” if Putin became the first leader to meet with Erdogan after the coup. This is exactly what happened when Putin received Erdogan in St. Petersburg on Aug. 9, 2016, underscoring the message that Russia was more reliable than the United States or any Western European state.\nProviding residency to Gülen is deeply provocative to the Turkish public as a whole, not just to Erdogan’s government. Gülen is one of the most reviled men in Turkey. Opposition to him spans the spectrum of Turkish opinion. Indeed, criticism of Gülen and U.S. support for him is more deeply rooted in Erdogan’s secularist critics than his followers. As is the case with its relationship with the People’s Protection Units, America’s dalliance with Gülen has increased Turkish wariness of the United States in all corners of the country. As Ambassador James Jeffrey has remarked, Gülen’s presence in America is “embarrassing.” Given the facts above, it is no surprise that over 80 percent of Turks view the United States as a threat.\nConclusion\nThe first shipment of S-400 missiles arrived in Turkey this July, on the three-year anniversary of the failed coup. The timing was deliberate, and celebratory media coverage further reinforced the symbolic importance. Erdogan declared the purchase “the most significant agreement in our history,” a hyperbolic statement to be sure, but not a meaningless one. In fact, the meaning is quite clear: The Republic of Turkey, which for decades had been a steadfast, if sometimes disgruntled, ally of the United States and the West more generally, now prefers to distance itself from the West for the sake of its own security. Although bold and risky, the purchase of the S-400 and the broader turn to Russia cannot be ascribed primarily to Erdogan’s supposed erraticism, still less to his Islamist orientation or any ideology aside from mainstream Turkish nationalism. The turn to Russia is in keeping with fundamental tenets of the foreign policy laid down by Mustafa Kemal, and, as argued above, in fact has its precedent in Kemal’s personal diplomacy.\nAnd just as Kemal turned to Russia to seek support against Western, particularly British, threats, so today the dangers that Ankara perceives coming from the United States drive what is, on the one hand, a stunning rapprochement between Ankara and Moscow and, on the other, a rebuke to Washington. That the Turks have done their share of damage to the U.S.-Turkish relationship goes without saying, and the dangers that they perceive from America are exaggerated. Moreover, Erdogan’s chronic rancor toward Europe has left Turkey further isolated, and thus vulnerable to Russian power. But the inability, or unwillingness, of American policymakers to craft policies that take into account the fundamental security concerns and sensitivities of a country that has, for decades, been a key partner of the United States in the Middle East, the Balkans, the Black Sea, the Caucasus, and Eurasia must be central to any explanation of the current turn in Turkish-Russian relations. The mutual willingness of Washington and Ankara to rebuild their ties will be the key determinant of the future of the Turkish-Russian relationship. Turkey, Russia, and even the United States in the coming years will all be vulnerable to domestic turbulence and each inevitably will encounter crises in their foreign relations. Many things can change. As this piece goes to press and U.S.-Turkish relations continue to deteriorate, however, one can only expect that the trajectory of Turkish-Russian relations will continue in a positive direction.\nMichael A.

Instead, Wilson said, O’Malley would only do so “if it was determined by the US military that it was appropriate to up the arms to the Kurds”.\nO’Malley, who in polls of the Democratic field for 2016 is some way behind frontrunner Hillary Clinton and second-place Bernie Sanders, has rarely deviated significantly from the Obama administration on foreign policy. His initial reaction to the Iran nuclear deal, for example, was relatively positive.\nO’Malley told reporters on Tuesday: “I still haven’t reviewed the agreement, but I am of the belief that a negotiated agreement, provided it’s verifiable and enforceable, is the best path to a nuclear-free Iran. So I think that the initial news is promising.”\nIn response to a question from the Guardian on Thursday, O’Malley refused to follow some opponents of the deal and criticize the White House for leaving four Americans held captive in Iran.\n“I understand why the president and his negotiating team in their judgment would want to have their negotiations concluded which were complicated enough in a siloed basis,” O’Malley said.\nHe added: “I think all of us are right to demand that our government continue to advocate for the release of those Americans in Iran.”\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Such runaway inequality is bad for all of us, but it’s the poorest among us who suffer the most.\nOur latest research report published in January ahead of the annual gathering of the world’s financial and political elites in Davos, outlines how the wealth of the poorest half of the world’s population continues to fall, while the wealth of the richest grows. Extreme inequality is the result of a skewed economic and political system that favors the few at the expense of everyone else. And although there’s been a lot of talk about the issue over the last couple of years, there’s been little action to tackle it.\n“Power and privilege are being used to rig the system to increase the gap between the richest and the rest of us to levels we have not seen before,” said Raymond C. Offenheiser, President of Oxfam America. “Far from trickling down, income and wealth are instead being pulled upwards at an alarming rate.”\nHardworking people at the bottom of the income curve don’t make enough to put food on the table or buy medicine when their kids get sick, much less money to buy a home, start a business or save for the future. And so the engine of economic growth breaks down.\nA year ago, Oxfam predicted that the 1% would soon own more than the rest of us, a prediction that came true even before 2015 ended.\nTax havens are at the core of the global system that allows large corporations and wealthy individuals to avoid paying their fair share, depriving governments, rich and poor, of the resources they need to provide vital public services and tackle rising inequality.\nGlobally, it is estimated that a total of $7.6 trillion of personal wealth sits offshore. If tax would be paid on the income that this wealth generates, an extra $190 billion would be available to governments every year. Such tax revenues could pay for public services, infrastructure, regulatory bodies, welfare systems and other goods and services that keep countries running.\nIn developing countries in particular, where there is an even bigger need for strengthening health and education services for the hundreds of millions of people who still live in extreme poverty, revenues from taxes could make such a difference. But when money is hidden in tax havens instead, this can work in reverse, shifting the burden on the poorest people.\nWe can do better than this.\nWe can build a better world. A world where there is decent work for all, where women and men are treated equally, where tax havens are something people read about in the history books, and where everyone pays their fair share to support a society that benefits everyone. Practical, smart reforms can level the playing field, making the system work better for all of us. We can start with ending the era of tax havens.\nTell Congress that it’s time to end unfair tax havens and make corporations and financial institutions pay their fair share of taxes.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Eight men own the same wealth as the 3.6 billion people who make up the poorest half of humanity, according to a new report published by Oxfam today to mark the annual meeting of political and business leaders in Davos.\nOxfam’s report, ‘An economy for the 99 percent’, shows that the gap between rich and poor is far greater than had been feared. It details how big business and the super-rich are fuelling the inequality crisis by dodging taxes, driving down wages and using their power to influence politics. It calls for a fundamental change in the way we manage our economies so that they work for all people, and not just a fortunate few.\nNew and better data on the distribution of global wealth – particularly in India and China – indicates that the poorest half of the world has less wealth than had been previously thought. Had this new data been available last year, it would have shown that nine billionaires owned the same wealth as the poorest half of the planet, and not 62, as Oxfam calculated at the time.\nWinnie Byanyima, Executive Director of Oxfam International, said:\n“It is obscene for so much wealth to be held in the hands of so few when 1 in 10 people survive on less than $2 a day. Inequality is trapping hundreds of millions in poverty; it is fracturing our societies and undermining democracy.\n“Across the world, people are being left behind. Their wages are stagnating yet corporate bosses take home million dollar bonuses; their health and education services are cut while corporations and the super-rich dodge their taxes; their voices are ignored as governments sing to the tune of big business and a wealthy elite.”\nOxfam’s report shows how our broken economies are funnelling wealth to a rich elite at the expense of the poorest in society, the majority of whom are women. The richest are accumulating wealth at such an astonishing rate that the world could see its first trillionaire in just 25 years. To put this figure in perspective – you would need to spend $1 million every day for 2738 years to spend $1 trillion.\nPublic anger with inequality is already creating political shockwaves across the globe. Inequality has been cited as a significant factor in the election of Donald Trump in the US, the election of President Duterte in the Philippines, and Brexit in the UK.\nSeven out of 10 people live in a country that has seen a rise in inequality in the last 30 years. Between 1988 and 2011 the incomes of the poorest 10 percent increased by just $65 per person, while the incomes of the richest 1 percent grew by $11,800 per person – 182 times as much.\nWomen, who are often employed in low pay sectors, face high levels of discrimination in the work place, and who take on a disproportionate amount of unpaid care work often find themselves at the bottom of the pile. On current trends it will take 170 years for women to be paid the same as men.\n‘An Economy for the 99 percent’ also reveals how big business and the super-rich are fuelling the inequality crisis. It shows how, in order to maximize returns to their wealthy shareholders, big corporations are dodging taxes, driving down wages for their workers and the prices paid to producers, and investing less in their business.\nOxfam interviewed women working in a garment factory in Vietnam who work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week and still struggle to get by on the $1 an hour they earn producing clothes for some of the world’s biggest fashion brands. The CEOs of these companies are some of the highest paid people in the world. Corporate tax dodging costs poor countries at least $100 billion every year. This is enough money to provide an education for the 124 million children who aren’t in school and fund healthcare interventions that could prevent the deaths of at least six million children every year.\nThe report outlines how the super-rich use a network of tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of tax and an army of wealth managers to secure returns on their investments that would not be available to ordinary savers. Contrary to popular belief, many of the super-rich are not ‘self-made’. Oxfam analysis shows over half the world’s billionaires either inherited their wealth or accumulated it through industries which are prone to corruption and cronyism.\nIt also demonstrates how big business and the super-rich use their money and connections to ensure government policy works for them. For example, billionaires in Brazil have sought to influence elections and successfully lobbied for a reduction in tax bills while oil corporations in Nigeria have managed to secure generous tax breaks.\nByanyima said: “The millions of people who have been left behind by our broken economies need solutions, not scapegoats. That is why Oxfam is setting out a new common sense approach to managing our economies so that they work for the majority and not just the fortunate few.”\n“Governments are not helpless in the face of technological change and market forces. If politicians stop obsessing with GDP, and focus on delivering for all their citizens and not just a wealthy few, a better future is possible for everyone.”\nOxfam’s blueprint for a more human economy includes:\nGovernments end the extreme concentration of wealth to end poverty. Governments should increase taxes on both wealth and high incomes to ensure a more level playing field, and to generate funds needed to invest in healthcare, education and job creation.\nGovernments cooperate rather than just compete. Governments should work together to ensure workers are paid a decent wage, and to put a stop to tax dodging and the race to the bottom on corporate tax.\nGovernments support companies that benefit their workers and society rather than just their shareholders. The multi-billion Euro company Mondragon, is owned by its 74,000 strong workforce. All employees receive a decent wage because its pay structure ensures that the highest paid member of staff earns no more than 9 times the amount of the lowest paid.\nGovernments ensure economies work for women. They must help to dismantle the barriers to women’s economic progress such as access to education and the unfair burden of unpaid care work.\nOxfam is also calling on business leaders to play their part in building a human economy. The World Economic Forum has responsive and responsible leadership as its key theme this year.

ABC Fact Check investigates.\nThe verdict\nOxfam's claim is in the ballpark.\nIts calculations on the wealth of the richest and poorest people in the world accurately reflect its original sources, the Global Wealth Databook, and the Forbes billionaires list.\nThe experts Fact Check consulted said that the data Oxfam had used was the best available, despite inherent limitations.\nHowever, the experts said the data was not robust enough to make conclusions about the change in wealth inequality over time.\nEstimating global wealth\nOxfam calculated the wealth of the bottom half of the world's population from the 2015 edition of the annual Global Wealth Databook published by financial services company Credit Suisse.\nThe Credit Suisse report says that the total global wealth in 2015 was $US250.145 trillion, which belonged to 4.77 billion adults.\nThe report also calculated how this sum was spread across 10 wealth categories.\nOxfam used this data to calculate that the first five categories, the poorest 50 per cent of the world's adults, owned 0.7 per cent of global wealth.\nThe Oxfam report considers that the wealth of this bottom 50 per cent belongs not only to poor adults, but to the poorest half of the world's total population including children.\nA spokesman for Oxfam told Fact Check the total population gave a fairer picture of the number of people relying on the wealth of the poorest 50 per cent of adults.\nThe Oxfam spokesman said it was safe to assume that the total wealth of the poorest half of the children in the world is negligible, but the same assumption could not safely be made of any dependents of the 62 wealthiest individuals.\nOn this basis, Oxfam said that global wealth was shared among 7.26 billion people, the total global population calculated by Credit Suisse.\nThe bottom half, the poorest 3.6 billion people, shared 0.7 per cent of $US250.145 trillion in global wealth, amounting to $US1.75 trillion.\nGlobal wealth by country\nCredit Suisse calculates global wealth by working out the average wealth of each country using household balance sheets and household survey data.\nIt calculates Australia's national wealth, for example, using the National Accounts and the Survey of Income and Housing published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nChris Doucouliagos, chair in economics at Deakin University, said the Credit Suisse reports on global wealth were \"highly respectable and their data on wealth is reliable\".\nPeter Whiteford, a professor specialising in social policy from the Crawford School of Public Policy at ANU, told Fact Check the Credit Suisse reports were very high quality and \"probably the best source available for such an analysis\".\nHowever, the experts Fact Check spoke to also said the global wealth analysis, as acknowledged by Credit Suisse and Oxfam, is imperfect.\nShortcomings of the data include incomplete or absent data sets and surveys from some countries, with data quality for only 17 countries rated \"good\".\nThe indebted wealthy\nOne of the aspects of Credit Suisse's global wealth calculation that can distort the data is that individual wealth is defined as net worth, which includes the value of financial assets like savings and shares, added to non-financial assets like housing and land, with any debt subtracted.\nThe Credit Suisse report shows that the poorest 10 per cent of people in the world have negative wealth.\nJustin Wolfers, a visiting professor of economics at the University of Sydney, told Fact Check it was not unreasonable to subtract debt.\n\"[But] they (Oxfam) are playing a game when they say 62 people have as much wealth as the bottom half of the world,\" he said.\n\"My three-year-old son has as much wealth as the bottom tenth of the world because he has no debt.\"\nOxfam in its report did acknowledge that some of the poorest 10 per cent of the world live in rich countries and would not be considered poor.\n\"Think graduates with large debts but large incomes, for example,\" its methodology paper notes.\nBut it defended its main finding by showing that excluding the bottom ten per cent in debt makes little difference — the top one per cent of the richest people own 49.8 per cent of the world's wealth, compared with 50.1 per cent when those in net debt are included.\nWho are the ultra-rich?\nOxfam compared the wealth of bottom half of the world's people, who own $US1.75 trillion, with the world's very rich using a list of the world's billionaires published by media company Forbes, which Professor Wolfers told Fact Check was the best data to look at the richest handful of people in the world.\nThe analysis shows that the top 62 richest billionaires owned $US1.762 trillion in 2015, with software billionaire Bill Gates topping the list with a net worth of $US79.2 billion.\nLucas Chancel, co-ordinator of the World Inequity Report at the Paris School of Economics, told Fact Check in an email that the key issue with wealth distributional data from household surveys was that it tended to underestimate the top end of the distribution.\nThe Credit Suisse report acknowledges that national wealth distribution data does not give an accurate picture of wealth at the top of the tail.\nThis is because wealthy households often do not participate in wealth surveys and when they do, tend to under-report their financial assets.\nTo compensate, Credit Suisse includes Forbes billionaires data, though it recognises that this data source has limited information on non-financial assets and personal debts.\nConcentration of wealth over time\nOxfam claims that the number of billionaires who own the same wealth as the bottom half of the world has contracted from 388 individuals in 2010 to 62 in 2015.\nFrench economist Thomas Piketty, author of the book \"Capital in the twenty-first century\" told Fact Check in an email that the orders of magnitude between the ultra rich and bottom 50 per cent calculated by Oxfam were \"probably about right\".\n\"But the data sources and methods are certainly insufficient to be very precise about the exact trend,\" he said.\nMr Chancel, who works with Professor Piketty at the Paris School of Economics, said income and wealth surveys and statistical interpolation methods applied in the Credit Suisse analysis \"mean that any comparison between one year and the other can be hazardous\".\n\"In particular, in several countries, wealth distribution surveys are not produced annually, making it insufficient to be precise on exact trends,\" he said.\nThis is the case with the Australian wealth distribution data for 2015, which comes from the 2010 Survey of Income and Housing, though the Credit Suisse report explains that this is partly compensated for by using the most recent house price growth, market capitalisation and GDP per capita growth.\nProfessor Wolfers said that changes from year to year could be purely due to exchange rate movements.\nThe Credit Suisse analysis uses current exchange rates for each country and converts them to US dollars.\n\"So if the US dollar gets stronger and a lot of these billionaires are in the US, it makes it look as if the Americans got richer, even though nothing has changed in their quality of life,\" Professor Wolfers said, \"which tells us nothing about the concentration of wealth, it just tells us that the US dollar is incredibly strong.\"\nThe Oxfam methodology report notes that \"any changes in values year to year in the data are nominal changes and must be analysed accordingly\".\nSources\nHelen Szoke, ABC Radio, January 18, 2016\nCredit Suisse research institute, Global wealth databook 2015, October 2015\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

The information here may be outdated and links may no longer function. Please contact webmaster@usdoj.gov if you have any questions about the archive site.\nAttorney General Merrick B. Garland announced today that the Department of Justice has opened a pattern or practice investigation into the Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government (Louisville Metro) and the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD). The investigation will assess all types of force used by LMPD officers, including use of force on individuals with behavioral health disabilities or individuals engaged in activities protected by the First Amendment. The investigation will assess whether LMPD engages in discriminatory policing, and also whether it conducts unreasonable stops, searches, seizures, and arrests, both during patrol activities and in obtaining and executing search warrants for private homes. The investigation will include a comprehensive review of LMPD policies, training, and supervision, as well as LMPD’s systems of accountability, including misconduct complaint intake, investigation, review, disposition, and discipline.\n“There are approximately 18,000 federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in this country. In each one, dedicated officers put themselves in harm’s way to protect others,” said Attorney General Garland. “Promoting public trust between communities and law enforcement is essential to making both communities and policing safer. Our enforcement efforts, as well as our grant-making and other support, will contribute to achieving that end and to protecting the civil rights of everyone in our country.”\nDepartment of Justice officials informed Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, LMPD Chief Erika Shields, County Attorney Mike O’Connell, and Louisville Metro Council President David James of the investigation. As part of this investigation, the Department of Justice will reach out to community groups and members of the public to learn about their experiences with LMPD.\n“The Constitution and federal law require law enforcement officers to treat all people fairly and equitably, regardless of race, disability, or participation in protected First Amendment activities,” said Pamela S. Karlan, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The investigation we are announcing today will examine whether these laws are being violated, while also analyzing the root causes of any violations we may find.”\nThe investigation is being conducted pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 which prohibits state and local governments from engaging in a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers that deprives individuals of rights protected by the Constitution or federal law. The Act allows the Department of Justice to remedy such misconduct through civil litigation. The department will be assessing law enforcement practices under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well as under the Safe Streets Act of 1968 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\nThe investigation will be led by the department’s Civil Rights Division and conducted by career attorneys and staff in the Civil Rights Division and in the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Kentucky. Individuals with relevant information are encouraged to contact the Department of Justice via email at Community.Louisville@usdoj.gov or by phone at 1-844-920-1460.

On average, Social Security retirement benefits will increase by about $56 per month starting in January.\nOver the last decade the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) increase has averaged about 3.1 percent. The COLA was 2.5 percent in 2025.\nNearly 71 million Social Security beneficiaries will see a 2.8 percent COLA beginning in January 2026. Increased payments to nearly 7.5 million people receiving SSI will begin on December 31, 2025. (Note: Some recipients receive both Social Security benefits and SSI).\n“Social Security is a promise kept, and the annual cost-of-living adjustment is one way we are working to make sure benefits reflect today’s economic realities and continue to provide a foundation of security,” said Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank J. Bisignano. “The cost-of-living adjustment is a vital part of how Social Security delivers on its mission.”\nSome other adjustments that take effect in January of each year are based on the increase in average wages. For example, the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax (taxable maximum) is slated to increase to $184,500 from $176,100.\nSocial Security begins notifying recipients about their new benefit amount by mail starting in early December. Those who have a personal my Social Security account can view their COLA notice online, which is secure, easy, and faster than receiving a letter in the mail. You can set up text or email alerts when a new message–such as your COLA notice–is available in your my Social Security account.\nYou will need to have a personal my Social Security account by November 19 to see your COLA notice online. To get started, visit www.ssa.gov/myaccount.\nInformation about Medicare changes for 2026 will be available at www.medicare.gov. For Social Security beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare, the 2026 benefit amount will be available via my Social Security’s Message Center starting in late November. Those who do not have an online my Social Security account will receive their COLA notice by mail in December.\nThe Social Security Act provides for how the COLA is calculated. The Social Security Act ties the annual COLA to the change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) as determined by the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.

IF IT WAS ONE OF US WE WOULD NEVER SEE THE OUTSIDE OF A JAIL AGAIN. 2 SETS OF RULES 1 FOR US AND NONE FOR THEM…\nJ E.\nIt’s impossible to live like this. Maybe it’s not worth trying. Pittance of COLA is eaten up by CMS increases.. ~$30 increase/mo was approx calculation of increase after removing BIG CMS hike. 2.8% NOPE! Pull out CMS hike: 1.6% for me?! [particularly hard to swallow when it’s over things like skin substitutes this year, few years back it was insanely expensive Rx for rare illness – yea, cost must be spread around I guess – why not have secondary coverage for these bazillion $ treatments for the FEW who have those conditions, use a sliding scale of their cost based on income & expenses for their fee for these insane treatments that DON’T apply 95%+?! You’ll bankrupt us ALL this way…]. And why not limit prices scam drug makers can charge for any CMS coverage??? ALL payors & providers would go out of business if they refused to take CMS patients entirely….. USE the leverage you have?!\nEVERY ‘developed’ nation has national healthcare with no copay for any appt, service or medicine! ALL those countries SET prices on drugs.. Still: no drugmaker refuses?! Clearly still profitable at $1-3 per unit… Yet our copay on the same drugs: $20-40 for us PLUS carriers pay whatever they supposedly pay. How does anyone rationalize that?! We pay over double for healthcare than anyone yet have worse outcomes?! That’s not ‘FREE MARKET’ that’s THIEVERY! Our govt allows itself & us to all be scammed while blaming us & or really stupid things many can see through! This insanity must end.\nInsult to injury: the pittance I can’t live on is TOO much to qualify for ‘extra help’ or government subsidies of all manner?!?! While we’ve just spent 1mo+ hearing how wasteful & how programs are so abused…?! Ever consider it’s all BROKEN?! Ironic humor: if I STOPPED choosing between drugs, food, supplies, co-pays = I EASILY qualify to be in a CARE FACILITY?! How much would that run ya, govt?! All as healthy young people make decisions NONE have had to live themselves?! All levels of society bark about ‘cost of living’. Well NEWSFLASH: calculate ‘cost to stay alive’ ON TOP OF your SAME cost of living bills – on a tiny FRACTION of working income….. Plus DISQUALIFIED from all help programs: then get back to me on how ‘hard’ it all is!!l\nUsing an inflation calculator & including COLAs: we’ve steadily LOST money & ‘purchasing power’ as many years back as I was able to go?! Now getting paid LESS than back in the 1980s, when adjusted for inflation?! Fastest growing impoverished people in the country… By definition these are the exact few populations who will have MORE expenses related to health, prescriptions, copays, purchasing things CMS refuses for arbitrary reasons [even if necessary to life in my latest instance], often special diets, mobility modifications to home or vehicle, mobility aids, outrageously priced EVERYTHING OTC for relevant needs [how do baby diapers cost X while adult PADS 1/10 the material or production cost 5x more?!] FREE Market is the come back. they say. Ah. Well. What happens to the economy when half of it cannot buy anything?! WHY are ANY healthcare organizations, health insurance companies & any adjacent entities allowed to be FOR PROFIT?!?! Posting countless billions in profit while insisting to us & govt ‘costs are just rising’ – WHY don’t your own finances reflect that then?! WHY does no fool ever say so?! Similarly, how can anyone be cool with tax exempt entities of any kind with $1-$100 MILLION salaries for executives…..?! Want to keep social safety nets alive: reel that crap in & TAX those entities!! [including all that pseudo ‘religions’ given the same absurd luxury yet function as businesses & scams in EVERY way….?!\nCOLA isn’t even calculated same as REAL inflation #, even though we live in same economy?! Zero thought to CMS hike or what OUR expenses actually are [NOT the same as young healthy people! Double your inflation rate: you MIGHT get to what we must figure out affording!]… All done by people NOT nor have EVER been on SS or CMS?! Why not involve people who can tell you reality?! The lobbyists trying to bankrupt all of us & the nation AREN’T telling reality! Get the lobbyists OUT, cap salaries of ALL mgmt who want ‘non profit’ ‘tax exempt’ status (incld stock options)! Waste/fraud/abuse is 100% with payors & healthcare providers [as someone who’s been health professional AND patient!] – yet endless effort goes into investigating patients’ usually innocent ‘mistake’ IF it was even THEIR fault anyway…..?! It’s all demonic, absurd & crushing people.\nThe message to the ‘elderly’, disabled, survivors, etc is [in my opinion] is we’re a nuisance to the govt/society & easier to NOT have us around. It’s deflating, hurtful, not what I paid in for, not the fairy tale I’ve been sold my whole life about ‘who’ this country supposedly was or supposedly ‘stood for’. That type of was implemented before: 1930s Germany T4 & other similar programs to eliminate or reduce as much as possible the ‘burden’ on the ‘healthy’ ‘productive’ people…… In a history ignorant country with lobbyists paying to control things for the benefit of few at the cost of many: I’m scared to find out where bottom is. Sadly, the house of cards is bound to collapse completely the more the masses are weakened & hollowed out! The billions & trillions the top few won’t mean much WHEN their companies all go bankrupt without consumers in a CONSUMER driven economy! Private industries & govt KEEP eviscerating the masses… Without enough awareness how much it’ll COST THEM when the fat man sings! Such greed & ignorance [along with literally ALL the above] are UNIQUELY American. Pretty sad reflection……. If only they’d bother to LOOK! Ugh. Exhausting. Impossible. Futile.\nDella\nIt’s abusive …. believable we are actually paying the salaries of these people who are robbing us blind, sick and dead\nNora\nWell said\nBelinda\nYou are absolutely right.

On average, Social Security retirement benefits will increase by about $50 per month starting in January.\nOver the last decade the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) increase has averaged about 2.6%. The COLA was 3.2% in 2024.\nNearly 68 million Social Security beneficiaries will see a 2.5% COLA beginning in January 2025. Increased payments to nearly 7.5 million people receiving SSI will begin on December 31, 2024. (Note: Some people receive both Social Security benefits and SSI).\n“Social Security benefits and SSI payments will increase in 2025, helping tens of millions of people keep up with expenses even as inflation has started to cool,” said Martin O’Malley, Commissioner of Social Security.\nSome other adjustments that take effect in January of each year are based on the increase in average wages. Based on that increase, the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax (taxable maximum) is slated to increase to $176,100 from $168,600.\nSocial Security begins notifying people about their new benefit amount by mail starting in early December.\nThis year, for the first time, Social Security beneficiaries will receive a newly designed and improved COLA notice that makes it easier for customers to find the information they need most. The simplified COLA notice is now only one page, uses plain and personalized language, and provides exact dates and dollar amounts of a person’s new benefit amount and any deductions. Learn more on our video.\nIndividuals who have a personal my Social Security account can view their COLA notice online, which is secure, easy, and faster than receiving a letter in the mail. People can set up text or email alerts when there is a new message–such as their COLA notice–waiting for them in my Social Security.\nPeople will need to have a personal my Social Security account by Nov. 20 to see their COLA notice online. To get started, visit www.ssa.gov/myaccount.\nInformation about Medicare changes for 2025 will be available at www.medicare.gov. For Social Security beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare, the 2025 benefit amount will be available via my Social Security’s Message Center starting in late November. Those who have not opted to receive messages online will receive their COLA notice by mail in December.\nThe Social Security Act provides for how the COLA is calculated. The Social Security Act ties the annual COLA to the increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) as determined by the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nTo read more, please visit www.ssa.gov/cola.\nDid you find this Information helpful?\nTags: COLA, my Social Security\nSee CommentsAbout the Author\nComments\nComments are closed.\nJ. C.\nThe buying power of COLA Social Security payments is down 20% below 2010 payments. COLA increases have not kept up with the actual impact of inflation. Senior Citizens mostly buy groceries and pay rent, yet you include MANY expenses in the CPI (Consumer Price Index) that we don’t need nor do we purchase. How can we address this issue?\nPatricia V.\nGovernment pension is the worst type of income we worked for, yet many of us could not get pensions from private-sector employment and limited or no savings! We face financial problems with shrinking fixed income values while collecting with our benefits called Social Security, SSDI & SSDI as our only income. We feel punished because we must now live with a fixed income through no fault of our own.\nCherie P.\nWe were told by many sources about the COLA for this year, 2025. It is 2.5% or an average increase of $50 to the beneficiaries of which I am one. HOWEVER, why in the world did MY monthly check DECREASE? I called and was told Medicare increased our Part B premium to $185/month. OUCH. Seems like I could purchase my own private medical insurance for that kind of premium. Why didn’t my friends’ and neighbors’ checks decrease? Their Medicare premium is also (I am told) $185. Not only did I not qualify (???) for COLA but the monthly check I was already receiving decreased ALSO! I got hit TWO WAYS.\nAny ideas anyone that make sense?\nAlison W.\nI get $185.00 less $150.00 for Medicare leaving $35.00 SS income. Each time there is a COLA increase that amount of money goes to Medicare. My benefit remains $35.00.\nI worked for 40 plus quarters which qualified me for a small Soc. Sec. benefit. After I start public school teaching, I paid into that state’s pension for teachers. For many years in Texas I was not allowed to pay into Social Security. When the option was available, I turned it down as I was vested in the Tx Retirement System and would not get much of a return from SS. It makes no sense. I tried to figure out from information on Medicare site why this COLA always goes to Medicare. Maybe it is an AI glitch or some algorithm that was not properly set up. Write to your Senators and Congressmen.\nPatricia V.\nHello:\n2025 SSA rates increased 2.5%, but inflation increased 3 %. My benefits are not keeping up with general inflation. My housing costs alone increased about 5% last year, and may do the same in 2025, leaving my payments behind by over 2.5%. Already this year the payment increase has lost its value. The CPI index\nappears to be insufficient calculation.\nThank you.\nJared b.\nHi, I would like my social security check to get increased a little please.\nAngela L.\nYes I would love an desperately need it .

No one from Social Security is going to read this or contact you as they’d have zero clue how to just from you commenting on a post. I see you put your social security number on here for the whole world to see and possibly even use to steal your identity. Please take this doen or at least edit it and remove your social security number. I’d hate to see you get scammed and taken advantage or have your identity stolen because of this with everything else it seems you’re going through. You need to call the Socisl Security office in your state and tell them everything you’ve said here or even better to make an appointment and go in person. If I had a way to contact you I would help you create an online account where you could get the information you need from the last six years of your social security payments. It’s rather easy but I’m sure a representative from the social security office would walk you through it. I’m so sorry your having such a rough time and I will put you in my prayers ma’am. But PLEASE delete your social number from this post, please. There are unfortunately so many evil and deceitful people out here that would love to prey on you. Protect yourself in any way possible from it by starting with keeping your personal information private, don’t put it online like this and only give it to the people that you know you can trust with it. Be safe and you have my prayers ma’am.\nPatricia V.\nIs ride-share available in your area?\nPatricia V.\nDelete your Social Security # to protect your identity and call your local Social Security office.\nElizabeth W.\nThanks for always informing us, about our benefits status.

The TINY COLA increase started in January…by February, THAT amount was decreased on my SNAP benefits.\nSo, not only do I have to try & survive on SSI & food stamps, but can’t even afford average toiletries or television (which i literally need to survive, being permanently disabled), because i already have to pay for some\nfood out of my SSI.\nNo matter how grateful, I am struggling to survive.\nI’d be on SSDI but I was in a nursing home, after my 5th (emergency) spinal surgery (as a single mother of two)… and missed my ‘10 year work deadline’ (was a stay @ home mom, while we were married) by days because of that.

There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience.

To achieve this, accurate and timely information about this Some College, No Credential (SCNC) population, and their re-enrollment in and progress through higher education, is essential. Our annual progress report series, developed with the support of Lumina Foundation, sheds light on these critical factors.\nThe Some College, No Credential (SCNC) report series seeks to understand the educational trajectories of SCNC individuals. Reports in this series identify the levels of opportunity within each state for re-engaging SCNC students in the postsecondary attainment pipeline by tracking the following SCNC student outcomes annually: re-enrollment after stopout, completion of a first credential, and perseverance as indicated by continuing enrollment into a second academic year. State and institutional leaders can leverage this data to inform strategies for bringing SCNC students back into higher education.\nBelow, you can download the full report (PDF), as well as access the data dashboard, which provides national and state data for the latest year. You can also access our two data appendices: The National Demographics and State Data Appendix (xlsx) contains a demographic overview of the national SCNC population as well as detailed data on state SCNC populations and outcomes (re-enrollment, first credential, perseverance). The National Outcomes Data Appendix (Tableau) provides detailed data on SCNC outcomes at the national level.\nHighlights\n- The SCNC population is 43.1 million as of the start of the 2023-24 academic year. The working age SCNC population currently under 65 comprises 37.6 million people, an increase of 2.2 percent from the start of the prior academic year.\n- The number of students stopping out from higher education declined for the second year in a row, and the number of SCNC students re-enrolling in postsecondary education increased for the second year in a row. However, the SCNC population still grew as the 2.1 million students who were newly stopped out between January 2022 and July 2023 far outpaced SCNC re-enrollment in the 2022-23 academic year and the number of individuals aging out of the working age SCNC population.\n- All institution sectors saw fewer stopouts between January 2022 and July 2023 compared to the same period starting a year prior, except for private for-profit four-year institutions and primarily online institutions.\n- All states saw increases in the size of their SCNC populations, while 42 states and the District of Columbia saw increases in SCNC re-enrollment in 2023-24 compared to the previous year.\n- Nationally, the share of re-enrollees earning a credential in their first year of re-enrollment ticked up to 4.7 percent (+0.3pp).\n- Despite persistent disparities in SCNC outcomes by race/ethnicity, all groups saw some gains in re-enrollment, perseverance, or credential earning over the past three years.\n- Potential Completers — students with at least two years of full-time equivalent enrollment prior to stopping out — are more likely to re-enroll, earn a credential in their first year back, persevere into a second year of re-enrollment, and complete a credential in their second year.\n- Community colleges and primarily online institutions stand out for the outsized role they play in SCNC dynamics. Community colleges are both the major source of stopout and the primary destination for returning SCNC students. Primarily online institutions account for a disproportionately high share of re-enrollees compared to the share of SCNC individuals who last attended these institutions.\n- Each year, about 1 in 4 SCNC credential earners earn a credential without having to re-enroll. While our data does not identify causes, these completers may be the beneficiaries of policies that remove administrative barriers to completion or award credentials based on the number of credits already earned in the past.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Education paused collections on defaulted federal student loans.1 This year, collections are set to resume and almost 6 million student loan borrowers with loans in default will again be subject to the Department of Education’s forced collection of their tax refunds, wages, and Social Security benefits.2 Among the borrowers who are likely to experience forced collections are an estimated 452,000 borrowers ages 62 and older with defaulted loans who are likely receiving Social Security benefits.3\nThis spotlight describes the circumstances and experiences of student loan borrowers affected by the forced collection of Social Security benefits.4 It also describes how forced collections can push older borrowers into poverty, undermining the purpose of the Social Security program.5\nKey findings\n- The number of Social Security beneficiaries experiencing forced collection grew by more than 3,000 percent in fewer than 20 years; the count is likely to grow as the age of student loan borrowers trends older. Between 2001 and 2019, the number of Social Security beneficiaries experiencing reduced benefits due to forced collection increased from approximately 6,200 to 192,300. This exponential growth is likely driven by older borrowers who make up an increasingly large share of the federal student loan portfolio. The number of student loan borrowers ages 62 and older increased by 59 percent from 1.7 million in 2017 to 2.7 million in 2023, compared to a 1 percent decline among borrowers under the age of 62.\n- The total amount of Social Security benefits the Department of Education collected between 2001 and 2019 through the offset program increased from $16.2 million to $429.7 million. Despite the exponential increase in collections from Social Security, the majority of money the Department of Education has collected has been applied to interest and fees and has not affected borrowers’ principal amount owed. Furthermore, between 2016 and 2019, the Department of the Treasury’s fees alone accounted for nearly 10 percent of the average borrower’s lost Social Security benefits.\n- More than one in three Social Security recipients with student loans are reliant on Social Security payments, meaning forced collections could significantly imperil their financial well-being. Approximately 37 percent of the 1.3 million Social Security beneficiaries with student loans rely on modest payments, an average monthly benefit of $1,523, for 90 percent of their income. This population is particularly vulnerable to reduction in their benefits especially if benefits are offset year-round. In 2019, the average annual amount collected from individual beneficiaries was $2,232 ($186 per month).\n- The physical well-being of half of Social Security beneficiaries with student loans in default may be at risk. Half of Social Security beneficiaries with student loans in default and collections skipped a doctor’s visit or did not obtain prescription medication due to cost.\n- Existing minimum income protections fail to protect student loan borrowers with Social Security against financial hardship. Currently, only $750 per month of Social Security income—an amount that is $400 below the monthly poverty threshold for an individual and has not been adjusted for inflation since 1996—is protected from forced collections by statute. Even if the minimum protected income was adjusted for inflation, beneficiaries would likely still experience hardship, such as food insecurity and problems paying utility bills. A higher threshold could protect borrowers against hardship more effectively. The CFPB found that for 87 percent of student loan borrowers who receive Social Security, their benefit amount is below 225 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL), an income level at which people are as likely to experience material hardship as those with incomes below the federal poverty level.\n- Large shares of Social Security beneficiaries affected by forced collections may be eligible for relief or outright loan cancellation, yet they are unable to access these benefits, possibly due to insufficient automation or borrowers’ cognitive and physical decline. As many as eight in ten Social Security beneficiaries with loans in default may be eligible to suspend or reduce forced collections due to financial hardship. Moreover, one in five Social Security beneficiaries may be eligible for discharge of their loans due to a disability. Yet these individuals are not accessing such relief because the Department of Education’s data matching process insufficiently identifies those who may be eligible.\nTaken together, these findings suggest that the Department of Education’s forced collections of Social Security benefits increasingly interfere with Social Security’s longstanding purpose of protecting its beneficiaries from poverty and financial instability.\nIntroduction\nWhen borrowers default on their federal student loans, the Department of Education can collect the outstanding balance through forced collections, including the offset of tax refunds and Social Security benefits, and the garnishment of wages. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Education paused collections on defaulted federal student loans. This year, collections are set to resume and almost 6 million student loan borrowers with loans in default will again be subject to the Department of Education’s forced collection of their tax refunds, wages, and Social Security benefits.6\nAmong the borrowers who are likely to experience the Department of Education’s renewed forced collections are an estimated 452,000 borrowers with defaulted loans who are ages 62 and older and who are likely receiving Social Security benefits.7 Congress created the Social Security program in 1935 to provide a basic level of income that protects insured workers and their families from poverty due to situations including old age, widowhood, or disability.8 The Social Security Administration calls the program “one of the most successful anti-poverty programs in our nation's history.”9 In 2022, Social Security lifted over 29 million Americans from poverty, including retirees, disabled adults, and their spouses and dependents.10 Congress has recognized the importance of securing the value of Social Security benefits and on several occasions has intervened to protect them.11\nThis spotlight describes the circumstances and experiences of student loan borrowers affected by the forced collection of their Social Security benefits.12 It also describes how the purpose of Social Security is being increasingly undermined by the limited and deficient options the Department of Education has to protect Social Security beneficiaries from poverty and hardship.\nThe forced collection of Social Security benefits has increased exponentially.\nFederal student loans enter default after 270 days of missed payments and transfer to the Department of Education’s default collections program after 360 days. Borrowers with a loan in default face several consequences: (1) their credit is negatively affected; (2) they lose eligibility to receive federal student aid while their loans are in default; (3) they are unable to change repayment plans and request deferment and forbearance;13 and (4) they face forced collections of tax refunds, Social Security benefits, and wages among other payments.14 To conduct its forced collections of federal payments like tax refunds and Social Security benefits, the Department of Education relies on a collection service run by the U.S. Department of the Treasury called the Treasury Offset Program.15\nBetween 2001 and 2019, the number of student loan borrowers facing forced collection of their Social Security benefits increased from at least 6,200 to 192,300.16 That is a more than 3,000 percent increase in fewer than 20 years. By comparison, the number of borrowers facing forced collections of their tax refunds increased by about 90 percent from 1.17 million to 2.22 million during the same period.17\nThis exponential growth of Social Security offsets between 2001 and 2019 is likely driven by multiple factors including:\n- Older borrowers accounted for an increasingly large share of the federal student loan portfolio due to increasing average age of enrollment and length of time in repayment. Data from the Department of Education (which is only available since 2017), show that the number of student loan borrowers ages 62 and older, increased 24 percent from 1.7 million in 2017 to 2.1 million in 2019, compared to less than 1 percent among borrowers under the age of 62.18\n- A larger number of borrowers, especially older borrowers, had loans in default. Data from the Department of Education show that the number of student loan borrowers with a defaulted loan increased by 230 percent from 3.8 million in 2006 to 8.8 million in 2019.19 Compounding these trends is the fact that older borrowers are twice as likely to have a loan in default than younger borrowers.20\nDue to these factors, the total amount of Social Security benefits the Department of Education collected between 2001 and 2019 through the offset program increased annually from $16.2 million to $429.7 million (when adjusted for inflation).21 This increase occurred even though the average monthly amount the Department of Education collected from individual beneficiaries was the same for most years, at approximately $180 per month.22\nFigure 1: Number of Social Security beneficiaries and total amount collected for student loans (2001-2019)\nWhile the total collected from Social Security benefits has increased exponentially, the majority of money the Department of Education collected has not been applied to borrowers’ principal amount owed. Specifically, nearly three-quarters of the monies the Department of Education collects through offsets is applied to interest and fees, and not towards paying down principal balances.23 Between 2016 and 2019, the U.S. Department of the Treasury charged the Department of Education between $13.12 and $15.00 per Social Security offset, or approximately between $157.44 and $180 for 12 months of Social Security offsets per beneficiary with defaulted federal student loans.24 As a matter of practice, the Department of Education often passes these fees on directly to borrowers.25 Furthermore, these fees accounted for nearly 10 percent of the average monthly borrower’s lost Social Security benefits which was $183 during this time.26 Interest and fees not only reduce beneficiaries’ monthly benefits, but also prolong the period that beneficiaries are likely subject to forced collections.\nForced collections are compromising Social Security beneficiaries’ financial well-being.\nForced collection of Social Security benefits affects the financial well-being of the most vulnerable borrowers and can exacerbate any financial and health challenges they may already be experiencing. The CFPB’s analysis of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) pooled data for 2018 to 2021 finds that Social Security beneficiaries with student loans receive an average monthly benefit of $1,524.27 The analysis also indicates that approximately 480,000 (37 percent) of the 1.3 million beneficiaries with student loans rely on these modest payments for 90 percent or more of their income,28 thereby making them particularly vulnerable to reduction in their benefits especially if benefits are offset year-round. In 2019, the average annual amount collected from individual beneficiaries was $2,232 ($186 per month).29\nA recent survey from The Pew Charitable Trusts found that more than nine in ten borrowers who reported experiencing wage garnishment or Social Security payment offsets said that these penalties caused them financial hardship.30 Consequently, for many, their ability to meet their basic needs, including access to healthcare, became more difficult. According to our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Household Economic and Decision-making (SHED), half of Social Security beneficiaries with defaulted student loans skipped a doctor’s visit and/or did not obtain prescription medication due to cost.31 Moreover, 36 percent of Social Security beneficiaries with loans in delinquency or in collections report fair or poor health. Over half of them have medical debt.32\nFigure 2: Selected financial experiences and hardships among subgroups of loan borrowers\nSocial Security recipients subject to forced collection may not be able to access key public benefits that could help them mitigate the loss of income. This is because Social Security beneficiaries must list the unreduced amount of their benefits prior to collections when applying for other means-tested benefits programs such as Social Security Insurance (SSI), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and the Medicare Savings Programs.33 Consequently, beneficiaries subject to forced collections must report an inflated income relative to what they are actually receiving. As a result, these beneficiaries may be denied public benefits that provide food, medical care, prescription drugs, and assistance with paying for other daily living costs.34\nConsumers’ complaints submitted to the CFPB describe the hardship caused by forced collections on borrowers reliant on Social Security benefits to pay for essential expenses.35 Consumers often explain their difficulty paying for such expenses as rent and medical bills. In one complaint, a consumer noted that they were having difficulty paying their rent since their Social Security benefit usually went to paying that expense.36 In another complaint, a caregiver described that the money was being withheld from their mother’s Social Security, which was the only source of income used to pay for their mother’s care at an assisted living facility.37 As forced collections threaten the housing security and health of Social Security beneficiaries, they also create a financial burden on non-borrowers who help address these hardships, including family members and caregivers.\nExisting minimum income protections fail to protect student loan borrowers with Social Security against financial hardship.\nThe Debt Collection Improvement Act set a minimum floor of income below which the federal government cannot offset Social Security benefits and subsequent Treasury regulations established a cap on the percentage of income above that floor.38 Specifically, these statutory guardrails limit collections to 15 percent of Social Security benefits above $750. The minimum threshold was established in 1996 and has not been updated since. As a result, the amount protected by law alone does not adequately protect beneficiaries from financial hardship and in fact no longer protects them from falling below the federal poverty level (FPL). In 1996, $750 was nearly $100 above the monthly poverty threshold for an individual.39 Today that same protection is $400 below the threshold. If the protected amount of $750 per month ($9,000 per year) set in 1996 was adjusted for inflation, in 2024 dollars, it would total $1,450 per month ($17,400 per year).40\nFigure 3: Comparison of monthly FPL threshold with the current protected amount established in 1996 and the amount that would be protected with inflation adjustment\nEven if the minimum protected income of $750 is adjusted for inflation, beneficiaries will likely still experience hardship as a result of their reduced benefits. Consumers with incomes above the poverty line also commonly experience material hardship.41 This suggests that a threshold that is higher than the poverty level will more effectively protect against hardship.42 Indeed, in determining an income threshold for $0 payments under the SAVE plan, the Department of Education researchers used material hardship (defined as being unable to pay utility bills and reporting food insecurity) as their primary metric, and found similar levels of material hardship among those with incomes below the poverty line and those with incomes up to 225 percent of the FPL.43 Similarly, the CFPB’s analysis of a pooled sample of SIPP respondents finds the same levels of material hardship for Social Security beneficiaries with student loans with incomes below 100 percent of the FPL and those with incomes up to 225 percent of the FPL.44 The CFPB found that for 87 percent of student loan borrowers who receive Social Security, their benefit amount is below 225 percent of the FPL.45 Accordingly, all of those borrowers would be removed from forced collections if the Department of Education applied the same income metrics it established under the SAVE program to an automatic hardship exemption program.\nExisting options for relief from forced collections fail to reach older borrowers.\nBorrowers with loans in default remain eligible for certain types of loan cancellation and relief from forced collections. However, our analysis suggests that these programs may not be reaching many eligible consumers. When borrowers do not benefit from these programs, their hardship includes, but is not limited to, unnecessary losses to their Social Security benefits and negative credit reporting.\nBorrowers who become disabled after reaching full retirement age may miss out on Total and Permanent Disability\nThe Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) discharge program cancels federal student loans and effectively stops all forced collections for disabled borrowers who meet certain requirements. After recent revisions to the program, this form of cancelation has become common for those borrowers with Social Security who became disabled prior to full retirement age.46 In 2016, a GAO study documented the significant barriers to TPD that Social Security beneficiaries faced.47 To address GAO’s concerns, the Department of Education in 2021 took a series of mitigating actions, including entering into a data-matching agreement with the Social Security Administration (SSA) to automate the TPD eligibility determination and discharge process.48 This process was expanded further with new final rules being implemented July 1, 2023 that expanded the categories of borrowers eligible for automatic TPD cancellation.49 In total, these changes successfully resulted in loan cancelations for approximately 570,000 borrowers.50\nHowever, the automation and other regulatory changes did not significantly change the application process for consumers who become disabled after they reach full retirement age or who have already claimed the Social Security retirement benefits. For these beneficiaries, because they are already receiving retirement benefits, SSA does not need to determine disability status. Likewise, SSA does not track disability status for those individuals who become disabled after they start collecting their Social Security retirement benefits.51\nConsequently, SSA does not transfer information on disability to the Department of Education once the beneficiary begins collecting Social Security retirement.52 These individuals therefore will not automatically get a TPD discharge of their student loans, and they must be aware and physically and mentally able to proactively apply for the discharge.53\nThe CFPB’s analysis of the Census survey data suggests that the population that is excluded from the TPD automation process could be substantial. More than one in five (22 percent) Social Security beneficiaries with student loans are receiving retirement benefits and report a disability such as a limitation with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognition.54 People with dementia and other cognitive disabilities are among those with the greatest risk of being excluded, since they are more likely to be diagnosed after the age 70, which is the maximum age for claiming retirement benefits.55\nThese limitations may also help explain why older borrowers are less likely to rehabilitate their defaulted student loans. Specifically, 11 percent of student loan borrowers ages 50 to 59 facing forced collections successfully rehabilitated their loans,56 while only five percent of borrowers over the age of 75 do so.57\nFigure 4: Number of student loan borrowers ages 50 and older in forced collection, borrowers who signed a rehabilitation agreement, and borrowers who successfully rehabilitated a loan by selected age groups\n| Age Group | Number of Borrowers in Offset | Number of Borrowers Who Signed a Rehabilitation Agreement | Percent of Borrowers Who Signed a Rehabilitation Agreement | Number of Borrowers Successfully Rehabilitated | Percent of Borrowers who Successfully Rehabilitated |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 50 to 59 | 265,200 | 50,800 | 14% | 38,400 | 11% |\n| 60 to 74 | 184,900 | 24,100 | 11% | 18,500 | 8% |\n| 75 and older | 15,800 | 1,000 | 6% | 800 | 5% |\nShifting demographics of student loan borrowers suggest that the current automation process may become less effective to protect Social Security benefits from forced collections as more and more older adults have student loan debt. The fastest growing segment of student loan borrowers are adults ages 62 and older. These individuals are generally eligible for retirement benefits, not disability benefits, because they cannot receive both classifications at the same time. Data from the Department of Education reflect that the number of student loan borrowers ages 62 and older increased by 59 percent from 1.7 million in 2017 to 2.7 million in 2023. In comparison, the number of borrowers under the age of 62 remained unchanged at 43 million in both years.58 Furthermore, additional data provided to the CFPB by the Department of Education show that nearly 90,000 borrowers ages 81 and older hold an average amount of $29,000 in federal student loan debt, a substantial amount despite facing an estimated average life expectancy of less than nine years.59\nExisting exceptions to forced collections fail to protect many Social Security beneficiaries\nIn addition to TPD discharge, the Department of Education offers reduction or suspension of Social Security offset where borrowers demonstrate financial hardship.60 To show hardship, borrowers must provide documentation of their income and expenses, which the Department of Education then uses to make its determination.61 Unlike the Debt Collection Improvement Act’s minimum protections, the eligibility for hardship is based on a comparison of an individual’s documented income and qualified expenses. If the borrower has eligible monthly expenses that exceed or match their income, the Department of Education then grants a financial hardship exemption.62\nThe CFPB’s analysis suggests that the vast majority of Social Security beneficiaries with student loans would qualify for a hardship protection. According to CFPB’s analysis of the Federal Reserve Board’s SHED, eight in ten (82 percent) of Social Security beneficiaries with student loans in default report that their expenses equal or exceed their income.63 Accordingly, these individuals would likely qualify for a full suspension of forced collections. Yet the GAO found that in 2015 (when the last data was available) less than ten percent of Social Security beneficiaries with forced collections applied for a hardship exemption or reduction of their offset.64 A possible reason for the low uptake rate is that many beneficiaries or their caregivers never learn about the hardship exemption or the possibility of a reduction in the offset amount.65 For those that do apply, only a fraction get relief. The GAO study found that at the time of their initial offset, only about 20 percent of Social Security beneficiaries ages 50 and older with forced collections were approved for a financial hardship exemption or a reduction of the offset amount if they applied.66\nConclusion\nAs hundreds of thousands of student loan borrowers with loans in default face the resumption of forced collection of their Social Security benefits, this spotlight shows that the forced collection of Social Security benefits causes significant hardship among affected borrowers. The spotlight also shows that the basic income protections aimed at preventing poverty and hardship among affected borrowers have become increasingly ineffective over time. While the Department of Education has made some improvements to expand access to relief options, especially for those who initially receive Social Security due to a disability, these improvements are insufficient to protect older adults from the forced collection of their Social Security benefits.\nTaken together, these findings suggest that forced collections of Social Security benefits increasingly interfere with Social Security’s longstanding purpose of protecting its beneficiaries from poverty and financial instability. These findings also suggest that alternative approaches are needed to address the harm that forced collections cause on beneficiaries and to compensate for the declining effectiveness of existing remedies. One potential solution may be found in the Debt Collection Improvement Act, which provides that when forced collections “interfere substantially with or defeat the purposes of the payment certifying agency’s program” the head of an agency may request from the Secretary of the Treasury an exemption from forced collections.67 Given the data findings above, such a request for relief from the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration on behalf of Social Security beneficiaries who have defaulted student loans could be justified. Unless the toll of forced collections on Social Security beneficiaries is considered alongside the program’s stated goals, the number of older adults facing these challenges is only set to grow.\nData and Methodology\nTo develop this report, the CFPB relied primarily upon original analysis of public-use data from the U.S. Census Bureau Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the Federal Reserve Board Board’s Survey of Household Economics and Decision-making (SHED), U.S. Department of the Treasury, Fiscal Data portal, consumer complaints received by the Bureau, and administrative data on borrowers in default provided by the Department of Education. The report also leverages data and findings from other reports, studies, and sources, and cites to these sources accordingly. Readers should note that estimates drawn from survey data are subject to measurement error resulting, among other things, from reporting biases and question wording.\nSurvey of Income and Program Participation\nThe Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is a nationally representative survey of U.S. households conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The SIPP collects data from about 20,000 households (40,000 people) per wave. The survey captures a wide range of characteristics and information about these households and their members. The CFPB relied on a pooled sample of responses from 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 waves for a total number of 17,607 responses from student loan borrowers across all waves, including 920 respondents with student loans receiving Social Security benefits. The CFPB’s analysis relied on the public use data. To capture student loan debt, the survey asked to all respondents (variable EOEDDEBT): Owed any money for student loans or educational expenses in own name only during the reference period. To capture receipt of Social Security benefits, the survey asked to all respondents (variable ESSSANY): “Did ... receive Social Security benefits for himself/herself at any time during the reference period?” To capture amount of Social Security benefits, the survey asked to all respondents (variable TSSSAMT): “How much did ... receive in Social Security benefit payment in this month (1-12), prior to any deductions for Medicare premiums?”\nThe public-use version of the survey dataset, and the survey documentation can be found at: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp.html .\nSurvey of Household Economics and Decision-making\nThe Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Household Economics and Decision-making (SHED) is an annual web-based survey of households. The survey captures information about respondents’ financial situations. The CFPB relied on a pooled sample of responses from 2019 through 2023 waves for a total number of 1,376 responses from student loan borrowers in collection across all waves. The CFPB analysis relied on the public use data. To capture default and collection, the survey asked all respondents with student loans (variable SL6): “Are you behind on payments or in collections for one or more of the student loans from your own education?” To capture receipt of Social Security benefits, the survey asked to all respondents (variable I0_c): “In the past 12 months, did you (and/or your spouse or partner) receive any income from the following sources: Social Security (including old age and DI)?”\nThe public-use version of the survey dataset, and the survey documentation can be found at https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed_data.htm .\nAppendix A: Number of student loan borrowers ages 60 and older, total outstanding balance, and average balance by age group, August 2024\n| Age Group | Borrower Count (in thousands) | Balance (in billions) | Average balance |\n|---|---|---|---|\n60 to 65 |\n1,951.4 |\n$87.49 |\n$44,834 |\n66 to 70 |\n909.8 |\n$39.47 |\n$43,383 |\n71 to 75 |\n457.5 |\n$18.95 |\n$41,421 |\n76 to 80 |\n179.0 |\n$6.80 |\n$37,989 |\n81 to 85 |\n59.9 |\n$1.90 |\n$31,720 |\n86 to 90 |\n20.1 |\n$0.51 |\n$25,373 |\n91 to 95 |\n7.0 |\n$0.14 |\n$20,000 |\n96+ |\n2.8 |\n$0.05 |\n$17,857 |\nEndnotes\n-\nThe CARES Act, passed on March 27, 2020, temporarily reduced interest rates to zero and suspended monthly payments for all federal loans owned by the Department of Education. While the payment suspension through the CARES Act expired on September 30, 2020, it was repeatedly extended administratively through October 2023. In 2021, the Department of Education extended these protections to defaulted commercially held FFEL loans. In addition to the payment “pause,” the CARES Act and other related initiatives temporarily removed many of the negative consequences of federal student loan default, such as forced collections and negative credit reporting, for certain borrowers.

The data, however, do not show the number of individuals in collection. The number of individuals is obtained by dividing the number of transactions by twelve (months), so it undercounts the number of borrowers to the extent that they enter and exit the Social Security or offset programs throughout the year for any reason. For the purposes of this analysis, the CFPB relied on the net amount collected and the net number of transactions where the creditor was the Department of Education and the payment source was Social Security Administration. The net amount and count of offsets represent the values once reversals have been removed. The data and information are available at https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/treasury-offset-program/federal-collections (Accessed April 8, 2024).

To obtain the share CFPB staff divided the total Social Security income (TSSSAMT) by the total personal income (TPTOTINC). Note, however, that multiple studies have found differences in the estimates of the relative importance of Social Security benefits between survey data and survey data supplemented with administrative data.

The ORES Working Paper also shows that when survey data on income is combined with administrative data from IRS and SSA, 39.9 percent of Social Security beneficiaries rely on Social Security for 50 or more of their income. The SIPP does not ask participants about collections or default in their student loans. However, the CFPB analysis of the pooled data from the Federal Reserve Board’s SHED, which does not include specific amount from Social Security benefits, suggests that a large share of beneficiaries affected by collections have low incomes. Our analysis finds that 44 percent of Social Security beneficiaries who are delinquent or in collections on their student loan have incomes below $25,000.\n↩ -\nGAO found that 58 percent of older borrowers who were subject to offset between 2001 and 2010 remained subject to offset for one year or more.

But there’s still more work to do. WATCH: What’s in the first draft of the GOP’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ cutting taxes and spending House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also worked past midnight trying to resolve issues with Trump’s plan. Opposition is mounting from various corners of the GOP majority as he tries to muscle the party’s signature package to passage without any votes from Democrats. On the one hand, the conservative leader of the Freedom Caucus derides the new Medicaid work requirements as a “joke” that do not go far enough at cost-cutting. Meanwhile, a handful of GOP lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states are refusing to support the measure unless changes are made to give deeper state and local tax deductions, called SALT, for their constituents back home. “To say we have a gulf is an understatement,” said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a leader of the conservative wing. Roy said there is “a significant number of us who could not bless this product” in its current form. Nevertheless, momentum is building toward an end-of-the-week inflection point to stitch together the sprawling package Friday at the Budget Committee. That means combining hundreds of pages of bill text covering $5 trillion in tax breaks and at least $1.5 trillion in spending reductions on Medicaid, food stamps and green energy programs to deliver Trump’s second-term legislative priority. WATCH: GOP Rep. Malliotakis on breaking with her party and taking a stand against Medicaid cuts Democrats decry the package as a give-away to the wealthy at the expense of safety net programs that millions of Americans rely on. But Johnson insists the Republican majority is on track to pass the package by Memorial Day, May 26, sending it to the Senate where Republicans are crafting their own version. With his slim majority, he can only afford a few defections from his ranks. “We’re still on target,” Johnson said at the Capitol. “The American people are counting on us.” Democrats also stayed up all night forcing marathon public hearings. One at the House Energy and Commerce Committee was still going more than 26 hours later before finishing Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday evening, the House Agriculture Committee handling the food aid cuts wrapped up its work too, but only after the Republican chairman abruptly shut down debate on dozens of remaining amendments from Democrats. All told, Democrats proposed hundreds of amendments trying to change the package, with dozens of votes that largely failed. READ MORE: House Republicans have unveiled proposed Medicaid cuts. Democrats say millions will lose coverage “It is a cruel, mean, rotten bill,” said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., as the Agriculture panel debated changes to the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program, known as SNAP. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said at least 7.6 million fewer people would have health insurance with reductions to Medicaid, and likely more with additional changes to the Affordable Care Act. The CBO also gave lawmakers a preliminary analysis showing that 3 million fewer people each month would participate in the SNAP food program under the changes proposed. More than 70 million Americans rely on Medicaid for health care, and about 40 million use SNAP. The Republicans are targeting Medicaid and SNAP for a combined $1 trillion in cuts as a way to offset the costs of the tax package, but also to achieve GOP goals of reining in the social safety net programs. Most of the cost-savings would come from imposing stiffer work requirements for those receiving the health care and food assistance, meaning fewer people would qualify for the aid. The legislation would raise from 54 to 64 the age of able-bodied adults without dependents who would have to work to qualify for SNAP. It also would also require some parents to work to qualify for the benefits once their children are older than 7, instead of 18. Under current law, those recipients must work or participate in a work program for 80 hours a month. The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., insists the changes would “strengthen and sustain” Medicaid for the future, and are the kind of “common sense” policies Trump promised voters. But Democrats told repeated stories of their constituents struggling to access health care. Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., revealed his own diagnosis with Type 2 diabetes at the House Ways and Means Committee hearing and the sticker shock of health costs. One of the most difficult issues for Johnson has been the more localized debate over state and local taxes as he works to come up with a compromise for New York, California and New Jersey lawmakers. They have rejected an offer to triple the deduction cap, now at $10,000, to $30,000 for married couples. The speaker met with lawmakers Tuesday and talks continued into Wednesday. Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., said it was cordial, but there was no deal. “More sizzle than steak in that meeting,” he said late Tuesday. “The reality is you need 218 votes to pass a bill and the way this bill is currently constructed, it will not have that because it does not adequately the issue of SALT,” said Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y. The lawmakers believe they have leverage in the talks because without a deal, the $10,000 limit established under the 2017 tax bill expires at the end of the year and reverts to no cap at all. But as Johnson and the lawmakers edge closer to a SALT deal, the conservatives are balking that their priorities must also be met. Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., said he’s a no for now, but would be working to improve the bill so that he could support it. The conservatives argue that the tax breaks without deeper spending cuts will pile onto the deficit, and they worry that the Medicaid reductions do not go far enough in rolling back federal funds to expand the Affordable Care Act. They also want the work requirements, which don’t take effect until Jan. 1, 2029, after Trump has left office, to start sooner. “Basically Republicans are enforcing Obamacare, which is a surreal situation to me,” Burlison said. Republicans are racing to extend Trump’s tax breaks, which are set to expire later this year, while adding the new ones he campaigned on in 2024, including no taxes on tips, Social Security benefits and others. A new analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation shows that most tax filers would see a lower tax rates under the proposal, except those at the lowest rates, who earn less than $15,000 a year.

The budget cannot be stalled in the Senate by filibuster, and it does not need the President’s signature.\nIf the budget calls for reconciliation, it tells certain committees to change spending, revenues, deficits, or the debt limit by specific amounts. Each committee writes a bill to achieve its target, and if more than one committee is told to act, the Budget Committee puts the bills together into one big bill.\nThat bill has special status in the Senate. Like the budget, it cannot be filibustered, and only needs a simple majority to pass.\nWhy not use it for everything?\nOther special rules, which are designed to protect the rights of the minority party, apply to reconciliation bills. Only policies that change spending or revenues can be included. Senate debate time is limited, and only certain kinds of amendments can be offered. For example, the Social Security program cannot be changed in reconciliation.\nThe Basics\nBudget reconciliation provides a fast-track process for consideration of bills to implement the policy choices embodied in the annual congressional budget resolution. This report summarizes the reconciliation process and the recent history of its use.\nOverview\nIn its annual budget resolution, Congress sets total spending, revenues, the surplus or deficit, and the public debt. The budget may also include reconciliation instructions. These instructions direct one or more committees to recommend changes to existing law to achieve specified changes in spending, revenues, deficits, and/or the debt limit.[1]\nIn the Senate, the resulting reconciliation bill incorporating those proposals is considered under expedited procedures that limit debate and amendments. Like the budget resolution, a reconciliation bill cannot be filibustered in the Senate and therefore needs only a simple majority to move to a final vote. However, there are limitations on the substance of what can be included in a reconciliation bill, although a 60-vote majority in the Senate can override any objections.\nHow Reconciliation Works in the House\nEach instructed committee drafts recommendations for spending and/or revenue changes in a manner subject to its committee rules and the rules of the House. For example, the House rule on germaneness is enforceable in committees. In meeting its reconciliation instructions, a committee may choose to increase costs in some areas as well as reduce costs in others, so long as the net budgetary effect of a committee’s proposals complies with its instruction.\nCommittees submit their recommendations for spending and/or revenue changes to the Budget Committee, where the separate measures are packaged and reported to the floor (when only one committee has instructions, that committee reports its measure directly to the floor). The Budget Committee cannot make substantive changes to the recommendations, even if the committees fail to meet the targets specified in the reconciliation directive.\nAmendments to Reconciliation on the House Floor\nThe Budget Committee markup of the reconciliation recommendations generally includes non-binding motions offered by the minority to instruct the Committee Chair to ask the Rules Committee to make specific amendments in order on the floor. In addition, any House Member may ask the Rules Committee to allow amendments to the reconciliation package on the House floor. The Rules Committee historically has been receptive to amendments proposed by the Chair of the Budget Committee, which generally reflect leadership views. In the past, the Rules Committee has made the Budget Committee Chair’s amendment in order, sometimes incorporating it into the measure through a self-executing rule.\nUnder the Congressional Budget Act, there is a point of order against amendments that worsen the deficit relative to the underlying bill.[2] All amendments must also be germane to the underlying bill.\nBenefits of Reconciliation in the Senate\nThe reconciliation procedures in Senate committees are similar to those in the House. In the Senate, however, reconciliation bills are subject to expedited procedures during floor consideration, as well as specific limits imposed by the so-called “Byrd rule” (described further below).\nThe first major benefit is that debate on a reconciliation bill or reconciliation conference report is limited to 20 hours, so it cannot be filibustered on the Senate floor. The practical effect is that the bill can be passed with a simple majority vote, in contrast to most legislation, which requires a 60-vote supermajority to invoke cloture and limit debate. After time for debate has expired, Senators may continue to offer amendments, but they are not debatable. This is colloquially referred to as “vote-a-rama.” Second, amendments to a reconciliation bill must be germane, which is normally not the case in the Senate.\nThird, with only a few exceptions, amendments to a reconciliation bill on the Senate floor cannot increase the deficit; they must either lessen the deficit or be deficit-neutral. One exception is that amendments striking an entire provision are always in order, even if the provision being removed saves money. In the Senate, if the reconciliation bill fails to comply with a committee’s target, there is a procedure to allow non-germane floor amendments to bring the bill into compliance with the reconciliation instructions.\nLimitations of Reconciliation in the Senate – The Byrd Rule\nNamed for Senator Robert Byrd, the Byrd rule (Section 313 of the Congressional Budget Act) was first adopted in the mid-1980s to limit extraneous provisions from inclusion in reconciliation bills. Because reconciliation bills are considered using expedited procedures in the Senate, the Byrd rule is aimed at preventing the use of reconciliation to move a legislative agenda unrelated to spending or taxes, and to some extent it limits Congress’ ability to use reconciliation to increase deficits – at least over the long-term. The Byrd rule prohibits the inclusion of “extraneous” measures in reconciliation, defining “extraneous” as follows:\n- measures with no budgetary effect (i.e., no change in outlays or revenues);\n- measures that worsen the deficit when a committee has not achieved its reconciliation target;\n- measures outside the jurisdiction of the committee that submitted the title or provision;\n- measures that produce a budgetary effect that is merely incidental to the non- budgetary policy change;\n- measures that increase deficits for any fiscal year outside the reconciliation window; and\n- measures that recommend changes in Social Security.\nAny Senator may raise a point of order against an extraneous provision in the reconciliation bill, amendments, or the conference agreement. The Senate Parliamentarian decides whether there is a Byrd rule violation, and provisions struck through a Byrd rule point of order cannot be offered later as amendments. However, Byrd rule points of order can be waived by a vote of 60 Senators.\nIn addition to reconciliation-specific points of order, reconciliation bills are subject to other Senate points of order, like the Senate PAYGO rule, that apply to all legislation.\nReconciliation Conference Agreement Procedures\nEven though a conference agreement cannot be amended, it is still subject to Byrd rule requirements in the Senate. Thus, although the Byrd rule does not apply in the House, it constrains what can be included in the reconciliation conference agreement. A provision violating the Byrd rule can be struck from the conference agreement on the Senate floor unless 60 Senators vote to waive the point of order. Stripping a provision due to a Byrd rule violation does not mean the conference agreement is defeated, just that the agreement will be sent to the House without the stripped provision.\nRecent History\nSince 1980, Congress has sent 27 reconciliation measures to the President – 4 bills were vetoed and 23 enacted – primarily legislation that reduced the deficit through cuts in mandatory spending or increases in revenues. However, beginning in the early 2000s, Republican Congresses began to routinely use reconciliation to increase the deficit, enacting major tax cuts without offsetting the revenue loss in 2001, 2003, and 2006. [3]\nIn the 115th Congress, Republicans used reconciliation to enact their tax law. In the final months of 2017, the House and Senate approved a reconciliation measure to cut taxes mostly for the wealthy and corporations and to eliminate the penalty for not having health insurance. The Congressional Budget Office estimated at the time that the legislation would add $1.5 trillion to federal deficits over 10 years, which has been revised to $1.9 trillion. President Trump signed this legislation into law on December 22, 2017. Earlier in that same year, Republicans attempted to use reconciliation to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. The House approved a reconciliation measure to repeal major provisions of the health care law and cap federal funding for Medicaid, but the Senate failed to get the needed votes to advance a bill.\nIn the 117th Congress, Democrats used reconciliation in 2021 to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic and provide critical, immediate assistance to families and businesses. In 2022, Democrats used reconciliation to lower the cost of prescription drugs and health care, and invest in cleaner, cheaper energy for American families.\n[1] The Congressional Budget Act defines reconciliation bills that include changes to Social Security as out of order, however.\n[2] Even if the underlying bill achieves greater savings than the budget resolution instructed, amendments that worsen the deficit are not permitted in the House.\n[3] See Congressional Research Service Report R40480, “Budget Reconciliation Measures Enacted into Law Since 1980.”\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        STOP TRUMP FROM RIGGING THE 2026 ELECTION\nDonald Trump and Texas Republicans are making an unprecedented power grab to steal congressional seats and rig the 2026 election before voting even begins.\nOther Republican states are following suit. They want to steal enough seats to control Congress even if voters overwhelmingly reject their agenda.\nThis isn’t politics as usual. It’s an emergency for our democracy.\nENSURE FAIR REPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS\nWe have already seen how Trump has recklessly imposed tariffs and hurt California families, denied disaster assistance to fire victims, and ordered mass arrests without warrants. The 2026 election for Congress represents our only chance to provide an essential check and balance on Trump’s dangerous agenda.\nIf Californians don’t act now, Donald Trump will seize total power for two more years. Proposition 50, the Election Rigging Response Act, will put a stop to their anti-democratic scheme. Here’s what it does.\nPROTECT DEMOCRACY IN ALL 50 STATES\nCalifornia has a duty to defend democracy. To do that, we can’t unilaterally disarm or fight with both hands tied behind our backs. When Trump tries to rig elections, we must fight back with every tool available.\nProp. 50 draws fair maps that represent California’s diverse communities and ensure our voices aren’t silenced by partisan gerrymandering in other states.\nCalifornia leads the nation in protecting voting rights and fair elections. When other states try to silence our voices and rig the system, we must respond decisively.\nJoin President Barack Obama, Governor Gavin Newsom, Senator Alex Padilla, Senator Adam Schiff, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, election experts, independent redistricting commissioners, Planned Parenthood, the NAACP, California veterans, teachers, and nurses.\nVote YES on Prop. 50 to stop Trump’s election rigging scheme.\nVote YES for checks and balances.\nVote YES to protect democracy in all 50 states.\nGovernor Gavin Newsom\nU.S. Senator Alex Padilla\nU.S. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi\nTHE WRONG PATH—NO ON PROP. 50\nWe know American democracy is on fire, but accelerating gerrymandering only adds fuel! Politicians are seizing this crisis to justify a power grab.\nPROP. 50 DOES NOT DEFEND OUR DEMOCRACY\nProp. 50 is not a magic pill to cure the nation’s ills. It claims to protect democracy, yet diminishes our communities’ voices and is ineffective against any overreach of presidential power. Vote NO.\nCalifornia gerrymandering allowed the Legislature to draw partisan seats without transparency or citizen input, solely to protect incumbents. By 2001, the government was gridlocked, with legislators held hostage to the extremes of their parties. Voters rose up and handed line-drawing over to citizens, resulting in:\nWE THE PEOPLE\nDistricts do not belong to either party; they belong to the People. But, party bosses want to call the shots—again. NO to a “pay-to-play” system.\nProp. 50 says this is “temporary,” yet the Legislature will bypass the independent Citizens Redistricting Commission again in 2028, 2030—and perhaps beyond. Don’t be fooled. Legislators drew this map behind closed doors for you to rubberstamp. It is not your choice.\nVote NO on partisan gerrymandering. Vote NO on Prop. 50.\nCynthia Dai, Rotating Chair\nFirst Citizens Redistricting Commission\nJeanne Raya, Rotating Chair\nFirst Citizens Redistricting Commission\nJodie Filkins Webber, Rotating Chair\nFirst Citizens Redistricting Commission\nPROPOSITION 50: A POWER GRAB BY POLITICIANS\nProp. 50 was written by politicians, for politicians. Prop. 50 dismantles constitutional safeguards that keep election maps fair. It removes requirements to keep cities, counties, and local communities together, and eliminates voter protections that ban maps designed to favor incumbents or political parties—putting politicians back in charge of drawing their own districts, or those of their friends.\nA “NO” vote protects fair elections and keeps the people of California—not politicians—in charge of redistricting.\nNO ON PROP. 50: IT REPEALS LANDMARK VOTER-APPROVED ELECTION REFORMS\nFor decades, Sacramento politicians drew their own district boundaries behind closed doors with no public oversight—guaranteeing their reelection, denying voters a real choice, and shutting out many women and people of color from elected office.\nIn 2008, California voters approved historic election reform—creating the independent California Citizens Redistricting Commission. Voters decided district lines should be drawn by a balanced panel of everyday citizens—not by politicians who stood to benefit.\nProp. 50 throws out citizen-drawn congressional maps created through a transparent public process with input from over 35,000 Californians. Instead, politicians secretly drew maps—leaving voters with NO real say.\nNO ON PROP. 50: ANOTHER SCHEME TO PERMANENTLY END INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING\nIn 2008 and 2010, the Democratic Party and special interests spent millions of dollars to stop citizen redistricting. Later, the California Republican Party even sued to overturn citizen-drawn maps—and lost. Now, Sacramento politicians are scheming to regain control with Prop. 50.\nMake no mistake: Prop. 50 is not temporary. For over half a decade, politicians get to impose their gerrymandered maps. Worse, it sets a dangerous precedent—opening the door for Sacramento to keep drawing election maps beyond 2031—giving politicians permanent power to shield themselves and their allies from accountability for California’s high cost of living, skyrocketing housing costs, and rising energy bills.\nNO ON PROP. 50: DON’T BE MISLED BY POLITICAL SPIN\nThe same politicians who opposed independent redistricting from the start now claim Prop. 50 will “save democracy.” In truth, Prop. 50 weakens fair representation by shutting the public out and bringing gerrymandering back to California.\nProp. 50 is not democratic; it gives voters a take-it-or-leave-it decision on the most partisan maps in California’s history—a product of politicians’ secretive backroom deals with ZERO meaningful public engagement.\nProp. 50 divides communities to benefit politicians, splitting counties 114 times and cities 141 times—far more than the citizen-drawn maps.\n“When politicians gerrymander, they divide our neighborhoods and weaken the voice of communities of color. Whatever happens in Texas, we cannot save democracy by destroying it in California. Vote NO on Prop. 50.”—Reverend Mac Shorty, Civil Rights Leader\nNO ON PROP. 50: A MASSIVE WASTE OF TAXPAYER MONEY\nThe Legislature has called a special election just to pass this politician-protecting constitutional change—costing taxpayers $200,000,000.\nWith a massive budget deficit, Sacramento politicians are making painful cuts to health care, housing, education, and public safety. Instead of protecting important programs, they’re spending it on a political power grab.\nVote NO on Prop. 50.\nRoberto Moncada, Board Member\nUnited Latinos Action\nFaith Bautista Tamashiro, President\nNational Diversity Coalition\nTaylor Shorty, Board Member\nCommunity RePower Movement\nWARNING: NO ON 50 IS BACKED BY TRUMP EXTREMISTS\nWho’s spending millions against Prop. 50?\nAn anti-choice mega-millionaire named Charles Munger Jr. who wants to help Donald Trump and Red State Republicans rig the 2026 elections and hand Trump unchecked power for two more years.;\nIndependent redistricting commissioners, election experts, and leading civil rights organizations—from the NAACP to the National Democratic Redistricting Committee—urge you to reject the lies spread by NO on 50’s phony front groups.\nLie #1: “Prop. 50 repeals landmark voter-approved election reforms.” This is plainly false. Prop. 50 calls on all states to end partisan gerrymandering and reaffirms the power of the California Citizens Redistricting Commission to draw the lines after the next census.\nLie #2: “Prop. 50 removes requirements to keep cities, counties, and local communities together.” Prop. 50 does the opposite, keeping MORE cities and counties combined, and communities together than California’s existing maps.\nLie #3: “Prop. 50 puts politicians back in charge of drawing their own districts.” Untrue. Prop. 50 puts power to approve emergency maps in the hands of voters, not politicians.\nLie #4: “Prop. 50 permanently ends independent redistricting.” Also untrue. Prop. 50 is a temporary and proportional response to Trump’s election-rigging scheme and expires in 2030.\nCalifornians cannot allow Donald Trump and Texas Republicans to rig the 2026 election and silence our voices.\nVote YES on Prop. 50.\nProtect democracy, preserve nonpartisan redistricting and ensure a fair election in all 50 states.\nSara Sadhwani, Commissioner\n2020 California Citizens Redistricting Commission\nJodi Hicks, President\nPlanned Parenthood Affiliates of California\nNikki Davis Milevsky, President\nSacramento City Teachers Association\nArguments printed on this page are the opinions of the authors and have not been checked for accuracy by any official agency.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Launched the nation’s first statewide voucher program. Proposed statewide increases in class size. Would relax accountability measures for charter schools.\nOn Colleges and Universities:\nEnded affirmative action in Florida’s colleges and universities, leading to a sharp drop in minority higher education enrollment. Put sharp limits on state funding for public colleges and universities, and instead directed Florida’s public colleges and universities to raise the cost of tuition. Supports the expansion of for-profit colleges, and would limit federal oversight of their business practices.\nOn Health Insurance:\nDoes not support the Affordable Care Act and calls it “flawed to the core.” Would repeal the parts of the ACA that keep down the costs of prescription drugs. Introduced a pilot program as governor to privatize Medicaid in Florida.\nOn Healthcare:\nServed for eight years on the board of directors of for-profit hospital corporation Tenet Healthcare. Now serves on the board of directors of Jackson Healthcare, one of the nation’s largest for-profit healthcare staffing corporations.\nOn Jobs and the Economy:\nAttacked tenure protections, and excluded unions from debates over education policy.

Jordan Teuscher (R-South Jordan) and other anti-public education legislators, will silence public educators, eliminate bargaining rights, and weaken unions that advocate for student success and quality public schools.\nTake action and stand with Utah's 30,000 public educators!\nThe Danger of H.B. 267\nH.B. 267 Public Sector Labor Union Amendments will drastically limit the ability of public sector unions, including teachers’ unions, to advocate for our members and students.\n- Destroys Bargaining Rights: Public employers can no longer negotiate contracts with unions after 2025.\n- Weakens Union Advocacy: By burdening unions with unnecessary red tape and cutting off school access, this bill makes it harder for unions to fight for students and educators.\n- Harms Students: Without strong unions, students lose critical advocates for funding, school safety, and quality education.\nWhy Should You Care?\nTeacher unions play a critical role in ensuring that educators can advocate for fair pay, benefits, and working conditions, which are essential for attracting and retaining quality educators. We also work tirelessly to improve classroom resources, reduce class sizes, and fight for equitable funding—all of which directly benefit Utah’s students.\nWeakening teacher unions is a step in the wrong direction. Instead, we should focus on strengthening our public schools by supporting educators and ensuring students have the resources they need to succeed.\nHB 267 (Sub 1) would eliminate bargaining rights for public employees, restrict our ability to represent public educators and prohibit using school property for union activities. These measures would silence public educators, worsen the teacher shortage, and undermine public education by targeting the very organizations that stand up for public schools and students.\nTell Gov. Cox to Veto HB 267\nThe Facts Speak for Themselves\nH.B. 267 Hurts Students\nStrong unions ensure smaller class sizes, higher-quality teaching, improved school safety, and better learning environments. This bill weakens unions, jeopardizing the quality of public education.\nTHE FACTS: States with strong teacher unions achieve better student outcomes, including higher graduation rates and improved test scores.\nRisk of Teacher Shortages\nIf passed, H.B. 267 (Sub 1) will make it harder to attract and retain top educators by removing their ability to negotiate fair pay and benefits. Utah already faces a teacher shortage—this bill will make it worse.\nTHE FACTS: States with weaker union protections experience higher teacher attrition rates and have more difficulty filling vacancies, especially in rural and underserved communities.\nEliminates Public School Advocacy\nWithout bargaining rights, educators and public workers lose their voice to advocate for students and families, particularly in underfunded schools. This bill silences those who know what public schools need most.\nTHE FACTS: Collective bargaining agreements often secure critical provisions, such as special education funding and resources for underserved schools.\nUnion Transparency is a Smokescreen\nThe new financial reporting requirements in H.B. 267 are designed to overwhelm unions with red tape. These measures do not benefit public educators but instead weaken their ability to organize and improve public education.\nTHE FACTS: The real intent of H.B. 267 is to weaken unions rather than improve transparency.\nTake Action Today\nYour voice is crucial in this fight.\n- Contact Your Legislators: Demand they vote NO on H.B. 267 Sub 1. Your voice will make a difference.\n- Share Your Story: Tell lawmakers how strong unions have positively impacted you or your community. Your voice matters.\n- Sign the Petition: Add your name to show your support for Utah educators and public schools.\n- Spread the Word: Share this page with your friends, family, and colleagues.

The political storm they stirred up is still raging as polarizing Governor Scott Walker faces a recall.\nA year ago this month, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker proposed a slate of changes to public-employee benefits, including sharply limiting government workers' right to bargain collectively. The action quickly provoked a firestorm. A hundred thousand protesters camped out at the capitol building in Madison; the minority Democrats in the state Senate fled the state to prevent the bill from passing.\nWalker got his changes through the state legislature anyway, but the fight wasn't over -- in fact, it was just beginning.\nIn Madison today, the reverberations of a year ago are still being felt. And for Walker, the determined, grandiose politician at the center of it all, the biggest battle still lies ahead: He is all but certain to face a tough recall election this summer.\nThe after-effects of the protests have been \"not so much a hangover as a bender,\" said Tom Holbrook, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.\nWalker's response has been to frame his recall as a referendum, not on his own leadership or the issue of public workers' rights and privileges, but on the very idea that any political leader can enact large-scale change. It is an odd, self-aggrandizing, and slightly bullying posture: He is daring voters to put up or shut up.\nWalker's plight mirrors Obama's. He campaigned on a platform of sweeping change, then proceeded to seek that change.\n\"Voters say they want leaders who are willing to make tough decisions, who aren't always worried about the next campaign,\" Walker told me in a recent interview. \"So my point is, if you have people who are willing to do those things, and ultimately that's what people say they want, then when elections like this come about, they need to stand with those elected officials who actually have the courage to take those actions.\"\nIn intriguing ways, Walker's plight mirrors Obama's. He campaigned on a platform of sweeping change (although, his opponents note, his platform did not specifically include collective bargaining alterations). Once elected with what he considered a mandate from voters, he proceeded to seek that change.\nEven his opponents agree Walker has been nothing if not bold. After the protests, the political storm continued to rage, but Walker staunchly refused to back down.\nIn short order after the demonstrations, a state Supreme Court election that was supposed to be a snoozer turned hotly contested, with millions spent on television ads by national groups on the left and right. (The Republican candidate prevailed.) Then the recalls started: Six Republican state senators and three Democrats faced voters in special elections in July and August; the Democrats netted two seats, short of the three they needed to take the senate.\nEven as Walker's reforms have inspired similar efforts in numerous other states, his hard-line conservative push has had another, unintended result: an upswell of progressive mobilization for economic fairness that can credibly claim to be a precursor of the Occupy Wall Street movement.\n\"It's a level of activism and involvement we haven't seen in decades,\" said Robert Kraig, executive director of the liberal coalition Citizen Action Wisconsin. As damaging as [Walker's actions] were, they created a movement -- a sense of community and mission that didn't exist a year ago.\"\nIn the face of this backlash, Walker, a former county administrator who never graduated from college, might have been expected to moderate and seek compromise. Quite the opposite -- he and the Republicans who still control both houses of the legislature pressed even harder.\nThey pushed through a GOP-friendly redistricting plan that's now tied up in court over allegations it was done illegally. Walker signed legislation on the hot-button issue of requiring photo identification to vote. A plan for major cuts to the state's popular health-care program, BadgerCare, is under consideration, and Walker is pushing for an iron mine in northwestern Wisconsin that environmentalists strongly oppose.\n\"His whole approach has been to double down -- to take a very strong, archconservative position and try to use his power to push it through,\" Kraig said. \"He could have probably gotten 75 percent of his agenda and not caused this mass movement against him if he hadn't taken on every single issue in this way.\"\nThe result, Kraig said, is a state of total, permanent partisan warfare in the capital, and an electorate that is split like never before. It's a sharp shift in what had been a fairly typical swing state that regularly elected both Democrats and Republicans to statewide office.\n\"According to polling, the whole state is extremely polarized,\" he said. \"Governor Walker is the most popular governor in the country among Republicans and the least popular among Democrats.\" A Marquette University Law School poll released this week measured Walker's approval rating at 46 percent favorable, 48 percent unfavorable.\nWalker rejects the idea that his actions have created a sharply divided electorate. \"Most of the people in our state, I've found, aren't particularly pumped up one way or another. They care more about what happens under the roof of their house than what happens under the dome of the capitol,\" he said.\nIf there is polarization, he says, it is the other side's fault: \"the national big government unions\" who \"poured tons of money\" into the state and \"ginned up their members\" with \"distortions\" of Walker's positions.\nThe unions and their allies have submitted a million signatures, nearly double the amount needed, for the Walker recall. A state board has undertaken a review of the petitions -- the process itself has, naturally, become contentious -- with the recall likely to be scheduled sometime between April and August. More legislator recalls also are in the works.\nAlready, Walker's campaign has spent about $7 million on television ads (outside groups that support him have poured in millions more). They are chiefly positive spots that feature Wisconsinites talking about how life has gotten better under his governorship.\nThis is why Walker predicts he will win: \"A year ago, the national unions came in and scared people into thinking the world was going to end. All these awful things were going to happen,\" he told me. \"A year later ... not only the sky didn't fall, things aren't bad like they predicted, [and] in many cases things are better.\" Unemployment is down, there have been no mass layoffs of teachers, most people's property taxes didn't go up. (You'll notice, though, that Walker doesn't claim he didn't raise taxes; rather, in his speeches, his claim is that he lowered the \"overall tax burden.\" That's because he raised taxes on some while lowering them on others, chiefly businesses.)\nWalker himself acknowledges now he could have done a better job introducing and making the case for his collective bargaining proposals, which were unveiled just six weeks into his governorship. But the problem was one of marketing, not policy, said Mark Graul, a Green Bay-based Republican consultant who ran the Bush-Cheney campaign in Wisconsin in 2004.\n\"The reforms that the governor made were ones that the public agreed with in concept,\" Graul said. \"That's what's been lost in all this. You're not going to see a single campaign ad run against Scott Walker saying public employees shouldn't have to pay more of their health care and retirement.\"\nIn Walker's telling, he never set out to be a provocateur. \"A year ago, I just saw a problem -- kind of like somebody coming in and taking over a small business -- I saw a problem, saw a solution and set out to fix it, never dreaming that it could draw national attention or have a national impact.\"\nNonetheless, Walker has become a national lightning rod -- a frequently featured villain in the broadcasts of liberal talk-show hosts like Rachel Maddow, Ed Schultz, and Keith Olbermann; a rockstar on the right who gets a hero's welcome from conservative audiences around the country, including at his recent dinner speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference.\nActivists on both sides -- the left with dread, the right with glee -- see in his weakening of public-sector unions the possibility of permanently disabling organized labor and with it the major engine of the Democratic Party. The Koch brothers, those liberal bogeymen, are a major patron of Walker's efforts. David Koch recently told the Palm Beach Post, \"What Scott Walker is doing with the public unions in Wisconsin is critically important. He's an impressive guy and he's very courageous. If the unions win the recall, there will be no stopping union power.\" The Koch-backed group Americans for Prosperity has a $700,000 ad buy on the air touting Walker's efforts.\nBut Walker insists his drive is not political. \"All we're doing is empowering workers. We're giving every public employee in our state the right to choose,\" he said. He declined to endorse the recent move to curtail union rights in Indiana, which this month became the first \"right-to-work\" state in the Rust Belt.\n\"In our case, we've opted to address [unions] on the public sector level,\" Walker said. \"You look at private sector unions by and large have been our partner in economic development. They haven't been an obstacle to that. So that's not anything we're pursuing.\"\nI asked if that meant he would oppose a right-to-work law for Wisconsin. \"Not oppose it, it's just not something we're pursuing right now,\" he said. \"When I was in the legislature, I supported it. It's not something I'm pursuing right now, nor have any plan of pursuing. Again, private-sector unions have been our partner in the economic revival we've had in this state. A bigger issue is the impact the public-sector unions have had on the taxpayers. And that's essentially what we have in Wisconsin -- right-to-work in the public sector.\" Walker's refusal to take a position on the issue, an apparent attempt to placate both the private unions that support him and his national right-wing base, was striking.\n\"If I end up losing a recall election, I think it sends a message — you know, don't bother taking on tough issues,\" Walker says.\nHandicapping the recall is tricky. Working against Walker: a highly motivated opposition, as evidenced by those million signatures, and voters' implacably entrenched views of him. Despite the millions he's spent already, his approval rating hasn't budged, and in the most recent poll actually declined.\n\"People made up their minds about Scott Walker in the first two months of his term,\" said one liberal operative working on the recall effort. \"All of this energy you've seen has been anger directed specifically against Scott Walker. People have been wanting to cast this vote for months.\"\nBut working in Walker's favor is the sheer amount of time that's elapsed since the protests, sapping some of his opponents' fervor. Democrats also must put up a candidate to oppose him and have no clear standard-bearer; three lesser-known figures have declared their candidacy, and a potentially divisive primary is expected.\nAs with Obama, Walker's decision to view his election as a sweeping mandate looks naive in retrospect. The fact that voters -- that is, humans -- tend, in practice, to find large-scale change disorienting and scary seems to have caught him by surprise.\nAnd so Walker has tried to remind his constituents that all along, he has only been doing what, in his mind at least, they said they wanted when they elected him.\n\"If I or a majority of senators end up losing a recall election, I think it sends a message -- in my statehouse, but I think it sends a message elsewhere and I think it certainly sends a message in our nation's capital -- you know, don't bother taking on tough issues,\" he told me. \"Don't make tough decisions, even if you know that they're the right thing to do long-term, because in the short term, you're going to lose an election. They're going to target you. They're going to come after you. That's where I think, when I talk in terms of courage, that's what I think is ultimately at stake.\"\nImages: Darren Hauck / Reuters\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Robin L. Webb, R-Grayson, shared her thoughts on what she learned as co-chair of the Disaster Prevention and Resiliency Task Force while giving an overview on the group’s 2026 legislative recommendations.\nWebb said the first recommendation is for Kentucky to establish a state resiliency office.\n“It would be a coordinating body for preparedness, resilience and mitigation efforts,” she said.\nWebb said the resiliency office would collect data and track how disaster recovery and resiliency efforts are expended and what resources are available. Additionally, the office would also focus on urban planning, structures, transportation projects and mitigation efforts.\n“Just agencies talking to one another and sharing maps and sharing data and talking to one another on a regular basis – that’s what I envision for the state resilience office,” Webb added.\nThe second recommendation from the task force is to continue to meet and study disaster prevention and resiliency in 2026.\n“Whether it’s a task force like we’re doing now or oversight committee or a regular committee, whatever that form is, the general assembly needs to be involved,” Webb said.\nThis year, the task force learned about ways Kentucky can improve building code policy, water level monitoring systems and other disaster preparedness efforts. Webb said the task force is recommending the general assembly “make the expenditures necessary” to address those concerns.\nProviding displaced Kentuckians shelter following a natural disaster is also something that needs to be improved, Webb said. A community-based approach, rather than utilizing Kentucky State Parks lodging facilities, will be recommended.\nGrowing urban search and rescue and swift water rescue teams, investing in disaster mitigation efforts and increasing public education and awareness are also recommendations of the task force, Webb said.\nCo-chair Rep. Chris Freeland, R-Benton, said local, long-term recovery groups is another effort the task force is going to recommend supporting.\nFreeland believes only 13 Kentucky counties have a long-term recovery group, with Mayfield – the site of the deadly 2021 tornado – being one of them.\n“We need every county to do that, all 120, to have long-term recovery groups because they can’t accept any donations or do the things that they need until they have that,” Freeland said, adding that expanding access to case management for survivors, streamlining benefit verification and reducing duplication of services are also priorities.\nFreeland said the task force has “barely scratched the surface” on what more can be done to improve disaster prevention and resiliency in Kentucky. He hopes the task force can continue next year and that the general assembly will consider some of the task force’s recommendations.\n“Since 2020, billions of dollars in damage has been done, and if we can invest a little bit of money and a lot of effort, I think we can do a lot of things to help Kentucky and to help the people here,” Freeland said.\nRep. Mitch Whitaker, R-Fleming-Neon, said he believes the resiliency office recommendation is “critically important.”\n“I know that most of us here, if not all of us, would consider ourselves fiscal conservatives and creating a new division of government always makes people feel a little uneasy,” Whitaker said. But when you’re looking at the cost of rebuilding time after time, the cost of preparation and resiliency will save our commonwealth so much money in the long run.”\nThe task force unanimously adopted its list of recommendations. Friday was the last day the task force was scheduled to meet in 2025.\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot take action on legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nFRANKFORT — The Hatfield-McCoy Feud Trail is important not only for its history, but also for tourism dollars the popular sites generate in Eastern Kentucky, according to testimony to a state committee Thursday.\nThree advocates – Bob Scott, Tony K. Tackett and Jay Shepherd – from Pikeville-Pike County Tourism testified to the Interim Joint Committee on Tourism, Small Business, and Information Technology about the significance of signage and tourism growth in the area.\n“The visitors to the Hatfield-McCoy area increase every year by the thousands,” said Tackett, a descendant of the Hatfield family.\nBut even some residents may not know much history about the Hatfields and McCoys, he said. Sometimes GPS devices and cell phones won’t work in the area, and that’s one reason why signs are needed, Tackett said.\n“The cell signal just does not get down in there, and people are lost. They spend most of their time running around looking for the sites,” he said.\nShepherd said signage is needed along US Route 119 and State Highways 319 and 1056. He said strategic signage would not only help people find their way around the area, but also help market the sites.\nAccording to the presentation, tourists spent $72.93 million in Pike County in 2017. That number rose to $114.6 million in 2024.\n“Does this replace the coal mining industry that has kind of fell apart in our region? No. But does it offset a lot of issues economically in our region? Absolutely,” Shepherd said. “It’s one leg of many legs that we need to explore in making Pike County economically strong. And it also helps in tax revenues as well, obviously.”\nCommittee Co-Chair Sen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, described the Hatfields and McCoys as having the most famous and perhaps infamous history in Eastern Kentucky.\nRep. Ryan Dotson, R-Winchester, noted that he’s related to both families and grew up in the area.\n“Growing up there, that was just a story that we were always told. We understood the story but didn’t really know the significance of it until we got out of the area. When I got in the Army, everybody talked about the Hatfields and McCoys. Traveled the world – everybody talked about the Hatfields and McCoys. So I think this is long overdue,” he said.\nRep. Mitch Whitaker, R-Fleming-Neon, said he’s very proud to represent part of Pike County – the history, the geography and the people. He asked the trio if lodging is sufficient in the area and if the area is falling behind surrounding states.\n“I know we want to work collaboratively, but at the same time, we have to make sure that Kentucky dollars circulate in Kentucky as much as possible,” he said.\nScott said a new hotel is expected to be constructed in Pikeville within the next three years and there does need to be more signage, lodging and marketing.\n“It’s about keeping the mom and pop alive. We can keep them alive. We’ll be good,” Scott said.\nTackett said that the allure of knowing more about the Hatfields and McCoys exists.\n“We’re sitting on an opportunity with this because for some reason, people love the word Hatfield and McCoys. It’s either the feudin’, the fussin’ or it’s kind of like Romeo and Juliet. It’s also a love story,” he said.\nFRANKFORT — The Artificial Intelligence Task Force 2025 on Thursday advanced recommendations for the Kentucky General Assembly to consider during the upcoming legislative session – a main goal of the group.\nCo-Chairs Rep. Josh Bray, R-Mount Vernon, and Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, R-Lexington, outlined the 10 recommendations during the panel’s last meeting before the session kicks off in January.\n“We tried to incorporate everybody’s recommendation. Some of them are federal issues that would be more appropriate there, and so we’ve got a recommendation of that. But thank you to everyone who sent those in,” Bray said.\nAmong the recommendations, the task force is asking lawmakers to consider changes to state law that would strengthen protections for consumer data as artificial intelligence – known as AI – continues to evolve.\nThe panel also recommends that lawmakers consider updates to AI policies for state agencies along with stronger policies to protect minors on social media from the potential effects of AI.\nAnother recommendation seeks acknowledgement that AI may impact careers, and the task force is asking lawmakers to collaborate with professional standards boards regarding the use of AI in certain professions.\nA full list of the recommendations is available here.\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald L. Thomas, D-Lexington, said the section on minors is an excellent recommendation because it promotes online safety for children and parents. He said he hopes the legislature will take action during the session on the issue.\n“We see every day here in America discussions of sexual exploitation of minors, sexual trafficking of minors. We know it occurs with a great deal of frequency. And AI is out here every day causing harm and danger to our children,” he said.\nThomas added that two other recommendations dealing with data centers are important and data centers should not be built in Kentucky without an environmental impact survey. He cited concerns about how power usage by data centers could impact people and businesses already on the electrical grid.\n“I don’t think that that cost should be passed on to the current users of that electrical system,” he said. “I think if there’s an increased cost that comes with data center construction or use, then that data center should pay for that increased cost, not the current consumers or the current business users who were using it before the data center came online.”\nThe recommendations call on lawmakers to consider polices related to the location of data centers in Kentucky and their use of water and power resources.\nBray said Thomas’s concerns are why those sections were drafted. He recalled past solar legislation that dealt with similar issues.\n“If you’ll remember the solar bill that passed a few years ago, it provided minimum requirements on setbacks, on decommissioning bonds, making sure that if a solar farm were to be decommissioned, there was money there to make it right so that local landowners wouldn’t be tasked with that,” he said.\nBray said the Kentucky Public Service Commission completes a grid usage study regarding capacity and availability when a large user seeks approval. He agreed that lawmakers do not want electric bills to increase due to power consumption from a data center.\n“We’ve had a lot of conversation with power companies, data centers, the Public Service Commission, so there will be a bill coming to address those exact concerns,” Bray said.\nSen. Gex Williams, R-Verona, pointed to one recommendation that would incorporate AI development and governance into the jurisdiction of legislative committees. He said the jurisdiction should fall under the Natural Resources and Energy Committee.\n“There’s a one-to-one relationship between data centers and energy,” he said.\nThe general assembly created the task force to study the use of AI throughout Kentucky to foster innovation and competitiveness, to promote AI literacy and to ensure AI development and governance in Kentucky, including data centers.\nMays Bledsoe said the task force has been a “wonderful tool” for the last two years, educating legislators and offering a path forward toward a long-term plan.\n“It’s been a really good committee, and I’ve been really grateful for our conversations,” she said.\nFRANKFORT — In its final meeting of 2025, the Commission on Race and Access to Opportunity heard testimony Wednesday on legislation that would create a trust fund for juvenile justice-related services.\nCommission member Sen. Keturah J. Herron, D-Louisville, said she plans to file Bill Request 1218 next year, which is similar to legislation she filed when she served in the Kentucky House of Representatives.\nHerron said she noticed during her term in the House that funding for facilities was typically at the forefront of the juvenile justice conversation.\n\"What I realized was that we are looking to put a lot of money into facilities, but we were not putting money on the backside, or I guess upstream, for prevention, intervention and reentry,\" she said.\nUnder BR 1218, Herron originally proposed a $9.6 million allocation to a Juvenile Services Fund within the Department of Juvenile Justice. Larry Forester, a citizen member of the commission, suggested Herron round the $9.6 million allocation to $10 million, which she agreed to.\nThe funding would come from state appropriations, gifts, grants and federal funds, according to the bill draft.\nHerron said the fund would create a consistent source of money at the state level for delinquency prevention and early intervention services, wraparound services, and alternative detention and reentry programs.\nHerron told the committee she is already aware of organizations across the state that are providing some of these services that could use more support.\n\"I think if we as a state, if we're putting all this money into facilities, it is our job as well to help on the backside of that,\" she added.\nHerron said she hopes the proposed legislation can be part of the solution when it comes to improving the lives of Kentucky's youth and addressing juvenile justice issues.\n\"It's not going to be the sole answer for the issues that we have, but I do think that it is one piece in part of the solutions we can do,\" she said.\nCommission co-chair Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, R-Lexington, asked Herron if a national nonprofit would be able to donate to the fund and then Kentucky organizations could apply for grants from that fund.\nHerron said yes. She also added she would also like to see the state get creative with the request for proposal (RFP) process by looking at a particular issue for a particular county and issuing a specific RFP for that issue and location.\nOne example Herron gave was suicide prevention services for youth in Northern Kentucky.\n\"It's a very innovative way to address all of these different issues through this,\" she said.\nCitizen Member Kimberly Baird asked Herron to clarify who might qualify to receive a grant from the trust fund and who would oversee the distribution of the funds.\nHerron said she thinks the Juvenile Justice Oversight Council would be useful to help inform the department on how to distribute the funds to any type of local government entity, law enforcement entity, nonprofit groups or school districts.\nMays Bledsoe thanked Herron for her work on the legislation.\n\"It's really interesting and definitely innovative and creative,\" Mays Bledsoe said. \"It's a tough problem, and you've seen it throughout the commonwealth.\"\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot take action on new legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nA copy of Herron's proposed legislation can be found here.\nFRANKFORT — A proposed job training and education center in Boyle County for Kentucky inmates could help further reduce the state's recidivism rate, according to supporters.\nRep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, and Sen. Brandon J. Storm, R-London, introduced the idea to the Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary on Thursday. Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS) President Ryan Quarles and Director of Reentry Services with the Kentucky Department of Corrections Kirstin Porter joined them.\nDecker credits KCTCS's current partnership with the Department of Corrections for the recent drop in Kentucky's recidivism rate.\nThe college system already has nine colleges working with 14 state-run correctional facilities, one federal prison and numerous local jails on GED, associate and bachelor's degrees, and vocational job training, Quarles said.\nDecker told the committee they would like to keep working together on recidivism and workforce participation by opening a model campus at a state prison for 400 vetted inmates to enroll in intensive education and vocational programs near their scheduled release dates.\n\"Every Kentuckian has a stake in this fight against recidivism, regardless of any personal ties to incarceration,\" Decker said. \"Because when inmates return home with proven skills, they are far more likely to stay out of prison in the future, to contribute to their communities and to ensure safer neighborhoods for all Kentuckians.\"\nDecker said Kentucky defines recidivism as reincarceration within 24 months of release. Kentucky's recidivism rate dropped earlier this year by 1.6 points to 30.81%, but if measured by the national standard of three years, Kentucky's recidivism rate is much higher, she said.\n\"(It's) a standard that measures Kentucky's rate of recidivism as being 40.2% higher than any border state, but declining faster than the U.S. average,\" Decker added.\nThe program proposed by Decker, Storm, Quarles and Porter on Thursday is modeled after a successful program in Michigan called Vocational Village, where the state has seen a 50% drop in recidivism, Quarles said.\nQuarles said they are proposing a KCTCS reentry campus at the North Point Training Center in Boyle County due to its already existing partnerships and prison education programs.\n\"We're building upon a model that's working in Michigan, and we think we can do it right here in Kentucky as well,\" he added.\nStorm told the committee the program would enhance public safety and would be a fiscally responsible program for the commonwealth to pursue.\nRep. T.J. Roberts, R-Burlington, said he appreciates the mission of the proposed program. He asked which criminal offenses would make an inmate ineligible.\nQuarles said a list has not been finalized, but he knows Michigan does not allow sex offenders to enroll in a Vocational Village due to it being difficult for sex offenders to find employment.\nSen. Michael J. Nemes, R-Shepherdsville, said he believes the proposed program is needed, along with some other reentry-related legislation. He said some inmates are having trouble completing the required apprenticeship programs in order to earn a vocational certification.\nQuarles said the enabling legislation the group is working on can address those needs.\n\"One of the things that we want to be clear about is that this is not a criminal justice reform bill,\" Quarles said. \"This is about workforce and for those inmates that we know will be released having the best chance possible.\"\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot take action on new legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nFRANKFORT — Kentucky may join its neighbors next year in implementing hands-free driving legislation.\nSen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, told the Interim Joint Committee on Transportation on Tuesday he plans to file South Carolina's version of the hands-free driving bill in 2026. Higdon also serves as co-chair of the committee.\nThis is not the first time Higdon has sponsored this type of legislation.\n\"The proposed legislation would close current loopholes by requiring hands-free technology for cellphones be used while driving,\" Higdon said, adding he believes this version would address some concerns other lawmakers had about previous drafts of the bill.\nDistraction-free driving advocate Alyssa Burns testified in-favor of the legislation alongside Higdon. In 2022, Burns's daughter Camberleigh was killed when a distracted driver struck their vehicle in Louisville. She was 13 days away from turning 2.\nBurns said their vehicle was at a complete stop in a construction zone, and Camberleigh was properly restrained in her car seat when the collision happened. She said the driver of the other vehicle admitted he was distracted.\n\"We'll never know her full potential because of a reckless driver, who, by the way, was not prosecuted only because he said he wasn't paying attention,\" Burns said. \"He had no drugs in his system. He had no alcohol.\"\nHigdon told the committee that around 20% of Kentucky's 814 vehicle collision fatalities in 2023 were caused by distracted driving.\nUnder Bill Request 238, or the Phone-Down Kentucky Act, drivers would be prohibited from using any part of their body to use a mobile electronic device while driving.\nHidgon said the legislation defines a mobile electronic device as a cell phone, portable computer, GPS, electronic gaming system, or any device used to communicate, display or record digital content. The bill includes exceptions for certain radio communication devices and if a driver needs to report an emergency, accident or safety hazard.\n\"Kentucky remains to be one of the few states without a comprehensive handheld phone ban, despite rising fatalities,\" Higdon said.\nBR 238 would require violators pay a $100 fine. Collected fines would be distributed to the traumatic brain injury trust fund, the Kentucky trauma care system fund and the veterans' program trust fund, Higdon said.\nHe told the committee he believes reducing fatalities is a \"winnable battle.\"\n\"We can with this piece of legislation,\" Higdon added.\nSen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, said he is \"happy to lend his support\" to Higdon's legislation, but would like to see a community service requirement added to the penalty provision.\n\"I do think that sometimes people make mistakes, but to make them go through and have some part of this where they have to spend some time either working on cases or seeing the results of their actions, maybe the first time we catch somebody, we help them never do this again,\" Smith said.\nRep. Anne Gay Donworth, D-Lexington, said she also supports the legislation, but has concerns about an officer being able to catch a violator in the act.\n\"I would encourage some other opportunities for enforcement,\" she said.\nHigdon said he believes the legislative process would create an opportunity for Donworth to suggest that change.\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot take action on new legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nA draft of Higdon's proposed legislation can be found here.\nFRANKFORT — Two lawmakers joined with advocates from the mental health profession on Tuesday, urging the Interim Joint Committee on Banking and Insurance to support proposed legislation that seeks to improve mental health parity in insurance.\nRep. Vanessa Grossl, R-Georgetown, and Rep. Lisa Willner, D-Louisville, testified in support of the measure along with Sheila Schuster, chair of the Kentucky Mental Health Coalition, and Nicole Sartini, president of Bridge Counseling and Wellness in Louisville.\n\"The Kentucky General Assembly has recognized mental health as an issue for a number of years, and mental health needs to remain a priority for us,\" Grossl told the committee.\nShe said a measure from 2021 required insurers to treat mental health the same as physical health, and \"we're here today to discuss fidelity issues with that law to ensure that insurers are following the law with fidelity and that proper enforcement mechanisms are in place for those who do not.\"\nGrossl said the Kentucky Department of Insurance's ability to implement the current law has drawn concern.\n\"Reports from the department have not addressed mental health parity nor did last month's department update testimony to this committee. We believe additional legislative oversight is warranted,\" she said. \"At this point, we should have already been presented with two full years' worth of data via those annual reporting requirements that the bill clarified for insurers.\"\nThe proposed legislation would give oversight and enforcement capabilities to the legislature and the Kentucky Office of the Attorney General. It would also support consumers and providers with an advisory committee of experts in the field that reports to the attorney general, Grossl said.\nThe proposed legislation can be found here.\nWillner, a licensed psychologist, said the bill is fully bipartisan.\n\"That's because mental health care is not a partisan issue,\" she said, noting similar legislation from last year.\n\"I also want to point out that the bill is watermarked ‘draft,' so this is very much a work in progress.\"\nWillner said there has been significant policy progress on behavioral health parity in Kentucky and federally, but enforcement and situations providers face remain significant challenges.\n\"Access to in-network behavioral health services remains significantly less than access to in-network medical and surgical treatments,\" she said.\nThe federal 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addictions Equity Act requires that health plans not design or apply financial requirements or treatment limitations differently for behavioral health than they would be for comparable medical or surgical benefits, but the burdens remain in Kentucky and federally, Willner said.\nSeveral legislators had questions for the individuals who testified. One of them was Sen. Julie Raque Adams, R-Louisville, who asked about mental health professionals who receive claw backs from insurers.\n\"Do you have to have any sort of pre-authorization before you administer services,\" she asked.\nSartini said her practice provides outpatient services and deals with fewer pre-authorizations than others.\n\"We're seeing that these are happening sometimes because someone has a primary insurance and then they also have a secondary insurance. And even though we are billing under the primary insurance, there's a conflict that sometimes causes claw backs, and no one will agree to pay for it,\" she said.\nRep. Adrielle Camuel, D-Lexington, said mental health parity is a complicated issue, and she respects mental health professionals but has concerns that the proposed legislation in its current form doesn't open avenues for access to care.\nRep. Jim Gooch Jr., R-Providence, said it sounds reasonable that there should be mental health parity, but he thinks the mental health industry \"over compensates, over treats, over prescribes.\" He said many children are diagnosed with a condition that schools must approach like a disability.\n\"Now the educators have to look at them and consider their disability in how they accept behavior… because their disability may cause some particular action or some way they act out,\" he said.\nRep. Chad Aull, D-Lexington, asked about a projected $300,000 cost in the proposed legislation.\nGrossl said it's preliminarily to hire two paralegals for the attorney general's office to ensure due diligence is met.\nSchuster said unless the legislature acts to ensure insurers follow rules, mental health and addiction problems won't be solved in Kentucky.\n\"Very few people are willing to admit that they, or someone in their family, has a mental health or addictive disorder that's going to need insurance. That's what stigma does, and it's still alive and well,\" she said.\nLegislators can't act on proposed legislation until the 2026 Regular Session begins in January.\nFRANKFORT — The Interim Joint Committee on Health Services on Wednesday received an update on medical cannabis dispensaries in the commonwealth.\nSenate Bill 47, adopted in 2023, called on the state Cabinet for Health and Family Services to implement, oversee and regulate a medical cannabis program in Kentucky for individuals with certain health disorders. The legislation designated 2025 as the first year of the program.\nCannon Armstrong, executive director of the state Office of Medical Cannabis, said most program practitioners are advanced practice registered nurses and medical doctors. There are 78 counties represented by practitioners throughout the state and multiple practitioners in some of those counties.\nAccording to the Office of Medical Cannabis, which operates under the auspices of the health cabinet, medical cannabis is \"a written certification-based product from the flowers of the Cannabis sativa L. plant. Armstrong said qualifying conditions for obtaining the product include cancer, chronic pain, chronic nausea, multiple sclerosis, post traumatic stress disorder and seizure disorder.\nChronic pain and PTSD are the two most common qualifying conditions now, Armstrong said.\nCommittee Co-Chair Rep. Kimberly Poore Moser, R-Taylor Mill, asked officials about a $25 fee that has been waived for patients who were approved to receive a medical cannabis card.\nArmstrong said waiving the fee was one of the only ways officials could reduce costs for cardholders.\n\"As you know, this medication is not going to be covered by insurance, so they're still going to have to pay their practitioners to see them too, and that's not something that we have the ability to waive or be involved in in regard to the actual practitioner fee from our office,\" he said.\nArmstrong mentioned a dispensary in Ohio County – The Post Dispensary. According to the dispensary's website, the facility is expected to open this fall, and it is the state's first fully approved medical cannabis dispensary.\nOther dispensaries are following suit, he said.\n\"Forty-six of our 48 dispensaries are in their forever homes. They've found their permanent locations. We have two more that still need to be settled, but we're working on that. We should have those done before the end of the year,\" Armstrong said.\nRep. Robert Duvall, R-Bowling Green, asked if any investigations have occurred outside the application review to determine if the applicant or license winner has infrastructure, personnel and capital to operate on the first day of business.\nScotty McFarlan, deputy executive director of the Office of Medical Cannabis, said for a license to be issued, the applicant must meet all the requirements in the application process. He said the office's enforcement division is answering questions and helping applicants throughout the process.\nRep. Scott Sharp, R-Ashland, said he has heard about applicants who have rented out a single residence and filed multiple applications to operate a dispensary under varying company names. He asked if officials at the Office of Medical Cannabis have checked on this issue.\nArmstrong answered no, not at this time.\n\"I would recommend considering that,\" Sharp answered.\nSen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, Sen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, and Moser voiced concerns about the characteristics of cannabis gummies, especially appearance. Armstrong said the actual gummies are expected to be colored.\n\"The Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Panel met yesterday and, once again, the majority of cases that we heard were ingesting cases from children – some of them THC,\" Carroll said. He called colored gummies a \"terrible mistake.\"\nArmstrong said packing for gummies will be child resistant, require a two-step process for the initial opening and will include a tamper-evident seal that is resealable.\n\"We're also doing an outreach regarding this topic, including where it should be stored in homes like other prescription medications are,\" Armstrong said.\nBerg said the gummies need to look like medicine, because they're being treated as medicine.\nHouse Minority Whip Lindsey Burke, D-Lexington, said she is highly optimistic about the program and how it can improve patients' lives. She said distributors, growers and dispensary owners have provided positive feedback, calling Kentucky's program one of the best in the country.\n\"The thoughtfulness of the regulations, the way that this has been structured, makes them feel confident that they are able to do business in a way that is safe, is well-regulated,\" she said. \"They feel confident that they're going to be able to help Kentucky patients without exposing children, and I think that's important to everyone in this room,\" she said.\nFRANKFORT — The Kentucky Housing Task Force 2025 heard testimony Tuesday on using land owned by religious institutions to build affordable housing.\nThis isn't the first time lawmakers have proposed the idea. But Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, and Rep. Michael Sarge Pollock, R-Campbellsville, hope their legislation will become law during the upcoming legislation session, which kicks off Jan. 6.\n\"We started it in the Senate last year and passed it out of the Senate with ease. It was well accepted and got to the House, and I won't say it had a lot of opposition, but a lot of questions,\" Higdon said, noting that Pollock will reintroduce the bill in the House next year.\nHigdon said the proposal is still a work in progress after he and Pollock were invited to meet with the Sisters of Loretto, a religious community based in Marion County.\nTwo nuns from the community knew about legislation filed in the U.S. Senate and broached the idea with the Kentucky legislators. Similar legislation also has been proposed in other states, Higdon said.\nHigdon said the concept allows religious institutions to bypass some local zoning rules and build affordable housing on church property.\nZoning laws are restrictive and deal with things such as square footage, parking, lot size, single family housing and multi-family housing, he said.\n\"This bill simply lets them bypass most of those too. They have to follow building codes, and the final phase of it before it can be built, it has to be approved by the local governing body,\" Higdon said.\nPollock said when the bill came to the House last year, it was more broad than desired, and the short legislative session didn't allow time for the bill to be passed.\nThe proposal is expected to be \"tweaked\" a bit, and commercial zones would be the main target for religious institution land use, Pollock said.\n\"We're here today to ask for this task force to endorse our bill this upcoming session,\" he said.\nRep. Joshua Watkins, D-Louisville, thanked Higdon and Pollock for their legislation. He said he has heard from those involved with religious institutions in his district and others parts of Jefferson County who strongly support the developments.\n\"I'm a big supporter of it. Can't wait to see it in the House again,\" Watkins said.\nTask Force Co-Chair Rep. Susan Witten, R-Louisville, also thanked Higdon and Pollock for their bill. She asked what would happen if religious institutions want to transfer their property to a non-religious institution.\nHigdon said the issue is still being considered as lawmakers look to return with the bill next year.\nThe next meeting of the task force is scheduled for Nov. 24 at 1 p.m.\nFRANKFORT — Two Kentucky lawmakers are hoping 2026 will be the year a bill to remove the state mandate for fluoride in Kentucky's drinking water crosses the finish line.\nRep. Mark Hart, R-Falmouth, has filed legislation similar to House Bill 16 from the 2025 legislative session nine times, he said. The bill did not become law this year, but did receive House approval.\nOn Tuesday, Hart was joined by Sen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester, and other stakeholders at the Interim Joint Committee on State Government meeting to testify on a new version of HB 16.\nHart plans to carry the bill in the House, and Elkins said he would file companion legislation in the Senate next year.\n\"The legislation simply undoes the unfunded mandate in the state of Kentucky that requires water producers to add fluoride to the water,\" Hart said.\nThe newer version of the legislation from Hart would protect local water districts from civil and criminal liability, he said. The decision to add this provision to the bill is the result of conversations with water districts.\n\"One of the biggest concerns we heard was they were worried about possible litigation,\" Hart said. \"Doesn't matter whether they keep fluoride in water or take it out, they are afraid they're going to be sued with whatever decision is made.\"\nDr. Jack Kall, a dentist and the executive chair of the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology, shared scientific studies with the committee that show water fluoridation might cause lower IQ in children, among other health concerns.\nKall said the fluoride in most toothpaste and other fluoride treatments administered by dentists are sufficient in preventing tooth decay.\nHart said his legislation is an effort to make water fluoridation a local decision in light of newer studies on the risks and benefits of water fluoridation.\n\"We're not promoting fluoride one way or another – good or bad,\" Hart said. \"We're trying to steer away from that conversation, because that's not what the legislation does. However, with some of the stuff in the media today, we thought it was necessary to give you a little bit of an education on the risks and benefits for it.\"\nElkins said he considers the proposed legislation to be \"permissive\" rather than a requirement.\n\"It's more of a local control bill to me than anything else,\" he said.\nIn commenting on the proposed legislation, Rep. Matthew Lehman, D-Newport, said all of the countries that do not have water fluoridation mentioned in Kall's presentation have \"robust, publicly funded dental programs.\"\nHe wondered if Kentucky should be funding water fluoridation and other dental health initiatives instead of leaving water fluoridation as an unfunded state mandate.\nRep. T.J. Roberts, R-Burlington, said he's received multiple messages asking him to oppose legislation that removes community water fluoridation programs, but he believes the proposed legislation is more about local control.\n\"This is a good piece of legislation that expands the ability for community-based decision making,\" Roberts said. \"I think it's backed up by data, and I fully support this.\"\nIn a continuation of the local control discussion, Rep. James Tipton, R-Taylorsville, asked Hart if the new version of HB 16 would require a public hearing. Hart said no, but he wouldn't be opposed.\n\"Maybe you might consider something like that to just make sure that the local people in the local communities are informed, and they have an opportunity to (provide) input on decisions of their local water district board,\" Tipton said.\nSen. Steve Rawlings, R-Burlington, said he would support the proposed legislation.\n\"I would also be supportive of a total ban, as Florida and Utah have done to date,\" he added.\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot take action on new legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nA draft of Hart's proposed legislation can be found here.\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on State Government meeting is scheduled for Nov. 13 at 3 p.m.\nFRANKFORT — A proposed House bill would seek to make housing more accessible for some renters who have been named in dismissed eviction cases.\nRep. Susan Witten, R-Louisville, told the Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary on Thursday that she plans to refile House Bill 534 from the 2025 legislative session in 2026.\nDismissed evictions would be automatically sealed and would not appear on a renter's record under the proposed legislation. The bill would also create a process for expunging the names of children from eviction records.\n\"This bill is important as it increases the ability for working Kentuckians to have access to safe, affordable housing, while explicitly maintaining the property rights of the landlord,\" Witten said. \"This bill makes no change to the eviction collection or damage claims property owners may have. It also enhances access in rental markets by ensuring the records used are actually accurate.\"\nWitten said the legislation is the result of the Kentucky Housing Task Force.\n\"For the past two years, we've worked really hard to try to identify state-level solutions to Kentucky's housing crisis,\" she said. \"While most of the solutions that we have identified address the housing on the supply side, there are other solutions that we have identified that can help eliminate unnecessary road blocks for Kentuckians to have access to housing, especially affordable housing.\"\nGeorge Eklund, director of education and advocacy for the Coalition for the Homeless – Louisville, told the committee Kentucky's main driver of eviction is the state's lack of housing. He said Kentucky is short around 210,000 units.\nIf a landlord decides to sell a property and requires the tenant to leave the property, sometimes the tenant has nowhere else to go.\n\"Because of our tight rental market, (the tenant) can't find a place to move to, and so the landlord is left with one option and that is to file an eviction,\" Eklund said.\nInability to pay is another main cause for eviction.\n\"Six out of every 10 low-income Kentuckians are already spending more than 50% of their wages on rent,\" Eklund said.\nOne small financial disaster, like an unexpected expense or a missed paycheck due to illness, can set tenants back months on rent, he added.\nEklund said statistics show 60% of renters resolve their eviction notice and have the case dismissed. Kentucky Administrative Office of the Courts data shows 110 out of Kentucky's 120 counties have fewer than 16 dismissed evictions a month.\nEklund said he and Witten have been working with the county court clerks to make sure the bill would be easy to implement.\n\"Luckily for us is that (the legislature) has created an automatic expungement process for dismissed criminal actions, so this is hopefully something that we could emulate as we put this into action,\" Eklund said.\nWitten said she wanted to reiterate to the committee that her proposed bill would maintain a landlord's right to screen tenants based on legal criteria, like proof of income or credit checks.\n\"They can still file evictions,\" Witten said. \"They can still collect unpaid rent, and they can still pursue legal claims or seek charges for property damage.\"\nSen. Michael J. Nemes, R-Shepherdsville, said he did have reservations about the legislation at first. As a landlord, he wants to know if a tenant was kicked out for nonpayment. He also wants to ensure landlords could still seek out missed payments and reimbursement for damages if needed.\nWitten said the legislation would not prevent a landlord from seeking a small claims action or sending debt off to collections.\nNemes said he is in support of removing dismissed evictions from someone's record in the event they fall on hard times, are unable to pay but then are able to resolve the issue.\nRep. Stephanie Dietz, R-Edgewood, and Rep. Nima Kulkarni, D-Louisville, were co-sponsors of Witten's bill this year.\nDietz said the legislation would help single parents struggling financially due to a missed child support or spousal support payment.\n\"I think this will help some of those single parents, so they're not living in a hotel, paying a weekly amount when they could be getting a rental and putting their family in a home,\" she said, adding she looks forward to being a primary co-sponsor of the legislation again in 2026.\nKulkarni said the bill addresses a \"very real, tangible\" barrier to housing and proposes an easy solution.\n\"This is, just to my mind, very low-hanging fruit, and it would help a lot of families avoid being homeless,\" she said.\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot act on legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nA draft of HB 534 can be found here.\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary meeting is scheduled for 11 a.m. on Nov. 6.\nFRANKFORT — Legislators on the Interim Joint Committee on Tourism, Small Business and Information Technology on Thursday received an overview from stakeholders about the status of Kentucky's tourism industry.\nHank Phillips, president and chief executive officer of the Frankfort-based Kentucky Travel Industry Association, said the state of tourism in Kentucky is very strong.\n\"When we talk about the strength of tourism, the way we define that is in terms of the benefits that tourism provides to the people of Kentucky and the communities of Kentucky. Examples of that: over $14 billion in economic impact from tourism, the support of nearly 100,000 jobs by tourism and the contribution of a billion dollars in local and state tax revenue,\" he said.\nThe quality of life is another important facet of tourism. The experiences provided for tourists also benefit Kentuckians, he said.\n\"That's a huge consideration by businesses in decisions to relocate to Kentucky and by families considering moving to Kentucky and working here,\" he said.\nPrakash T. Maggan, an executive with Lexington-based Rainmaker Hospitality, also testified and said the company operates 24 hotels in Kentucky and four in Ohio.\n\"While our industry came back from COVID much more quickly and much more strongly than anybody would have ever anticipated, we are now seeing a lot of headwinds in our industry,\" he said.\nMaggan said the state transient tax and ensuing advertising it funds are vital to the tourism industry.\n\"And we want to make sure that that funding continues to support our local tourism offices. We need to make sure that they have all of the resources necessary to show off the attractions and natural resources in our state,\" he said.\nLori Murphy-Tatum, tourism director for the City of Richmond, said the 1% funds are vital for the state's department of tourism. She added that some people associated with Airbnb short-term rentals are not paying the local transient tax.\n\"We are funded through transient tax. So, we get that from our hoteliers, from our bed and breakfasts and our short-term rentals,\" she said.\nRep. Shane Baker, R-Somerset, asked if people are still coming to Kentucky but not staying in hotels.\nMaggan said officials have seen a slowdown this year.\n\"We just want to make sure that, as the economic climate gets tougher for everybody, we're continuing as best in our industry and giving us the best possible chance to come out with a recovery on the other end because, as all cycles go, we will have a rising tide again,\" he said.\nRep. Adam Moore, D-Lexington, asked about the role artificial intelligence is starting to play in tourism.\n\"One of the things with AI, as you know, it is combing the internet for every bit of information that it can find. And that's why it's so important on the back end, on your local tourism offices and even with the state,\" Murphy-Tatum said. \"We're spending a lot more time going into our websites, going into Google and fact checking everything that we can find and make sure that's correct.\"\nSen. Matt Nunn, R-Sadieville, asked if local tourism offices could have more discretion about what type of projects they can fund. He pointed to a volunteer rescue service in Red River Gorge.\n\"I can't help but think that the local tourism office might be interested in funding some of those needs because likely a lot of those people that get rescued by that service are tourists there rock climbing,\" he said.\nMurphy-Tatum said those who serve on commission boards by state law decide how the money is spent, and attracting people to Kentucky is paramount.\nRep. Matthew Lehman, D-Newport, asked how important the bourbon industry in Kentucky is now and does the state need to diversify.\nPhillips said that from a tourism perspective, bourbon is huge, but it's not the only \"pillar.\" He also listed the outdoors, horses, music, art and food.\n\"In terms of what's going on right now with the bourbon industry, I think it's important for all of us to understand that the good days of bourbon, first they aren't over, and the main thing I want to point out is they weren't a fluke. It's not a fad. The bourbon industry is a signature industry of Kentucky is solid. It's a solid foundation,\" Phillips said.\nFRANKFORT — Sports wagering is a relatively new pastime in Kentucky. The practice joined pari-mutuel wagering as a legal betting activity in the commonwealth in 2023.\nOn Thursday, representatives from the Kentucky Horse Racing and Gaming Corporation told the Interim Joint Committee on Licensing, Occupations and Administrative Regulations that Kentuckians have wagered nearly $5 billion in the last two years.\n\"Of the $5 billion wagered, $4.4 billion was won back by Kentucky players, meaning nearly $9 out of every $10 wagered has returned to a player in the form of winnings,\" Hannah Simms, the corporation's director of sports wagering, said.\nSports wagering revenue supports the state's public pension system and problem gambling assistance account, Simms added.\nIn the last two years, $73 million in sports wagering revenue has gone to the public pension system, and $2 million has been added to the problem gambling assistance account.\nSince 2023, sports wagering has expanded to 13 retail facilities across 11 counties, Simms said. Additionally, 933 occupational licenses have been issued.\n\"These licenses are the individuals and companies who make up the sports wagering workforce in Kentucky and are helping ensure a responsible and accountable industry statewide,\" Simms said.\nMelissa Combs-Wright joined Simms in giving the committee an update on pari-mutuel wagering.\nCombs-Wright, who serves as the director of pari-mutuel wagering for the corporation, said more than $11 billion has been wagered through track betting, simulcasting, advanced deposit wagering and historical horse racing this year.\nTax revenue is then deposited to the general fund, equine development funds or equine industry programs.\n\"Pari-mutuel wagering continues to be a powerful driver of Kentucky's economy and a cornerstone of its equine legacy,\" Combs-Wright said.\nAlthough pari-mutuel and sports wagering revenue is distributed among numerous funds, House Minority Caucus Chair Al Gentry, D-Louisville, said he would like to see local governments benefit more from the practice.\n\"It's the biggest flaw in our gaming model today in Kentucky, and it's something that we have to look at, (but) not from a tax raising standpoint,\" Gentry said. \"There are social costs involved with gaming. I've always been a gaming advocate, but a lot of those costs fall upon the local governments where these things are housed.\"\nIn addition to wagering, the Office of Charitable gaming falls under the Kentucky Horse Racing and Gaming Corporation.\nRep. Tom Smith, R-Corbin, said he's noticing the formation of poker and card clubs. He asked Jamie Eads, who serves as the corporation's president and CEO, if the card clubs are obtaining a charitable gaming license like a bingo license.\n\"I see (a card club) every morning when I pass through my district,\" Smith said. \"They claim since they don't cut the pot, that they take an hourly rent on the seat, that that makes it legal.\"\nEads said she is aware of the card clubs, but charitable gaming has not issued any licenses to poker rooms.\nCommittee co-chair Rep. Matthew Koch, R-Paris, thanked the corporation for their efforts in making the entire horse racing industry successful.\n\"Kentucky has always been the horse racing capital of the world, and now we're absolutely walking the walk,\" Koch said.\nThe next Interim Joint Committee Licensing, Occupations and Administrative Regulations is scheduled to meet at 11 a.m. on Oct. 23.\nFRANKFORT — Legislators on the Kentucky Housing Task Force 2025 on Monday received an update from advocates of modernizing the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.\nRep. Steve Bratcher, R-Elizabethtown, said home ownership is one of the fastest ways to wealth and stability for Kentuckians and Americans. He testified with Adrienne Bush, executive director of the Frankfort-based Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky and Scott McReynolds, executive director of the Hazard-based Housing Development Alliance.\n\"Affordable housing is very challenging in our area as well as statewide. So, we're here today to talk about House Bill 588 – which was filed last session – which helps with the Affordable Housing Trust Fund put some more money in that area so we can allow people to buy homes,\" Bratcher said.\nBush said the fund was established by the General Assembly in 1992. It supports housing for Kentuckians who are living below 60% of the area median income. For one person, that amounts to about $35,000, she said. For a family of four, it's around $50,000.\nBush said the fund is flexible and covers single family home construction, emergency repairs to preserve existing homes and rental development for duplexes and apartments.\nIn 2007, the General Assembly adopted a permanent funding source through real estate transfers. The trust fund receives money through a $6 transaction fee per deed transfer and $6 per mortgage recording fee. Bush said there is no recurring appropriation from the biennial budget, and over the last three years, the fees have only generated $3-4 million annually.\n\"And what we've seen as the housing market inventory has tightened, receipts have steadily declined, from a high of $5.8 million,\" Bush said.\nMcReynolds said the Housing Development Alliance serves residents of Perry, Knott, Leslie and Breathitt counties, and the demand for its services is high.\"The future is even scarier for us. Even if we could wave a magic wand and plug the housing supply gap today, we'd have to continue to build 360 houses a year until 2029 in order to meet the expected supply gap,\" he said.\nMcReynolds said the trust fund has proven to be a critical piece of funding for many reasons. He said the funding is flexible, not burdened by federal regulations and it can provide the local match that's required for federal projects.\n\"The trust fund is a Kentucky program controlled by Kentuckians for Kentucky,\" he said.\nBratcher said everyone agrees there's a housing shortage, and he said the trust fund can play an important role to improve the situation.\n\"This is one option of many that we could use to try to fix this housing shortage and to get people that are hard-working Kentuckians into affordable housing,\" he said.\nRep. Joshua Watkins, D-Louisville, said he's a realtor and has worked in housing development for approximately 15 years. He asked if states where indexing or one-time adjustments have been enacted received complaints from industry stakeholders or others regarding affordability.\nBush said she was not aware of complaints, but said she's not in the other states.\n\"I will say with Ohio, they are both capturing the fees the way we are in Kentucky, but they're also appropriating money through their general fund. It is like a combination of both,\" she said.\nHouse Majority Whip Jason Nemes, R-Middletown, asked about who decides where the funds go. He said Oldham and Shelby counties haven't received any funding.\nBush said there may be some counties where there isn't a Habitat for Humanity or someone with the capacity or interest in developing in that county.\n\"As someone who runs a statewide organization, I want to see these resources deployed statewide as well. I think Kentucky Housing Corp. in receiving these applications has to make tough decisions around how they send a limited pool of money,\" she said.\nNemes said he wants to make sure the money will be distributed to all places.\nSen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, asked about smaller homes.\n\"Do you all see yourself adapting to small homes and stretching those dollars further,\" he asked.\nMcReynolds said his organization is starting a project dubbed, \"the not so tiny home\" that would produce one-bedroom houses that are approximately 600 square feet for people who are flood survivors and have very limited income.\nLawmakers can't act on legislation until the 2026 Regular Session begins in January or if the governor calls a special session.\nThe next task force meeting is scheduled for Oct. 20 at 1 p.m.\nFRANKFORT — A Kentucky lawmaker and other stakeholders are asking the Kentucky General Assembly to consider making a state law that would mirror an existing federal ban on machine gun conversion devices.\nHouse Majority Whip Jason Nemes, R-Middletown, said during the Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary's meeting Thursday that he's planning to file legislation next year. The devices are often known as \"auto sears.\"\n\"It does not make anything unlawful that isn't currently unlawful,\" Nemes said. \"I cannot possess an auto sear today. It violates federal law. That does not change.\"\nMachine gun conversion devices are made of metal or plastic and can easily be attached to the back of a pistol to turn a semiautomatic device into a fully automatic weapon, Louisville Metro Police Department Chief Paul Humphrey said. The devices are easily made by 3D printers.\nHumphrey said LMPD has seen the device used in crime more frequently in the last few years, with 80 seized in Jefferson County last year.\n\"We're not talking about something that helps with accuracy or that helps with self-defense,\" he said. \"We're talking about something that actually makes the weapon far less accurate and far more dangerous to everyone around.\"\nWhile LMPD does report the use of the devices to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives, Humphrey said the agency doesn't have the manpower to prosecute every reported case.\nSince there is no law prohibiting the devices at the state level, Humphrey said local law enforcement and prosecutors cannot fill the gap on their own.\n\"We understand the impact of the violent crimes that are going on on our streets and in our neighborhoods, and this is exacerbated greatly by this problem,\" Humphrey said. \"And what (the legislation would do) is it turns the ability for us – the local police officer, the local prosecutors – to be able to take some kind of action on these that we currently cannot take.\"\nReviewing a draft of the potential legislation, committee co-chair Rep. Daniel Elliott, R-Danville, asked Nemes if the class C felony charge is in-line with federal law as well.\nNemes said he thinks the proposed penalty is the same as the federal law, noting that class C felonies carry a penalty of five to 10 years.\nAfter asking a few questions about the bill's language and the intent, Rep. T.J. Roberts, R-Burlington, said he has constitutional concerns due to pending litigation in federal court.\nNemes said if a federal court order finds the law to be unconstitutional, it would no longer be enforceable.\n\"I think they're lawful,\" Nemes added. \"…. I think the courts will hold that's a constitutional restriction, and I think we should fall in line.\"\nRoberts said he would prefer the legislature focus on expanding the right to self-defense rather than impose more restrictions.\nRep. John Blanton, R-Salyersville, said he is supportive of the Second Amendment and the proposed legislation. He said the conversion devices also pose a risk to law enforcement.\n\"You guys in law enforcement have to have some type of protection there,\" Blanton said. \"These are the types of things that people are using more for an offensive stance than defensive stance.\"\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot act on legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nA draft of Bill Request 8 can be found here.\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary meeting is scheduled to meet at 11 a.m. on Oct. 16.\nFRANKFORT — Lawmakers on the Interim Joint Committee on Health Services received an update Tuesday from the director of the University of Kentucky Cannabis Center.\nIn 2022, House Bill 604 established the cannabis center with a $2 million appropriation for a multitude of projects.\nShanna Babalonis, director of the center in Lexington, testified about some of the projects that staff members have been undertaking. She also offered information about future plans.\nBabalonis said the center is conducting, or hoping to conduct, three projects funded through the National Institutes of Health.\nOne of them – for $2.8 million – determines how cannabis may alter opioid withdrawal, reward and safety.\n\"We enrolled patients into the UK hospital and give them cannabis under controlled conditions and look at how cannabis alters that opioid withdrawal profile,\" she said.\nBabalonis said an important goal of the project is to examine safety to learn if cannabis alters opioid-induced respiratory depression.\nA second $2.87 million NIH grant would look at how cannabis may alter the drive to take opioids in people with opioid use disorder. Babalonis said a decision on this funding is expected soon.\nBabalonis said the center also recruited a new faculty member who brought along a grant with her.\nThe third NIH grant for $720,000 determines how repeated cannabidiol (CBD) doses modify tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) abuse potential and pain relief, she said.\nThe center has two additional grants now under review. One would determine how cannabis with THC and CBD interaction effects change abuse potential and find out if the addition of CBD helps decrease the abuse potential of concentrates or dabs.\nThe second grant would look at the effects of a minor cannabinoid compound – one that does not get people high – on pain outcomes, anti-nausea and abuse potential, Babalonis said.\nBabalonis also discussed a clinical trial on patients with active cancer and several completed projects, which include a trial on the interaction of inhaled cannabis and intranasal opioids, a trial on the impact of cannabis on simulated driving performance, and analytical chemistry projects to test products for cannabinoid content and contamination.\nSen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, asked Babalonis about overdoses in children.\n\"Is there any effort going on nationwide to package this less attractively for children, and is there a way to address that,\" she asked.\nBabalonis indicated that nothing substantial is occurring nationwide.\n\"We're actually putting things out there that look like candy and taste like candy. And for a kid to get their hand in a candy jar. You know, it seems nonsensical to me if we're going to use this as medicinal, to make it look like candy,\" Berg said.\nRep. Rebecca Raymer, R-Morgantown, said there is a difference between natural cannabis and synthetic cannabis. She expressed concern about children who become ill after ingesting substances such as Delta-8.\n\"I don't think everybody understands the difference, and I would be interested in getting some more information on the symptoms they were seeing when these kids came in, if it was just the central nervous system, depression, or if there were other things,\" she said. \"We know there's dangers with the solvents that they're using to extract these higher levels of THC.\"\nSen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville, said those at the center have a tough job.\n\"Your job is to be objective in spite of all the anecdotal beliefs that people have,\" he said.\nRep. Lisa Willner, D-Louisville, asked Babalonis about the study of cannabis and PTSD. Willner said the center's employees have been able to accomplish many things in a short amount of time.\n\"I know that there's not been a lot of study about cannabis and PTSD. But, the National Institutes of Health, the Veterans Administration have both declared it contraindicated for that condition,\" Willner said.\nBabalonis said patients who are \"fragile\" should not be administered high doses of THC, and data collected to date are inconclusive and placebo-like. However, she said staff at the center could examine this issue if the legislature requests it.\nFRANKFORT — Nearly a year ago, a vehicle traveling down I-64 in Bath County struck and killed Troy Caldwell, a tow truck operator from Morehead, while he was working.\nNow, Rep. Richard White, R-Morehead, and Rep. Patrick Flannery, R-Olive Hill, hope Troy's Law – or Bill Request 33 – will prevent the death of more tow truck operators in the state.\nWhite and Flannery presented the proposed bill for the 2026 legislative session during Tuesday's Interim Joint Committee on Transportation meeting.\n\"This legislation will allow wreckers to operate blue lights while stationary and actively removing a vehicle or debris from the highway,\" White said. \"This is a limited, common-sense step that increases visibility and prompts drivers to slow down and move over.\"\nBlue emergency lights are typically reserved for law enforcement vehicles. White said the bill would not create confusion with law enforcement.\n\"It is narrowly written to allow blue lights only when the truck is stopped, not while driving or towing,\" White added.\nBR 33 is similar to House Bill 115, which was filed by White, Flannery and several co-sponsors during this year's legislative session. The bill did not advance past the committee assignment phase of the legislative process.\nIf passed in 2026, Kentucky would not be the first state to allow blue lights on tow trucks, White said. Missouri, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas and others have implemented similar legislation.\n\"Troy's Law is about saving the lives of our brave tow truck operators,\" White said. \"It is about protecting the men and women who come to our rescue when we need them the most and ensuring that they get to go home safely.\"\nFlannery said BR 33 is about worker safety.\n\"People in the towing business have a very important job, but often a very dangerous job,\" Flannery said.\nFlannery's constituent, Bubba Johnson, a tow truck company owner and Caldwell's friend, testified alongside the representatives on Tuesday.\nJohnson told the committee that Kentucky's law requiring motorists to slow down and move over for emergency vehicles is helpful, but not enough.\n\"Adding the blue lights to the rear of these tow trucks would give us one more layer of protection,\" Johnson said.\nRep. Anne Gay Donworth, D-Lexington, asked White and Flannery what the Kentucky State Police's position is on the bill.\nWhite said that KSP was not in favor of the bill during the 2025 legislative session.\n\"I think their thinking is it interferes with their usage of their blue lights,\" he added.\nSen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, asked if the sponsors have considered if other colors of lights, like red, may be used to alert motorists instead of blue to avoid confusion with law enforcement.\nJohnson said tow trucks can currently be equipped with red and yellow lights.\nRep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville, said the committee received a letter of opposition prior to the meeting concerning the proposed bill. She said the letter raised the issue of towing fraud and cited concerns that certain tow truck drivers who listen to police scanners and arrive first on the scene may be incorrectly associated with law enforcement.\n\"Do we know how prevalent that issue is in our state or nationwide?\" Roarx asked.\nFlannery said he did not find the concerns in the letter to be \"persuasive.\"\n\"I'm sure as in any profession there are bad actors and people that do things that they ought not do,\" he added. \"I don't really know how putting a different color of lights on top of a tow truck is going to cause more fraud.\"\nRep. David Hale, R-Wellington, said he was a cosponsor of last year's House Bill 115, and he still supports the legislation. He urged the committee to carefully consider the issue.\n\"I think it is definitely a life-saving piece of legislation that we need to move forward with,\" he said.\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot act on legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nA draft of White and Flannery's proposed bill can be found here.\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on Transportation meeting is scheduled to meet at 1 p.m. on Oct. 14.\nFRANKFORT — The state Medicaid Oversight and Advisory Board heard about a proposal Tuesday that would extend coverage to help Kentucky families offset costs of care at assisted living facilities.\nRep. Deanna Gordon, R-Richmond, said she is working on legislation related to that issue in advance of the next legislative session, which begins in January.\n\"This bill draft would extend Medicaid coverage to assisted living services. For reference, Kentucky is only one of three states that do not offer Medicaid coverage for assisted living services. Right now, Medicaid will only cover the costs of living in a skilled nursing facility,\" she said.\nGordon said unless a patient has the funds to pay for these services out-of-pocket or a loved one can care for them full-time, a nursing home is often the only option. She also pointed to family members who leave their jobs to care for their loved ones full-time.\n\"This legislation seeks to close a huge gap in our state's long-term care system by ensuring Medicaid patients have access to assisted living services,\" she said.\nThis week marks National Assisted Living Week, and Gordon said that with an aging population and increasing economic pressures on families, Kentucky must offer more affordable alternatives to a nursing home placement. Assisted living facilities help residents with daily living tasks, personal care, medication management and many more while preserving the patients' independence.\n\"Assisted living is a cost-effective, long-term care model that provides care for patients who do not require full, medicalized, institutional, structured care such as a nursing home,\" she said.\nCurrently, the average monthly cost of a private room in a skilled nursing facility is between $12,000 and $14,000. By comparison, assisted living services cost an average of around $3,400 per month, Gordon said.\n\"By allowing Medicaid to cover assisted living, Kentucky could provide the appropriate level of long-term care for patients while easing the strain on the state budget and potentially save hundreds of millions of dollars annually in Medicaid spending,\" she said.\nSen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, said the topic of assisted living facilities is interesting and attention on the issue is \"extraordinarily needed.\"\n\"Right now, we don't have any waivers for assisted living, but we are apparently willing as a state to pay family members to be caregivers for people that otherwise really should be in the assisted living facility. Is that correct and would this have any impact on that,\" she asked Gordon.\nGordon said she doesn't know if the state needs to pay family members to be caregivers, but at the same time, it would allow the services to be provided in homes or the most appropriate environment. She said details will continue to be considered before the legislative session begins.\nBerg said it's possible that federal dollars could be used instead. She said she knows of people who would do well in assisted living and are being cared for with state dollars by family members who should otherwise be at work.\nBoard Co-Chair Rep. Ken Fleming, R-Louisville, said a waiver for patient-directed payments exists now.\n\"We do have that in there, and you have to qualify in order to be in a caregiver if you're associated or if you're a relative or family member of that particular person who needs it. There is something like that, but this could be included in that or surround that to a certain degree,\" he said.\nRep. Mary Lou Marzian, D-Louisville, asked about in-home care for those who do not have caregivers.\n\"If someone wanted to stay at their home – a lot of people do – and there are no caregivers, could they just call nursing care to come once a day or a nursing assistant or anything like that,\" she asked. \"Maybe come and maybe make a meal, and they're getting a shower, medications, and that kind of thing.\"\nGordon said there are different levels of waivers, and her legislation is open-ended now.\n\"I think the goal is just to allow patients to age in place and to get the most appropriate care without necessarily having to go into a skilled facility if they're not at that point,\" she said.\nFleming said that Gordon should be mindful of the possible fiscal impact of the legislation, and Gordon said savings aren't always considered.\n\"We are looking at ways to get some of those metrics, because that's the impact that we're wanting to have,\" she said.\nFRANKFORT — The Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary received a presentation from a national policy group Friday about how Kentucky fares on tackling domestic violence and other justice-related issues.\nTwo experts from the Council of State Governments Justice Center, Ellen Whelan-Wuest, deputy division director of state initiatives, and David D'Amora, senior policy adviser, shared findings from a justice reinvestment initiative launched in 2023.\nThrough the initiative, state leaders partnered with the center to study domestic violence and intimate partner violence and recommend data-driven solutions.\nResearchers scoured data from the state Department of Corrections, the Kentucky State Police, the FBI's National Incident-Based Reporting System and Kentucky courts, among others.\nD'Amora said Kentucky faces a high prevalence of domestic violence. He said it's a major driver of violent crime in the commonwealth, contributes to recidivism and consumes significant resources.\nAccording to the presentation, about half of all adults in Kentucky experience sexual violence, physical violence or stalking in their lifetimes – about 48% of women compared to 47% of women nationally. For men in Kentucky, the number was 52% compared to 44% nationally.\nD'Amora said the analysis showed that an average of approximately 22,000 incidents of interpersonal violence occurred from 2018 to 2022, with 60% of it involving an intimate partner. The other 40% involved child or elder abuse or other types of family violence.\n\"There's been an increase in recent years in the case filings and in the temporary protective orders, but the number of granted permanent orders has declined,\" D'Amora said.\nCommittee Co-Chair Sen. Brandon J. Storm, R-London, asked the presenters if they have statistics regarding the prevalence of civil domestic violence petitions or cases and companion criminal cases.\nD'Amora said he wasn't sure if the information was gathered from received data, but said he'd confer with research staff and let Storm know.\nStorm said in 2024, the general assembly passed Senate Bill 319, which is related to crime victims' compensation, and in 2025, legislators green lighted House Bill 38, which made the third offense of domestic violence a class D felony.\nHouse Minority Whip Lindsey Burke, D-Lexington, thanked her colleagues for passing House Bill 38, saying it will help strengthen how re-offenses are handled.\nBurke said service of process is an important issue, and the research will help legislators take a closer look at what they're doing well and where there is room for improvement.\n\"I see that as I work in domestic violence court,\" she said. \"I know that many of the survivors that I represent come back week after week after week to preserve their orders and hope that the offender has been served. And I know that tragically in Fayette County, we just had a mass shooting perpetrated by someone who had an unserved protective order against him.\"\nHouse Majority Whip Jason Nemes, R-Middletown, said the issues discussed during the meeting are timely because two deputy sheriffs were shot while serving a warrant related to family violence. He asked D'Amora to expand on a point from the presentation.\n\"I think you said Kentucky is one of the top three or four states that take domestic violence seriously. I want to ask you to elaborate on that and ask why do you say that,\" Nemes said.\nD'Amora said there are many factors.\n\"The amount of attention that Kentucky has paid, the bills that you have passed, the way that you do take it seriously, the impact that your victims' services folks have had in the last several years in moving this forward, the seriousness with which the certification of VIP (violence intervention program) programing and looking for evidence-based programming that happens, the tracking of it, and the fact that you haven't just said, ‘Oh, well. It's just something that just happens.' That is massively impressive that Kentucky has done that,\" D'Amora said.\nFRANKFORT — Legislators on the Interim Joint Committee on Tourism, Small Business, and Information Technology lauded efforts Thursday to not only share the state's natural beauty, but also boost its economic coffers through adventure tourism.\nThe lawmakers heard testimony from Erik Hubbard, executive director of Backroads of Appalachia; David Cole of King of the Hammers/Ultra4 Racing; and Fred Bramblett of Rides4Fun/Grand National Cross Country.\nThe trio said that motorsports and the related tourism dollars are bolstering Kentucky's economic growth. They presented findings from an economic data report, which showed a $50.5 million impact from motorsports in the commonwealth.\nHubbard said other states such as Colorado and Utah are drawing people through motor tourism, and Kentucky should continue to do likewise.\n\"We have coal mine towns, they have mining towns or mineral towns, but they have converted it into a reason for people to come and spend their hard-earned dollars. That's really our mission now is the switching,\" he said. \"We have a pretty good grasp on the highway presentations with the motorcycle tourism and the car groups and all that and to really focus into what we call adventure tourism.\"\nHubbard said the group works with people in recovery from substance use and exposes young people to motorsports and possible career paths in the industry.\nThe topic of motorsports is not new to many of the legislators, as Senate Bill 63 from the 2025 legislative session became law in March. Sen. Brandon J. Storm, R-London, was the lead sponsor of the legislation.\nHubbard said the bill established protocols around motorsports and created new opportunities for utility terrain vehicles and special purpose vehicles.\n\"To be on a highway they have to have the insurance,\" he said. \"They have to have turn signals, they have to have their seatbelt, they have to either have a windshield or goggles on, and it's a safety protocol.\"\nSen. Scott Madon, R-Pineville, said 300-600 vehicles come through his hometown every weekend to access the trails. \"It's been happening for many years since Erik has taken on this Backroads of Appalachia as a full-time job instead of a part-time job.\"\nMadon said adventure tourism has been popular in Eastern Kentucky, but he expects it will grow in other parts of the state. Last year, a race in Pineville brought in more than 100 cars, representing 32 different states.\nNot long after the Pineville race, Madon said bikers with 300 high-end BMW motorcycles came to the area.\nSenate Minority Whip David Yates, D-Louisville, said as a youth mentor, getting children involved in motorsports could give them a positive outlet. He said it's possible there could be a partnership between schools in Louisville and motorsports advocates.\n\"I think this might be a huge opportunity for partnerships as we move forward, but the economic impact – I think it's got to be promoted. So right now, we're putting a whole lot of money into strategically messaging Kentucky. We're trying to draw people in for their tourism dollars and make sure they're spent here,\" Yates said.\nRep. Mary Lou Marzian, D-Louisville, said she is excited about possibilities involving motorsports.\n\"I just want to congratulate you. This is amazing. I'm from Louisville. This is all new to me, but wow,\" she said.\nRep. Bill Wesley, R-Ravenna, highlighted a Christian men's fellowship event in Eastern Kentucky that includes ATV riding. Wesley said such events can help keep tourism dollars in Kentucky.\n\"What this is doing, this is cutting off that traffic flow, hoping to catch all the Louisville folks from going down to Tennessee and keeping them here in Kentucky. So, we're trying to draw attraction over there. We just appreciate the work you're doing,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — Kentucky lawmakers on Wednesday heard about efforts to research an alternative treatment method that advocates say could help scores of people who suffer from substance use disorder.\nThe Interim Joint Committee on Health Services heard from Sen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville; Dr. Jean Loftus, ambassador for Americans for Ibogaine; and Jessica Blackburn Allen, a volunteer with Americans for Ibogaine who has been administered the compound during drug treatment.\nDouglas said he is working on legislation for the 2026 Regular Session that would create a pathway to study the effectiveness of ibogaine as a treatment option. He described the substance as a naturally occurring compound – found in root bark in central west Africa – that has been used in other parts of the world for a long time.\nHe also noted that Kentucky's 2024 overdose fatality report found that around 1,410 Kentuckians died of drug overdoses that year and that, according to other research, about 85% of individuals who complete a traditional rehabilitation program will relapse within a year.\n\"I'm really here today to introduce a different clinical model. We've been dealing with the same clinical model over and over for decades,\" he said. \"It's not working. We simply have got to stop trading one addictive compound for another addictive compound. We've got to stop it.\"\nLoftus said the human and economic costs of addiction are high, and that ibogaine has the potential to help with co-occurring disorders.\n\"Ibogaine treats treatment-resistant depression, and by that, I mean depression that has failed all medication, all therapy, everything,\" she said. \"These conditions may seem very different, but they overlap in some important ways. Those who suffer from them are often impaired functionally. They have difficulty holding a job. They utilize a staggering amount of social services.\"\nIbogaine is not a cure for addiction, but it interrupts acute withdrawal, post addiction withdrawal syndrome and craving so that the addicted person can then remain abstinent through support, Loftus said.\n\"Looking at costs, and again taking the case of addiction, ibogaine costs about one-eighth that of traditional treatment per person. And these numbers are for treatment attempts per person, not for treatment successes. So just because you spend $700,000 on traditional treatment for someone with addiction does not mean that it worked,\" she said.\nAllen, a licensed social worker from Eastern Kentucky, said her experience with substance use began at the age of 17 and escalated into a daily oxycodone or heroin habit by the age of 19. She said she tried the very best traditional treatments available, making five to six attempts over five years.\nOn Christmas Eve 2008, Allen took her last oxycodone and boarded a plane bound for Mexico, where she underwent treatment with ibogaine. She said she experienced a vision of herself lying in a casket while her mother wept, allowing her to feel the pain her addiction was causing others.\nAllen said she woke up the next morning with no withdrawal symptoms or drug cravings and felt like an enormous burden had been lifted.\n\"My guilt, shame and depression that I came with were completely gone,\" she said. \"I felt overwhelmingly grateful and experienced joy from simply being alive. Within 24 hours, my life was transformed. The benefits from my first ibogaine experience have remained with me to this day.\"\nIbogaine has not received approval from the Food and Drug Administration and remains classified as a Schedule 1 drug on the federal level. Schedule 1 drugs are considered likely addictive with no real medical benefits.\nCommittee Co-Chair Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, noted that ibogaine remains an illegal substance and asked Douglas what the proposed bill would involve.\nDouglas compared the measure to the general assembly's recent work on medical marijuana and said it would clear a pathway to initiate research on ibogaine. He mentioned the possible formation of a legislative consortium to fund ibogaine studies and ultimately seek to reclassify the compound on the federal drug schedule.\nRep. Adrielle Camuel, D-Lexington, asked about current research on ibogaine.\n\"What has been done so far on ibogaine? Because what I was finding is that it's a psychedelic, a psychoactive drug. It may occur naturally, but it seems to cause cardiotoxicity, psychosis, neurotoxicity. So where is the urgency to study this when we do have medications? We do have therapies to help people who are struggling with addiction,\" she said.\nLofus said the current therapies are \"woefully inadequate.\"\n\"They fail people time and time again so we have therapies but they don't work very well. We have excellent evidence that ibogaine works. We have anecdotal reports, person after person saying I tried everything, so we do need ibogaine to address that,\" she said.\nSen. Michael J. Nemes, R-Shepherdsville, expressed gratitude for the legislation that could help people such as Allen, who have been destitute. He said it's a chance that needs to be taken.\nThe next committee meeting is scheduled for Sept. 16 at 3 p.m.\nFRANKFORT — A proposal for a constitutional amendment to restore voting rights to convicted felons in Kentucky may be considered during the 2026 legislative session.\nSen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, and Sen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, presented different ideas about the concept to the Interim Joint Committee on Local Government and discussed why the legislature should take up the issue.\nDuring a committee meeting on Tuesday, Higdon noted that, if not for COVID, he believes the proposal would have already been adopted in 2020.\n\"We passed my bill out of the Senate,\" Higdon said. \"It went to the House; I believe it would have passed, but we cut the session short because of COVID, and it did not pass.\"\nHerron said she worked on restoring voting rights as an advocate and pledged to continue that work as an elected official. She added that, if the proposal wins approval, some felons would still spend a long time without the right to vote.\n\"If somebody is convicted of something like a murder, they do 15 to 20 plus years, they get out and they still have to be on probation. This would say that the person would have to get off probation to be able to vote. So you're still looking at another 5 to 15 years before that person would be able to vote,\" she said.\nCurrently in Kentucky, non-violent felons who have satisfied their term of supervised release and/or sentence of incarceration have the right to vote through an executive order signed in 2019. Herron said the nature of this has the potential to create some complexities going forward.\n\"I do know an individual who at 19 was convicted of a felony,\" she said. \"They did two years and 13 on probation. They finished that 13 years without any other offenses committed, and they were not able to vote until the executive order that the governor did. If it went away, that person would not be able to vote.\"\nRep. Mark Hart, R-Falmouth, had a question regarding the scope of the proposal and what rights it was seeking to restore.\n\"Is your all's constitutional amendment just pertaining to voting rights, or is it pertaining to other rights as well,\" Hart asked.\n\"This constitutional amendment is for restoration of voting rights.\" Higdon answered. \"That is our goal. It does not allow you to run for office.\"\nSen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester, asked Herron whether a constitutional amendment was the best way to restore felons' voting rights.\n\"Could you achieve the same thing through automatic expungement or something of that nature,\" Elkins asked.\n\"That is a great question,\" Herron responded. \"I want to be very clear. Expungement and voting rights are two different things. Voting rights are in the constitution and expungement is not. They are two different processes that do two different things.\"\nRep. George Brown Jr., D-Lexington, said it's only fair that people who have completed their sentence and paid restitution be allowed to vote.\n\"We are one of three states that do not do that, so I think it's time,\" he said. \"It's timely, and it's something that needs to be done of behalf of the citizens of the commonwealth.\"\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot act on legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6. For more information, visit legislature.ky.gov.\nFRANKFORT — The Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and Revenue received some welcome news during its August meeting on Wednesday.\nThe state's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) payment error rate is currently at 3.7% for 2025. The rate will need to remain below 6% for the federal government to continue covering 100% of the SNAP benefits cost going into the 2028 federal fiscal year.\nThe new policy is the result of House Resolution 1 – or the One Big Beautiful Bill Act – which the U.S. Congress passed earlier this summer.\nLesa Dennis, who serves as the commissioner for the Kentucky Department of Community Based Services, said the coverage rate for the 2028 federal fiscal year will be based on the 2025 or 2026 payment error rate.\n\"A payment error occurs when a household receives more or less than the correct benefit amount set at the $58 tolerance level,\" Dennis said.\nSNAP payment errors are identified through a quality control process then the error is analyzed to identify opportunities to prevent the error from being repeated, she added.\nIf the current error rate rises above 6%, Kentucky could be on the hook for up to a maximum of 15% of the benefit costs. Dennis said the cost sharing requirement rates are on a scale.\nAccording to her presentation, if the error rate rises above 6% but stays below 8%, the state's cost sharing requirement would be 5%, or an estimated $62.6 million, for example. An error rate of 10% or more would lead to a 15% cost sharing requirement of an estimated $187.8 million.\nBy 2029, the cost sharing rate will be based on the error rate from three years prior, Dennis said.\nCommittee co-chair Sen. Christian McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, asked Dennis what the department plans to do to keep the payment error rate below 6%.\nDennis said the department was examining its quality control process and other payment data prior to HR 1.\n\"How do we use that data? How do we use that to enhance practice and policy? (We're looking) at our system. Where is our opportunity for some system changes and enhancements?\" Dennis said. \"And also looking at how we can improve practice overall.\"\nThe state's payment error rate has already improved compared to 2023's error rate of 7.2%, Dennis said. The national average at that time was nearly 12%.\nHR 1 is also bringing changes to the Medicaid system. Rep. Ken Fleming, R-Louisville, was curious about the overlap between SNAP recipients and Medicaid recipients.\n\"Are all SNAP recipients, Medicaid recipients? And not all Medicaid recipients are SNAP recipients?\" he asked.\nDennis said not everyone is enrolled in both.\n\"When an individual applies for SNAP, they are asked about Medicaid as well, but not everyone applies for Medicaid. And not everyone who's receiving Medicaid receives SNAP,\" she added.\nRep. Jason Petrie, R-Elkton, who also co-chairs the committee, encouraged Dennis and the cabinet to ask for the legislature's help if needed.\n\"We're all rooting for you to pull that error rate down and keep it down\" Petrie said. \"It looks like it's doing good. When you look at it at the historical, and also from the federal viewpoint, Kentucky is not a bad outlier of a higher error rate, historically. This is something that is within our control to address and keep it below that 6%, which helps everybody.\"\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and Revenue Committee is scheduled for 1 p.m. on Sept. 17.\nFRANKFORT — Lawmakers on the Interim Joint Committee on Education heard from Kentucky's auditor of public accounts Monday about performance data from a recent Kentucky Department of Education review\nThe 556-page report stems from a measure adopted in the 2024 legislative session. It called for a full fiscal controls and operational performance review of the KDE, spanning a four-year period from 2020 through 2024.\nAuditor Allison Ball said the report is a product of \"immense\" work. Investigators looked at department operations, fiscal information, department strategy and partnerships, state board oversight, academic standards and the model curriculum framework, interscholastic athletics, the Kentucky School for the Blind, and preschool, Ball said.\n\"It was very, very broad. It needed to be broad because the KDE is big. It does a lot. It's just very vast, and as far as anyone in the auditor's office can remember, this is the first time a comprehensive audit like this has ever been done on the KDE,\" she said.\nBall said the timing of the examination is good because the KDE is crafting a strategic plan and this will help the department's staff accomplish the planning in an effective way.\nTo complete the examination, Ball's staff conducted interviews, focus groups, surveys, school site visits, and benchmark comparisons against five peer states. Laws and regulations that impact the KDE were reviewed, and KDE leadership staff, superintendents and others offered input, Ball said.\nThrough the review, Ball said staff found the KDE lacks measurable benchmarks.\n\"And this is really, really important if you're going to increase proficiency scores. If you're going to tailor academic assessments for students, you need to have measurables. It's very common to see language like \"improve\" or \"increase.\" And those are great words, but you need to have some measurable benchmarks in order to be able to figure out OK, are you meeting the goals that you need to meet?\" she said.\nBall said the KDE could help improve the lives of students in several areas. Those include improved numeracy, additional school counselors and literacy coaches, enhanced suicide prevention efforts, efforts to ensure preschools are operating at the highest level possible, and efforts to curtail gang violence.\nThe auditor's staff also found that consistent and comprehensive reviews should be completed at school districts. Around 43% of school districts have not had a completed comprehensive on-site monitoring within the last 10 years, according to the presentation.\nCommittee Co-Chair Sen. Stephen West, R-Paris, asked if the audit identified glaring discrepancies in fiscal policy or spending.\nBall said investigators identified some problems with processes, but not in relation to expenditures themselves.\n\"We didn't find glaring problems. There was one area in particular that had to do with grants, that schools had to fill out some paperwork years and years and years ago. It had not been updated for a long period of time,\" she said. \"So, we don't know for certain if they still qualify for those kinds of grants. So, there were some issues like that. We did not find big ticket, glaring problems other than the SEEK funding.\"\nBall said the software used for tracking the budget could be improved.\nRep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville, said she has been working with Rep. Scott Sharp, R-Ashland, and the Engage and Empower Disability Caucus to spur resources for the Individualized Education Program (a collaborative document for special education services).\n\"Thank you for this report. I think it has definitely elevated a lot of really important needs and you've highlighted some of those, from the sexual assault prevention and awareness to our multilingual parents needing access to the special education dispute resolution forms as well as mental health,\" she said.\nRep. Emily Callaway, R-Louisville, said she would like to see much more attention given to career and technical education programs and area technology centers. She said funding is paramount.\n\"I do want to reiterate: I appreciate you drawing attention to CTE and the ATC and the fact that they are not included in the strategic plan. That is really disconcerting to me,\" she said.\nCommittee Co-Chair Rep. Scott Lewis, R-Hartford, thanked staff from the auditor's office for their presentation.\n\"That was a lot to digest, and we probably will have more questions and be in contact with you then,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — Lawmakers on the Interim Joint Committee on Transportation had questions for the Transportation Cabinet following a state road fund update during the committee's Monday meeting.\nShaun McKiernan, the cabinet's executive director of budget and fiscal management, told the committee the state ended the 2024-25 fiscal year with a $61.6 million surplus in the road fund.\nThe motor fuels revenue total was 3.5% below the estimate, but the motor vehicle usage tax revenue performed nearly 11% stronger than predicted, McKiernan said.\n\"The bottom line is the road fund revenue was $38.5 million greater than the enacted estimate,\" McKiernan added.\nA drop in the motor fuels tax rate went into effect at the beginning of 2025, which is the main reason the revenue estimate was lower than predicted, McKiernan said.\nA surprise increase in motor vehicle tax revenue is not the only reason the road fund surplus is higher than estimated.\n\"Net spending coming in below budget added $8.3 million to the surplus,\" McKiernan said. He added that the 2024-26 biennium budget directs any road fund surplus to be allocated to the highway construction program.\nCommittee co-chair Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, said the drop in motor fuels tax revenue will be a \"big hit\" to the funding allocated for city, county and rural secondary roads. Statute currently allocates a portion of motor fuels tax revenue to the Local Assistance Road Program.\n\"I just want to emphasize why we're not blacktopping and repairing all the rural secondary roads that we should,\" Higdon said.\nHigdon also noted the reason motor vehicle usage tax revenue is up is because of inflation.\nRep. Matthew Lehman, D-Newport, asked McKiernan if there are other reasons why motor fuel tax revenues are down.\n\"Is fuel efficiency (and) the rise in electric vehicles … is that also a factor? Or is that a relatively minor factor?\" Lehman asked.\nMcKiernan said drivers using less motor fuel due to more fuel-efficient vehicles is a factor in the drop in revenue.\nIn addition to questions about tax revenue, a few lawmakers wanted to discuss the length of time it takes for road projects to be completed in Kentucky.\nRep. Samara Heavrin, R-Leitchfield, said she's heard complaints about how long it takes for road projects to be completed.\n\"Could you give us any update of why it's taken so long for projects to (be completed), even though the money is there, it's in the transportation plan and has been probably for several cycles?\" she asked.\nMike Hancock, deputy secretary for the Transportation Cabinet, said the cabinet works hard to complete every project.\n\"We have a tremendous load of projects in the highway plan,\" Hancock said. \"We've had conversations about funding and about how much funding there is and how we could stretch those across as many projects as we can.\"\nHancock said a lot goes into executing these projects, such as utility relocation.\n\"There's so much that's going on, and that's not always readily obvious,\" Hancock said. \"It's like the duck paddling on top of the water. You don't always see the feet churning underneath.\"\nSen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville, told the committee that land acquisition delays slow down projects in his district.\n\"Could you give us an idea of sort of what percentage of the slowdown issue that might be, because I know in my district that's a significant issue?\" Douglas asked.\nHancock said right-of-way purchases are often a long, difficult process.\n\"We're anxious to acquire the property to help move the project along, but the person that's being affected has rights as well. And they quite often exercise those,\" Hancock added. \"As we work together to try to resolve those issues, sometimes that just takes longer than we would like. But at the end of the day, we're abiding by all the rules governing right-of-way acquisition.\"\nHancock said when lawmakers do hear about a project moving quickly, it's usually because the right-of-way acquisition process or the utility relocation phase moved quicker than anticipated.\nFRANKFORT — Some Kentucky lawmakers say they have concerns about an upcoming Medicaid waiver program originally intended for youth with severe disabilities.\nCommittee co-chair Sen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, told the Interim Joint Committee on Families and Children on Wednesday that he believes the upcoming waiver program will not be implemented correctly.\n\"Now, there have been a lot of discussions that the waiver that has been formulated and proposed is not what the legislature asked for,\" Carroll said.\nIn the 2024-26 biennial budget, the general assembly appropriated $4.2 million in state funds and $10.5 million in federal funds to develop a new Home and Community Based Services 1915(c) waiver, which is now known as the Community Health for Improved Lives and Development (CHILD) Waiver, Carroll said.\n\"It was meant to serve children who were basically on the Michelle P. Waiver and to move those kids to the CHILD Waiver to free up waiver slots for adults,\" Carroll added.\nCarroll told the committee it's a \"hard conversation to have\" because the alternate program – proposed by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services – will still be serving a population of children in serious need of specialized care.\nDr. Leslie Hoffman, the deputy commissioner for the state Department of Medicaid Services, said the cabinet is asking the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid to approve a plan to use the CHILD Waiver for children ages 0 to 21 with significant behavioral health or developmental needs.\nOfficials are focusing on children and youth with the most complex needs, \"the very acute of very acute children,\" Hoffman said. \"We are focusing on children and youth that are stepping out of acute psychiatric inpatient care such as a PRTF or an at-risk out-of-home placement due to requiring intensive behavioral health and residential supports.\"\nLesa Dennis, the commissioner for the state Department of Community Based Services, said a growing number of children need this type of service.\nIn 2023, there were 60 youth who spent more than 90 consecutive days in inpatient psychiatric care. In 2024, that number rose to 379 youth, Dennis said.\n\"The existing system of care lacks the capacity and range to support children and youth with complex needs, which has resulted in delays in discharge from inpatient psychiatric hospitals…,\" Dennis told the committee.\nDennis said these children are known to have a history of trauma and severe mental health diagnoses such as depression and psychosis. Others have substance abuse disorder. Many of these children are also in-and-out of foster care and the juvenile justice system.\nDr. Katie Marks, the commissioner for the state Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities, told the committee the CHILD Waiver will use a standardized, needs-based assessment to determine eligibility.\nAn individualized service plan and care coordination would be created for those who qualify for the estimated 100 available slots.\nCarroll asked the cabinet how the decision was made for the CHILD Waiver to be used for this population of children.\n\"The language in House Bill 6 was fairly clear,\" Carroll said. \"Again, these are both populations that I and many others advocate for very, very strongly. But it is clear that this waiver was meant to serve a different population.\"\nHoffman told Carroll that the cabinet is seeking to serve a high needs population and is attempting to do that with the funding and parameters provided.\nRep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville, said the proposed waiver is \"undoubtedly\" addressing a need, but she is also concerned the waiver is not being applied correctly.\n\"I share with the chairman that this doesn't really get to the heart of cutting down our waiver waitlist crisis,\" Roarx said. \"We have thousands of folks that are on that waitlist, waiting for services who can't get it, families who can't go to work because they're taking care of loved ones in these situations.\"\nSenate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, asked the cabinet how the general assembly should word future legislation on the issue.\n\"Since we're thinking and heading into another budget cycle, if we were wanting to remove more children from the waiver backlog, what should the wording be in our budget document…?\" Mills said.\nMarks said the cabinet would be happy to co-create something with the legislature on that issue.\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on Families and Children meeting is scheduled for 1 p.m. on Aug. 27.\nFRANKFORT — Allowing residents to keep chickens as pets is becoming an important issue in towns across Kentucky. Rep. Steven Doan, R-Erlanger, told the Interim Joint Committee on Local Government how these \"backyard\" chickens could enhance local communities.\nDuring a committee meeting Tuesday, Doan said legislation on this issue is important because of challenges he is seeing in Northern Kentucky.\n\"There is actually some litigation right now,\" Doan said. \"Some folks had them for a number of years as emotional support chickens, believe it or not. I believe one of the people had autism, and so the city has taken some steps against those folks, and they have filed an ADA lawsuit.\"\nDoan's co-presenter, one of his constituents named Eric Bunzow, testified that having backyard chickens is very relaxing.\n\"I like to go and grab a chicken, and sit it on my lap, and sit in the backyard while the other chickens run around,\" he said.\nBunzow explained that the bill was constructed, \"to give the cities and municipalities control of what people can and can't do with their chickens, other than saying they can't have them.\"\nDoan previously filed this measure, House Bill 806, in the 2025 legislative session. The short, one-page bill defines a backyard chicken as a \"domesticated hen kept on residential property for personal egg production and educational purposes, excluding commercial farming.\"\nSen. Steve Rawlings, R-Burlington, said that, at a city meeting he recently attended, critics of this legislation were almost universally taking about how chickens spread disease.\n\"As I sat there, I thought, ‘people have had chickens from time immemorial,' and I had read articles about what a great fertilizer chicken waste is,\" Rawlings said. He then asked how the advocates would respond to the disease criticism.\n\"If you don't have them, you wouldn't know,\" Bunzow said in response. \"As far as what they bring, it's nice eggs. You know what is coming in and what is coming out.\"\nAnother concern was raised by Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, who wanted to know about how this legislation might impact homeowner's associations and their ability to govern their communities.\n\"Can you speak to how this would affect HOAs' authority to put in regulations in their own communities?\" she asked.\n\"HOAs would still be allowed to ban backyard chickens,\" Doan answered. \"This bill would have no impact on them.\"\nWhile HOAs could still regulate against backyard chickens, the bill would prevent local governments from enforcing any ordinance, zoning regulation, or policy that, \"prohibits a person from keeping six or fewer backyard chickens on any residential property.\"\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot act on legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on Local Government is scheduled for 9 a.m. on Aug. 26.

Last year, the general assembly showed tremendous leadership by launching this housing task force, which brought together voices from every corner of the state, builders, thinkers, city leaders, workforce advocates and more,\" he said.\nHughes pointed to key legislation – House Bill 321, which addresses regulatory barriers to new development, and Senate Bill 25, which deals with zoning, flexibility and innovative financing.\n\"These actions show that this general assembly understands the state and is willing to act,\" he said.\nHughes suggested additional policy solutions to the legislators, such as exploring and encouraging local land-use and zoning reforms, considering how government regulations impact housing, and supporting regional approaches to solving challenges.\nHughes and others who testified spoke about the Indiana Residential Housing Infrastructure Assistance Program, which provides low-interest loans for communities to finance infrastructure projects for residential housing development.\n\"This program approach prioritizes jurisdictions that have taken steps to support housing and reduce regulation. Just last year alone, a $51 million investment supported 2,400 new housing units across Indiana, and the beauty of this fund is the money already being repaid and reused,\" Hughes said.\nSenate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, who is also co-chair of the task force, asked Hughes if he considers the housing issue in Kentucky to be a challenge or a crisis.\n\"I would probably say it's a crisis,\" Hughes said.\nTim Schenk, general counsel of the Kentucky Bankers Association, and John Cooper, governmental affairs consultant for KBA, also offered testimony.\nSchenk said several challenges surround housing in Kentucky, including low-income and workforce housing needs, interest rates, limited federal tax credit availability, proposed elimination of federal funds, and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development cuts. He said inflation has recently eased some of the challenges, however.\n\"Again, banks can address the interest rate challenge. And what we have is a $20 million commitment from banks to go towards a revolving fund, which would essentially address a lot of this housing crisis,\" he said.\nHe said HOPE of the Midwest has administered more than $784 million in tax credit construction at a zero percent default rate. The group, which is a KBA subsidiary, has worked in various types of housing, including historical, manufactured, and new. The new funding could be used where it's needed throughout the state, he said.\nRep. Joshua Watkins, D-Louisville, said when there are partnerships using public-private funds, it's responsible to talk about parameters.\n\"You talked about state average income, but I know state average income and area median income to be vastly different, particularly where state average income can be skewed by a very wealthy person,\" he said. \"I am concerned about eligibility requirements when we're talking about the poorest of the poor Kentuckians.\"\nRep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, said she has concerns that Kentucky lacks enough skilled construction workers to spur development.\nBillie Wade, executive director of HOPE of the Midwest, testified that this is certainly the case.\nRep. Shawn McPherson, R-Scottsville, asked testifier Charles Gardner, research fellow with Mercatus Center at George Mason University, if he has seen interest in auxiliary buildings being placed in large developments with larger, upscale homes and homeowners' associations.\n\"I'll tell you most of these laws that I reference, particularly ones that are enacted, contain explicit carveouts for any sort of private covenant, including HOAs. So it doesn't override the private covenant. I think, politically speaking, that would tend to be a bit more controversial. I'm not saying it couldn't be done,\" he said.\nGardner said another idea that's been broached is putting some type of time limit on HOAs so they must be renewed and won't be perpetual.\nLawmakers can't act on legislation until the general assembly meets in January 2026 or they are called into special session.\nFRANKFORT — Legislators on the Interim Joint Committee on Natural Resources and Energy heard Thursday from two stakeholders involved with a long-time program that helps Kentuckians stay warm in the winter, cool in the summer and manage energy costs year-round.\nShannon Hall, executive adviser for the Kentucky Department for Community Based Services, and Rick Baker, executive director of Community Action Kentucky Inc., testified about the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and a related federal grant.\n\"LIHEAP is 100% federally funded. It's a block grant that comes through the department and then is used as a pass-through to Kentucky Community Action,\" Hall said.\nHall and Baker said LIHEAP was established in 1982 during the Reagan administration, and it helps residents manage high energy costs, reduces service disconnects, reduces the need for assistance through weatherization and promotes responsibility. Payments are made directly to vendors and utility providers.\nBaker said 23 agencies subcontract with Community Action, which has administered the program since the 1980s. The agencies help ensure local interest and coordination of local services, he said.\n\"The largest benefit we have is we have a physical presence. We're the only community-based organization that has a physical presence in all 120 counties of the commonwealth,\" he said.\nCommittee Co-Chair Sen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, said the program has been vital, \"as we continue to mop up the war on coal in our area.\"\n\"These programs have been so critical in saving the few families that we can from literally collapsing,\" he said.\nSmith said LIHEAP has been effective for people who needed kerosene to survive. And as fuel rates have gone up, the program has been a godsend for more and more people.\n\"I can't say that about all the programs, but this has been a remarkable one,\" he said.\nRep. Bobby McCool, R-Van Lear, said he has watched work being done for LIHEAP participants, and weatherization is hard work.\n\"You go on some of these trailers or buildings, and there's no room. And it's rocky. It's muddy. It's all these things. It makes it very difficult,\" he said.\nHe asked how return on investment is being measured.\nBaker said initially there's a model that's used and a machine is set up to measure the air infiltration before work begins on a home.\n\"Every measure that they do, every measure like caulking or insulation, every measure has to show a return on investment greater than what the cost of those materials are. So, you're saving energy costs long-term in those homes,\" he said.\nSen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, asked about a breakdown of renters and homeowners participating in the program. Baker said he didn't have the information with him, but that type of data is tracked and he will obtain it for Herron.\nShe asked about any potential funding cuts and what the legislature should be looking for or considering in the future budget session.\nHall responded that federal legislation, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, did not take any action against LIHEAP, and the next potential hurdle would be the federal appropriations bill expected this fall.\n\"It could be a topic of funding at that point. I think until we get there, we won't know,\" he said.\nCommittee Co-Chair Rep. Jim Gooch Jr., R-Providence, said he has supported the program for years.\n\"I want to echo the comments that Senator Smith made. I've worked many years with your folks, and you do a great job helping a lot of folks who really are in dire need, especially in this program,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — Two Kentucky lawmakers are looking to reform Kentucky's eminent domain law.\nRep. Ryan Bivens, R-Hodgenville, and Rep. T.J. Roberts, R-Burlington, were joined by two constituents to talk about eminent domain law on Thursday during the Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary meeting.\nBivens and Roberts both sponsored eminent domain legislation – House Bill 630 and House Bill 353 – earlier this year. Neither of the bills became law.\nUnder HB 630, Bivens said he sought to better protect land that is subject to an agricultural conservation easement while adding more transparency to the eminent domain process.\n\"We've got to start looking at agriculture, not as an open piece of ground that we can put a black top of concrete over it,\" Bivens said. \"We've got to think about what it does for the economy.\"\nRebecca Steele, a farmer from Bourbon County, said eminent domain has caused her family financial trouble, and even the threat of eminent domain can be costly due to the lack of transparency.\nSteele said her mother invested more than $400,000 in a dam on their property while also planning to use part of their farm as a wedding venue.\n\"When we caught wind of the threat of eminent domain, she completely stopped spending because any improvements (made to the property), we were not going to receive the value of that,\" Steele said. \"… We need more transparency as to what was going on. We needed to know if we were going to be compensated, that it was going to be fair and enough, because you can't just pick up your farm and move.\"\nBivens' bill also proposed changes to the fair market valuation process while additionally seeking to ensure owners of land used for agricultural or conservation purposes receive 125% of the highest appraised value of the property.\nRoberts, who sponsored HB 353, said his ideas for improving the eminent domain process go well with Bivens' proposals.\nRoberts told the committee he believes eminent domain has been \"vastly abused\" throughout the U.S., especially when it comes to the government seizing property for private use instead of public use.\nRoberts said since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of that practice, states, including Kentucky, have made efforts to add protections for property owners.\n\"Here in Kentucky our efforts, unfortunately, did not go far enough,\" Roberts said. \"We still have requirements that allow individuals to have their property taken and be given to other private entities.\"\nRoberts said his legislation would have banned the use of eminent domain for private use. He also proposed property owners be given proper notice and adequate time to fix a blighted property. HB 353 would have also established a public hearing process for eminent domain.\n\"What we have to do is ensure that eminent domain is truly a last resort as is intended under our current statutory scheme,\" Roberts said.\nRep. Nima Kulkarni, D-Louisville, said she agrees with Roberts' ideas \"conceptually,\" but has questions about the details.\n\"Is this a model bill? Is this something that has been implemented in other states?\" Kulkarni asked. \"The reason I asked that is because Kentucky is unique. Is there some way to tailor it more to the needs that we have specifically?\"\nRoberts said his bill was a variation on other legislation from other states.\n\"I did tailor it a little bit,\" he said. \"I'm open to amendments to make sure that it's more of a Kentucky-centric model that adequately protects Kentucky property owners, of course.\"\nRep. Wade Williams, R-Earlington, said he is \"appalled\" the government can take land for economic development. He said, as someone who works in economic development, he approaches property owners and seeks to compensate them appropriately if a deal is made.\nIn relation to seizing property for public use, like utilities, Williams asked how the proposed legislation would impact critical infrastructure needs.\nBivens said better communication is needed to make the eminent domain process less burdensome for property owners while still meeting the needs of their communities. One example he shared is asking a utility company to wait to install powerlines until after the growing season to avoid harming crops.\n\"We don't think about what impacts we leave behind, what those unintended consequences were,\" Bivens said.\nLawmakers cannot take action on legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary meeting is scheduled to meet on Aug. 29 at 11 a.m.\nFRANKFORT — Legislators on the Information Technology Oversight Committee raised questions Wednesday about long-standing problems and financial concerns related to the KentuckyWired project.\nThe KentuckyWired network is a physical system of fiber optic cable that allows broadband internet service to be brought to Kentucky communities. Construction started in 2015, according to the Kentucky Communications Network Authority (KCNA), which has partnered to build and oversee the project.\nCommittee Co-Chair Rep. Matt Lockett, R-Nicholasville, said committee members want to ensure that taxpayers aren't incurring costs over and above what should be paid, and he looks forward to receiving findings from state auditor's office about the project.\n\"I think it is this committee's desire, in terms of this whole day and discussion, that we do get to the bottom of these issues,\" he said. \"The bottom line is we are here as representatives of our districts and people to make sure that we are spending Kentucky's taxpayer dollars wisely, to make sure we protect those dollars, that they are not being wasted.\"\nLorran Hart Ferguson, chief of staff for the Kentucky Auditor of Public Accounts, said Senate Bill 25 from the 2025 legislative session earmarked $1.5 million for her office to audit the project.\nFerguson said Kentuckians deserve answers to two \"big\" questions – why isn't the project complete and what needs to be done to get there. The audit is at its beginning stage, she said.\nCommittee Co-Chair Sen. Gex Williams, R-Verona, said one problem with the project is the government is involved in a \"very dynamic, fast-moving industry.\"\nHe also expressed concerns about procurement codes and if KCNA officials had a say over what happened to a contract with Accelecom, which is registered with the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office as OpenFiber Kentucky Co. LLC.\n\"This has been a big loss for the state, and it's a difference between the way KDE (Kentucky Department of Education) runs things and the way I see some state agencies. KDE, they contract out, they farm things out. They don't try to be the experts in every detail. They contract their email, they contract out their networks,\" he said.\nRepresentatives from KCNA, Accelecom, and the Kentucky Department of Education, also testified during the meeting.\nKevin H. Marino, legal counsel for Accelecom, said Accelecom is willing to renegotiate and mediate with KCNA. Things were going fine until recent leadership changes, he said. \"It's not something just anybody can do.\"\nDoug Hendrix, executive director of the KCNA, spoke about the termination of OpenFiber. In 2017, KCNA entered into a contract with OpenFiber, and its employees were essentially a sales team, he explained.\n\"They were going to go out and market this. And as I said, there was a revenue sharing agreement, but that agreement has terms and conditions like all contracts that they have to comply with. Unfortunately, as you know, since we're here, that contract's just not worked out as intended,\" he said.\nThe authority issued three notices of default to the company, Hendrix said.\n\"They've connected their network without permission. We have a temporary restraining order that the Franklin Circuit Court prohibiting them from connecting to the network without our permission,\" he said.\nRep. Chad Aull, D-Lexington, asked if both political parties were cooperating with requests from the state auditor's office, and Ferguson answered, \"as of now, yes.\"\nThe next meeting of the committee is scheduled for Aug. 13 at 10 a.m. in the Capitol Annex.\nUnless a special session is called by the governor, the general assembly can't act on legislation until the regular session begins in January.\nFRANKFORT — Legislators on the Kentucky Housing Task Force 2025 held their first meeting on Monday, discussing and learning ways to spur housing development opportunities in the commonwealth.\n\"We're hoping this interim to talk about some real-world things we can do in the state of Kentucky, be less ideological and more practical on what we can do,\" said Senate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, who is co-chair of the task force.\nWendy Smith, deputy executive director of housing programs at Kentucky Housing Corp., testified that homeownership can be an extremely challenging goal.\n\"We have folks who could get approved for a loan at… $170,000 to buy a home,\" she said. \"There used to be homes in Kentucky to buy at that amount, and there just aren't now.\"\nLast year, KHC commissioned a county-by-county supply gap analysis, and every county needs more housing, Smith said. It pointed to a gap of 206,000 units for 2024, split nearly equally between a demand for rentals and homes.\n\"For rentals, there is a greater need for our moderate and low-income households to have rental options that are affordable. For homeownership, it is almost evenly spread across all the income bands,\" Smith said.\nSmith said it's most important for the task force to set its sights on flexible resources that \"move the needle\" and accelerate housing production. She highlighted revolving loan funds, economic development tools for housing and employer-assisted housing.\n\"I'm here advocating for the building industry and the building marketplace in Kentucky. Flexible resources can move the market by incentivizing public-private partnerships that accelerate housing production everywhere in the state,\" she said.\nThe flexibility of state-level funds over federal dollars can't be overemphasized, Smith said.\nShe pointed to the Indiana Residential Infrastructure Fund as an ambitious housing goal worthy of replication. The fund provides $75 million for low interest, 20-year loans that support infrastructure projects related to rental or homeownership development. Local governments apply for the funding, which can be used for installation, replacement, upgrades and land purchases.\nSen. Jared Carpenter, R-Berea, said affordable housing is different for every person, and he asks clients what price range they seek when shopping for real estate.\n\"I'm doing a lot right now that are what we call affordable housing. I live in Berea, a really fast-growing community,\" he said.\nWhen Carpenter started building houses in a development in 2019, they were $189,000. However, on Friday, one of the houses sold for $289,000.\nCarpenter said he made the same profit on both houses even though one cost more money. He said the costs of materials to build houses have increased substantially, along with the price of lots and infrastructure such as roads.\nTask Force Co-Chair Rep. Susan Witten, R-Louisville, said there's collective acceptance of the housing challenges, and the problems are not going away.\n\"The good news is that so many of the potential solutions that you all talked about, we've already talked about. These are in motion. We've been looking at other states. Our goal for this task force is to really tee up some of these pieces of legislation, vet them so that when session starts they can go right to committee and we can really get a lot done,\" she said.\nMills and others sponsored legislation last year to address infrastructure costs for developers, but it didn't gain full approval by the end of the 2025 legislative session. \"You'll probably see that coming back around,\" he said.\nM. Nolan Gray, a Bluegrass Institute scholar who testified on behalf of the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy, said he lives in California now and doesn't want to see Kentuckians face a similar housing crisis. He urged the task force to be open to successful initiatives that exist in other states.\n\"I'm coming to you from the future,\" Gray said. \"Decades of strict rules and costly mandates gets you to a place where California is today, where hundreds of thousands of people are leaving the state, where folks who remain have no path to home ownership, they're doubling or tripling up in apartments. Folks are living in tents and cars.\"\nRep. Joshua Watkins, D-Louisville, said he has a local government housing background and he's a real estate agent. He noted that the supply gap isn't just an urban problem; it's widespread across the state.\n\"It's a 120-county wide problem. I think it's the biggest existential threat that the state is facing,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — Kentucky is no stranger to natural disasters. Within in the first six months of 2025, the commonwealth has endured several significant flooding events and deadly tornadoes.\nKentucky lawmakers gathered Friday morning to discuss disaster relief funding needs during the inaugural meeting of the Disaster Prevention and Resiliency Task Force.\nSen. Robin L. Webb, R-Grayson, co-chairs the new task force with Rep. Chris Freeland, R-Benton. Webb said the goal of the task force is to focus on how to recover and mitigate risk, and that will require the Kentucky General Assembly's budgetary support.\n\"We can't prevent (natural disasters), but we can be ready and then mitigate them, and that includes housing, quality of life, infrastructure impacts and rebuilding and prioritization of that and housing,\" Webb said. \"In East Kentucky, West Kentucky we've seen devastation for communities, and people want to live where they live and they should be able to do that.\"\nEric Gibson, the director of Kentucky's Division of Emergency Management, said Kentucky is experiencing disasters of \"increasing frequency and intensity.\"\nIf you compare Kentucky's rate of federally declared natural disasters to Florida in the last 20 years, Kentucky has had 33, which is two more than Florida, Gibson said. The frequency of natural disasters may not be entirely new, but the cost is.\n\"There has been a high level of disasters across the commonwealth for this entire period of time. The intensity of the expense is what's changing,\" Gibson said.\nA major issue facing some communities impacted by the more recent storms is public assistance funding, Gibson added.\n\"I do think that the public assistance being pending is a very important issue to your local officials, as those counties are going to be paying those expenses out of those county dollars without public assistance or state funds or a state disaster relief fund,\" Gibson said.\nReflecting on the last six months, Sen. Scott Madon, R-Pineville, mentioned how the general assembly appropriated funds during the 2025 legislative session for the February storms, but adjourned for the year before the April flooding and May tornado events.\n\"We keep hearing about the having to possibly come back for a special session,\" Madon said. \"Where are we on the money that we allocated? Are we blowing through that pretty quick?\"\nGibson said the funds allocated for the February storms has been used to help those communities. Possible federal public assistance for the more recent flooding and tornados is still pending as the state and Kentucky's congressional delegation works to secure a declaration from the president, he added.\n\"It's hard to come before you and say we need 'x' amount of dollars, because we don't even have all the projects estimated,\" Gibson said. \"But I can tell you that it's hundreds of millions of dollars that is going to be needed in our state to recover across that 83-county area.\"\nFederal funding, if approved, will cover 75% of the cost, Gibson added.\nAnother project the state is working to secure funding for is an update to the state's IFLOWS system, which is a network of water level gauges, Gibson said. The estimated cost to replace the existing 270 monitors across the state is around $1 million.\nWebb said she \"thinks it's important for the committee to note the reliability and accuracy\" of the system. Gibson said IFLOWS is crucial in monitoring rising water levels and alerting officials who then can communicate risk to the public.\nRep. Mark Hart, R-Falmouth, said the IFLOWS system helped his district position local resources in the right places as river levels rose during April's flooding event.\n\"They're so valuable to preparation and pre-planning,\" Hart said. \"I cannot emphasize them enough… Moving forward, we need to make sure these systems are not only maintained but enhanced to where we get more gauges out there.\"\nFRANKFORT — Some legislators want to attract veterans and service members to Kentucky, and members of the Interim Joint Committee on Veterans, Military Affairs and Public Protection learned about legislation Wednesday that could help those groups save money.\nRep. Peyton Griffee, R-Mount Washington, told the committee that he is working on legislation to help draw veterans and service members to the commonwealth by exempting them from the motor vehicle usage tax.\n\"There's a 6% tax on motor vehicle usage, and a lot of folks are paying this when they move from somewhere else into the commonwealth. They're getting hit with this 6% tax,\" he said.\nGriffee said the tax is burdening retirees who want to move back to Kentucky and soldiers who have a permanent change of station to Fort Knox or Fort Campbell. He said he is studying the cost of his proposal but believes it would have low financial impact to the state.\nCommittee Co-Chair Sen. Matthew Deneen, R-Elizabethtown, said the bill isn't new, and he'd like to see it win approval during the 2026 Regular Session, which begins in January.\n\"When I first came to Frankfort, this was one of the bills that I was trying to tackle at the time. Of course, it's dealing with revenue and taxes and all of that. It has to begin in the House,\" he said.\nGriffee, a reservist himself, said some veterans and service members have paid the tax twice – once in their previous state and once again when they come to Kentucky. He said the legislation would produce good outcomes if passed, and he called it another tool to keep people who come here to serve.\n\"These are people that are trained. They are excellent, excellent folks that we want to keep for economic development, add to our workforce,\" he said. \"So, this is an easy recruiting tool for our state.\"\nGriffee also said he would like to extend the tax break for reservists and National Guardsmen in the legislation and plans to work with those groups on the proposal.\nSenate Minority Whip David Yates, D-Louisville, asked if there is a limit on how many vehicles could be affected by the legislation.\n\"If you wind up being kind of a part-time car dealer, where I guess you get six or so many you can run through, then you would avoid that at the clerk's office,\" he asked.\nGriffee said it was a good and fair question.\n\"I think the intent of the bill is for personal use vehicles, and if we need to tweak that language, look at that a little bit, I think that would be something we could definitely look at,\" he said.\nSen. Craig Richardson, R-Hopkinsville, thanked Griffee for the legislation, and said that while it would probably have minimal financial impact, it would send an important message.\n\"It certainly goes a long way in waving the flag; that we're open for business for veterans and active duty here in Kentucky,\" he said.\nSen. Aaron Reed, R-Shelbyville, said he lived in several places – including Alaska, Hawaii and Virginia – when he was a service member. When he moved back to Kentucky with a vehicle he purchased in Alaska, he was concerned about the $1,400 or $1,500 in motor vehicle taxes.\n\"For a new guy coming off of active duty back into the civilian world, that was a kick in the teeth because I had to come up with it or I couldn't drive my truck,\" he said.\nDeneen said there are some compacts between Kentucky and other states regarding waiving the motor vehicle tax. However, one doesn't exist with Georgia.\n\"Regardless of what Georgia does, I want Kentucky to be veteran friendly, active duty friendly. I want them to reside here and retire here, and so I support this, your efforts here, and I hope we can see this move forward in this next session,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — Safer storage methods for firearms and medication and expanded access to child care were some of the proposals that surfaced among lawmakers Wednesday to help prevent child fatalities in Kentucky.\nThe Interim Joint Committee on Families and Children discussed these ideas following a presentation on the 2024 Annual Report from the state's External Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Panel.\nThe panel is comprised of 22 experts who have backgrounds in social work, law, law enforcement, health care, state government, policy and more. Interim committee co-chairs Rep. Samara Heavrin, R-Leitchfield, and Sen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, are members.\nPanel Chairman Benjamin Harrison, who is also the Lewis County Attorney, said the panel is required to meet quarterly, but has been meeting monthly due to the caseload.\nThe 2024 Annual Report includes data from 219 cases, Harrison said, with 70 fatalities and 149 near fatalities.\n\"From our 2024 report, it shows that since 2014, 75% of all cases reviewed by the panel were children aged four years or younger,\" Harrison said. \"The panel has continuously found children in this age group are at a higher risk for a fatal or near fatal event due to maltreatment.\"\nOverdose/ingestion cases are the most common types of cases the panel sees, Harrison added. According to the report, 95% of all overdose/ingestion cases involved environmental neglect, or unsafe access.\nHarrison said firearm incidents involving children in Kentucky have declined post the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, but they're still a cause of concern. The panel has reviewed 79 firearm incidents in the last five years, which is a small subset of the overall pediatric firearm injuries in Kentucky, he said.\n\"In fiscal year '23, the panel reviewed 12 cases involving injuries by firearms. All but one resulted in a death,\" Harrison added. \"58% of all firearm cases involved a handgun. And a handgun, we found, was used in every child suicide case reviewed by the panel, and the panel has identified 75% of these cases were noted to be potentially preventable.\"\nRep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville, said she wanted to know how Kentucky's laws \"stack up\" with parental accountability in child firearm cases.\n\"Do you think that the recommendations around safer storage and locks is kind of where we're headed at this moment in time?\" she asked.\nPanel member Steve Shannon, who is the executive director of the Kentucky Association of Regional Programs, said safe storage is a high priority.\n\"Of my opinion, the adult who has the gun has a cavalier attitude to the gun in the home,\" he said, giving an example of one adult in a case who said they kept their gun stored behind a television.\nAs for parental accountability in relation to overdose/ingestion cases, Carroll said he's found no consistency with how law enforcement investigates these types of cases in Kentucky along with a lack of \"statutory authority.\"\n\"That is on my list for the (2026) session to maybe address that, because these numbers are alarming the way that they're growing, and there does not seem to be any accountability for those who are responsible for those kids in these cases,\" he said. \"And in a lot of cases, there's not being thorough investigations conducted.\"\nPrevention was also discussed by the committee. Sen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, and Heavrin both shared their thoughts on the importance of examining the root cause of the events leading up to the child's death or near death.\n\"To me, it's just very alarming that it's financial issues, then criminal history – which typically if people have financial issues they get into criminal behavior – and then that leads to the mental health, the trauma and then the domestic violence,\" Herron said, adding she hopes every committee in the legislature is examining the root causes of these issues moving forward.\nHeavrin said the panel examines the root causes of each case.\n\"Most of these have prior (Department of Community Based Services) cases and issues that are going on,\" Heavrin said. \"So what can we do for prevention?\"\nHeavrin also mentioned how children under the age of four are more likely victims since they're not in school. Carroll, who works in the child care industry, said fixing Kentucky's child care issues could help.\n\"Last week within our facility, we had three different reports to DCBS,\" he said. \"What are we preventing by reporting those things? What else could we prevent? What else could all the other centers throughout the state prevent if more kids were within their facilities?\"\nLawmakers cannot take action on legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6.\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on Families and Children Committee is scheduled to meet on July 30 at 1 p.m.\nCOVINGTON — Jaimee Kelley Seitz is one of several parents in Kentucky who have lost their children to suicide. She, and other youth suicide prevention advocates, testified Wednesday before the Interim Joint Committee on Health Services.\nThe committee met at The Madison Event Center in Covington as part of a full day of committee hearings in Northern Kentucky.\nSeitz's daughter, Audree Heine, committed suicide when she was 13 years old, and Seitz said her goal moving forward is to raise awareness so no other mother will have to go through the same grief.\n\"Thank you for giving me the opportunity to tell Audree's story because it's important to know that this is not an isolated situation, and it's a situation that needs our attention and a plan and action to protect our children,\" she said.\nSeitz said parents often think they know how their children are feeling and what they are thinking, but she was not aware her daughter suffered from mental illness.\nOthers testified about ongoing efforts to address youth mental health and prevent suicide.\nBeck Whipple, suicide prevention coordinator for the state Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities and a suicide attempt survivor, said his department uses data to drive decisions on prevention, intervention, and postvention strategies.\nWhipple testified that suicide deaths happen more often with males, but young female deaths are on the rise.\n\"As we look these numbers, we must never forget that each of those numbers represent a Kentucky child who is still loved and deeply, deeply missed. As we hold on to those numbers, we hold those families, those communities and their friends as well,\" he said.\nWhipple shared information from Kentucky Vital Statistics' death certification files from 2018-2023.\nIn 2018, 25 children ages 8-17 committed suicide, and the number rose to 30 by 2023.\nWhipple said the usage of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline has been increasing, but some people – especially young people – might not trust 988 for calls, texts and chats due to tracking.\nBut he added that \"those call takers will not ask you identifiable information. They will not ask you your age, your race, your gender. What you share is what they track.\"\nCommittee Co-Chair Rep. Kimberly Poore Moser, R-Taylor Mill, said the topic of youth suicide is difficult to discuss, but it is necessary. She said the goal of the meeting was to focus on hope that community-led suicide prevention works, that recovery is possible and that support is available.\n\"It's necessary to ensure that families with children receive the protection and the resources that they need to keep their kids safe,\" she said.\nSen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, said not talking about suicide has contributed to today's crisis. She said legislators need to see more data about who those who commit suicide are and their modes and methods to better understand the issues. She expressed concern about the role firearms play in some cases.\nSen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, asked what legislators could do to this upcoming session to significantly impact the suicide-by-firearms rate in Kentucky.\nMarcie Timmerman, education and outreach liaison for Mental Health America of Kentucky, testified that she isn't sure there's one law, or that law would always be the way. She said Kentucky ranks 36th in youth mental health as measured by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\n\"So, working on folks to just be able to understand how important that (firearms) storage is, and how important putting time between someone's decision to direct suicide and their access to the most lethal means. That's what CALM (Counseling on Access to Lethal Means) really focuses on,\" she said.\nRep. Ken Fleming, R-Louisville, said he has not seen enough information getting out to students and parents through a cooperative and collaborative approach.\n\"I've been in mental health services for 10 years, and we've been trying to put more information to not only the kids, but also the parents,\" he said.\nHe said he wants to follow up with Jon Akers, executive director of the Kentucky Center for School Safety, about using digital methods and applications to provide students with resources on mental health and suicide prevention.\nFRANKFORT — Kentucky is known for its rich and vital farmland, but members of the Interim Joint Committee on Agriculture heard testimony Thursday about how much is being lost and efforts to prevent the trend.\nEddie Melton, president of Kentucky Farm Bureau, and Aleta Botts, coordinator of the Kentucky Farmland Transition Initiative, testified that many organizations are working to stop farmland loss through the initiative.\nThe KFTI network includes 28 members, connecting attorneys, certified public accountants, estate planners, business advisers and others. Members include businesses, organizations and universities.\n\"In 20 years, we've lost 1.4 million acres of farmland in the Commonwealth of Kentucky,\" Melton said.\nBut what really jumped out to stakeholders was that from 2017 to 2022, more than 500,000 acres of farmland were lost, he said.\n\"We also lost about 6,500 farmers in Kentucky in those five years. And if that continues on with the loss of the farmland and the loss of farmers, in 60 years, we'll lose over half of the farmers that we've got left in the Commonwealth of Kentucky,\" Melton said.\nMelton said updating a tax credit program aimed at farmer retention has been good. He thanked Committee Co-Chair Myron Dossett, R-Pembroke, for introducing the legislation during the 2025 regular session. It was ultimately enacted as part of House Bill 775, he said.\nThe tax credit was increased to $50,000 for land sold to a beginning farmer. Credits can be approved prior to a sale, and all active farmers can benefit from the incentive to keep farmland in production, according to KFB.\nRep. David Hale, R-Wellington, said he's excited about the process and the effort behind the Kentucky Farmland Transition Initiative. He said he hopes it's successful because something needs to be done to retain farmland.\n\"I'm concerned. I'm very concerned as we move forward. Even in my rural district…we are seeing such a loss of farmland right there in the three counties that I represent – Menifee, Bath and Montgomery County,\" he said.\nSen. Robin L. Webb, R-Grayson, said she supports the initiative. She discussed a recent instance in which a family sold a portion of their hayfield for commercial purposes. The tax valuation increased to the point of a commercial site for the remaining land, she said.\n\"I think that's unconscionable. I think we've got to address that because it's going to negate the initiatives that we do, if that's the case,\" Webb said.\nRep. Anne Gay Donworth, D-Lexington, said the information she garnered was great, and asked about the tax credit for new farmers.\n\"It seems like a lot of it is having to do with transitioning from older generations to the next generation. Is there any aspect of it that is helping first-time farm owners, especially when you're talking about only 20% coming in – only 20% making it through the second generation,\" she said. \"How are we supporting people who don't come from farming families but are interested in going into it?\"\nBotts said she thinks they are getting more inquiries from those interested in becoming first-generation farmers. She mentioned it can be a challenging process, but options are possible.\n\"That selling farmer tax credit – a non-generational or a first-generational farmer would be eligible as this purchaser, as the buyer, for that selling farmer,\" she said.\nJessie Hancock, executive director of nonprofit Bluegrass Land Conservancy, and Ashley Greathouse, counsel and director of conservation for BLC, also testified.\n\"I think that it's really heartening to hear this conversation happening on a state level. I think that there's a lot of different angles to the conversation and people are really speaking about this a lot. So, it's wonderful that we've got different organizations that are working on the same effort,\" Hancock said.\n\"We use a tool called conservation easement to do that. We work with working farmers and working land to ensure that that land stays available for farming in the future,\" she said.\nAccording to BLC, Kentucky has lost 17,000 farms during the last 20 years and loses 12 acres per day of forest land.\nDossett thanked Hancock and Greathouse for testifying and said it's tremendously beneficial to pass on important information to his constituents.\nExcept for a special session, the Kentucky General Assembly can't act on legislation until the regular session begins in January 2026. The next IJC on Agriculture meeting is scheduled for July 10 at 9 a.m.\nFRANKFORT — Kentucky's incarcerated youth often need mental health treatment. The Department of Juvenile Justice wants to build a $35 million high acuity mental health facility to care for them.\nCommissioner Randy White told the Budget Review Subcommittee on Justice and Judiciary on Wednesday there is a \"high need\" for this type of facility, which is in the early planning phases.\nIncarcerated children in Kentucky are currently receiving treatment in detention centers, which delays care and is often unsafe for the youth and staff, White said.\nFor an individual with severe needs, the department tries to have them placed into a private mental health facility. White said this means the youth is often sent out of state. He shared a recent example of a child who was placed in a treatment facility in Pennsylvania.\n\"When we require or seek placement for these violent individuals – if we're fortunate enough to obtain a bed and position and treatment for these individuals – we have to send them far away from their support base and far away from their homes,\" White said. \"It could be somewhat traumatic for them to move that distance.\"\nWhite said the incarcerated children who need in-patient, high acuity treatment are often violent, which makes them difficult to place. State law does not require a mental health facility to accept these patients, he said. Sometimes youth sent to other states for treatment are returned due to the safety risk.\nRebecca Norton, who serves as the budget director for the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet, said the $35 million figure is a \"preliminary estimate\" based on a preliminary investigation into the project. The cabinet currently doesn't have the funding to complete the design phase of the project, she said.\n\"The costs listed here are based on discussions that have been had as far as what would be requirements for square footage, and that's based on the number of beds,\" Norton said.\nThe proposed facility would have 24 beds, with 16 beds for clinical patients and eight beds for assessment and stabilization needs. The facility would have to be separated by gender and high- and low-risk offenders, as per statute, Norton told the committee.\nThe estimated annual operating budget for the facility is $12.1 million, she added.\nSubcommittee Co-Chair Stephanie Dietz, R-Edgewood, asked White and Norton if there is a need for that many beds.\n\"Do you believe that we have that many youths that would qualify under the criteria for this type of facility?\" Dietz asked.\nWhite said the need for beds fluctuates.\n\"We see surges. We may go through five or 10 or we may see one or two,\" he said. \"… We have to have flexibility, and it's not going to involve filling 24 or 18 beds consistently. We have to have the degrees of separation operationally to make sure that they're safe. I can get you an exact number, but we do have individuals right now that could be placed in a high acuity facility.\"\nNorton said there is a \"multitude\" of youth within Kentucky's juvenile justice system who have a mental health diagnosis and would benefit from an in-state facility dedicated to incarcerated youth.\nRep. Josh Bray, R-Mount Vernon, said he'd like to know if it is cost-effective to build this type of facility.\n\"I would be curious to see what the contract rate out of state is, because if that can be accommodated some other way, it seems like the numbers are just a little off from where I'm sitting,\" he said, after learning one to five individuals are sent out of state per year due to needing intensive, specialized care.\nDietz asked if renovating some of the current juvenile justice detention centers to accommodate the mental health needs is an option.\nWhite said renovations often cost more than building a new, standalone facility. Norton agreed it is not possible for some of the current facilities to be expanded due to space and financial reasons.\nRep. Daniel Elliott, R-Danville, asked if the department has discussed letting other states send incarcerated youth to Kentucky's facility if the state decides to build one.\nWhite said he isn't aware of any internal discussions, but there are legal and logistical things to consider.\n\"We would just have to see what the bed space looked like and review the legal challenges associated with that,\" White said, adding Kentucky sends youth to private, out-of-state facilities, not publicly-funded facilities.\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot act on legislation until the 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 6. The next Budget Review Subcommittee on Justice and Judiciary meeting is scheduled for July 15 at 9 a.m.\nFor more information, visit legislature.ky.gov.\nFRANKFORT — Legislators on the Interim Joint Committee on Education garnered insight from Kentucky's top education official Tuesday regarding development of the state's new education assessment and accountability model.\nEducation Commissioner Robbie Fletcher presented an overview of the model and said it's based on three priorities – providing vibrant learning experiences for all students, encouraging innovation and creating a \"bold new future\" for the state's schools through collaboration with communities.\nThe effort was spurred by the Kentucky United We Learn Council, led by the Kentucky Department of Education and funded by a grant from the U.S. Department of Education.\n\"You've seen some of this stuff firsthand,\" Fletcher testified. \"You've seen how districts are including students as part of the decision-making in their learning. You've seen districts that test students where they are then also make sure they have a pathway moving forward to meet their needs in reading, mathematics and other areas. But also too, collaboration.\"\nPrototypes for the program were developed last summer, and the goal is to have an approved, reimagined accountability system by the summer of 2026. The KDE, council and stakeholders are in an advocacy phase for the accountability system now, Fletcher said.\nThe proposed system calls for students to demonstrate knowledge and skills in a variety of ways and for state tests that meet student where they are. Additionally, districts would work with communities to design custom accountability systems that reflect local values, and all schools would receive peer and expert external feedback to support improvement.\nRep. Emily Callaway, R-Louisville, said she was grateful for the update, and it's amazing to see morale at an area technology center and witness students' skills and leadership abilities of administrators.\n\"I want to reiterate, while we talk about all this, it is really good to see the implementation and so I'm encouraged by that. I'd like to see it in the other district that I represent,\" she said.\nSen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, said he's concerned about how American students are not keeping up with students from other nations in science. He pointed to rural communities without a hospital, for example, where students could gain valuable work experience.\n\"When you've got limited resources and limited opportunities for collaborative relationships, how do we address that kind of inequity?\"\nFletcher said there are collaborative efforts that are working despite distance between students and worksites.\n\"We're seeing not only districts work with their local community, but they're also collaborating with neighboring districts. I can think of at least two districts that work together…\" he said. \"The students in Menifee County are going to Montgomery County to work there.\"\nRep. Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, said she's a special education teacher who provides accommodations for third, fourth and fifth-graders to take the Kentucky Summative Assessment.\n\"The KSA is not, as it is today, not meaningful, nor useful to educators or students. For example, our fifth graders had 10 hours and 20 minutes of scheduled testing time. In comparison, the Kentucky Bar Exam is 12 hours,\" she said.\nBojanowski asked if Fletcher he could share data about how much of the other scores are explained by math and reading.\nFletcher said districts have collected correlation data to learn how their individual assessments match up. Some districts use STAR Literacy Assessments or MAP Growth Assessments for reading and math to inform the decision-making.\nPoverty is one issue that should be kept at the forefront in student success efforts, said Rep. Sarah Stalker, D-Louisville. She said poverty could be a big barrier to education.\n\"I know it was mentioned earlier about extracurricular activities and the correlation to that…what about housing and food insecurity and transportation,\" she asked.\nJesse Bacon, superintendent of the Bullitt County School District, said more awareness of poverty emerged as the accountability system was being developed.\n\"That will become a part of the expectation conversations that we have. In those pillars is making sure that we are accounting for those things, making sure… students who are struggling with poverty issues have the same opportunities to participate in all of the different activities that are available to any student in our district,\" he said.\nRep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, said she favors the emphasis on skills and testing and the collaborations between students, administrators and businesses.\n\"I appreciated your comment about the fact that sometimes the communities just receive education, but here they have input in it. And thank you for all the work you're doing,\" she told Fletcher.\nFRANKFORT — The first week of committee meetings of the 2025 interim period begin June 3 for Kentucky lawmakers.\nAn interim joint committee is composed of all members of a Senate standing committee and all members of a House standing committee.

However, the building will close this summer for a massive, multi-year restoration project, and lawmakers will convene in a temporary structure on the Capitol campus during the work.\n\"Tomorrow will likely be the last time a majority of us will serve in this role in this building,\" House Majority Floor Leader Steven Rudy, R-Paducah, said during a solemn speech on the House floor Thursday, reminding members to clean out their desks before leaving for the year.\nLike most years, the building has played host to a historic session in 2025, one in which lawmakers passed more than 140 bills and debated hundreds more over the 30-day period.\nA measure on tax reform carried momentum from the start as lawmakers voted to cut Kentucky's income tax rate from 4% to 3.5% beginning next year. Despite some criticism, the legislation won bipartisan support this session, and the governor signed the bill into law in February.\nAs the weeks continued, bills on college diversity programs, workplace safety, transgender-related services, maternal health, Medicaid, and environmental regulations all won final passage following hard-fought debates in committee and on the chamber floors.\nThe governor issued more than two dozen vetoes on those topics and more. But in the end, lawmakers once again demonstrated the independence of the general assembly, overriding virtually all the governor's vetoes during a full day of floor proceedings Thursday.\nOther bills passed with greater consensus, including measures to boost the film industry, combat underage tobacco use, curb cell phones in schools, and fight sexual extortion.\nTeenagers will likely remember 2025 as the year when lawmakers coalesced around a bill to reduce the age for a learner's permit, and college athletes are poised to benefit from updates to Kentucky name, image and likeness law.\nBut the future is still pending for a handful of bills that lawmakers volleyed to the governor's desk before gaveling to a close Friday.\nAmong them is Senate Bill 181, which calls on school districts to implement traceable communication systems for staff and volunteers to use when communicating electronically with students.\nLawmakers also gave final passage to legislation on manufactured housing – House Bill 160. It would prohibit local governments from adopting or enforcing zoning regulations that treat manufactured homes differently from site-built homes in single family residential zones.\nBoth measures are headed to the governor with around two dozen more, and the governor will have 10 days to sign them into law, issue vetoes or allow them to become law without his signature.\nAny bills that become law will only add to the pile of legislative winners this year. From athletics to the Ten Commandments, lawmakers have touched on a long list of issues, and here's a final look as some of the most watched legislation from 2025:\nLawmakers will return to Frankfort in June for the interim period, during which they can hold committee hearings on issues and consider proposals for the 2026 legislative session.\nKentuckians can continue to track the action through the general assembly's webpage, which will provide a weekly calendar of committee meetings during the interim period. Citizens can also share their views on issues with lawmakers by calling the General Assembly's toll-free message line at 1-800-372-7181.\nFRANKFORT — Scores of bills are headed to the governor's desk, including key measures on college diversity, maternal health, and gender identity, after lawmakers made a final, grinding push this week to wrangle votes and hammer out compromises between the House and Senate.\nThe last full week of the 2025 legislative session wrapped up near midnight on Friday, capping off several days of exhaustive floor proceedings in both chambers and marking the start of the veto recess.\nThe governor now has 10 days to sign bills, veto them, or allow them to become law without his signature. Legislators will have an opportunity to override any vetoes when they return for the final two days of the session at the end of this month.\nOne of the most watched bills is House Bill 4, a measure that seeks to end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives – known as DEI – at public postsecondary institutions in Kentucky.\nThe legislation would forbid differential treatment in hiring, admissions, scholarships and other areas based on religion, race, sex, color or national origin. It would also prevent campuses from requiring or incentivizing students to in participate in DEI training, and it would prohibit public institutions from using resources on DEI training, offices and initiatives.\nThe issue has loomed large over the session: Lawmakers held multiple committee hearings on DEI during the 2024 interim period and signaled early on that a major bill was likely to win support this year.\nThe proposal ignited a final round of tense debate Thursday as lawmakers sparred over the racial disparities and the legacy of slavery before voting 32-6 to advance HB 4 off the Senate floor. The bill has been delivered to the governor.\nAbortion also surfaced as major issue in the past week after lawmakers expanded a measure on freestanding birthing centers into a broader maternal health bill that seeks to clarify some uncertainties over Kentucky's abortion law.\nThe final version of House Bill 90 includes provisions to ensure that women experiencing a miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, or other life-threatening complications can receive care. It calls for hospitals, birthing centers and other obstetric care centers to offer perinatal palliative care to women if their baby is at risk of death or severe abnormalities.\nProponents say the legislation will help alleviate confusion for doctors when a pregnancy is jeopardizing a woman's life. However, some lawmakers criticized the sponsors for not gathering more input from health care providers or doing more to address concerns with Kentucky's abortion law.\nMeanwhile, the bill's provisions on freestanding birthing centers have marked a significant breakthrough for supporters, who have labored for years to rally a coalition around the concept. That portion of HB 90 would create a regulatory framework for the centers to operate in Kentucky and eliminate the certificate of need requirement for small centers.\nHB 90 cleared a divided final vote in both chambers Thursday and was delivered to the governor.\nMuch of the 2025 has focused on high-profile social issues, and few have garnered more attention or debate than publicly-funded services for transgender Kentuckians.\nSenate Bill 2 moved out of the gate early this year, seeking to prohibit public funds from being spent on certain procedures, treatments and surgeries related to gender transition in Kentucky prisons. The bill won final approval in the House late Friday 73-12.\nAnother measure – House Bill 495 – would nullify an executive order that the governor issued in September banning the use of state funds on conversion therapy for minors. The bill was expanded this week to prohibit the use of Medicaid funds on hormone treatments or surgeries related to transgender care.\nIt also won final passage in the House on Friday 70-18.\nMany other measures have secured broad, bipartisan support this year, and among those, Senate Bill 3 proved once again that sports are the great uniter in the commonwealth.\nThe legislation would update Kentucky's name, image and likeness law for college athletes, aligning it with national standards in the aftermath of the House v. NCAA court case. The case could open the door to universities directly compensating student athletes.\nSB 3 sailed off the House floor on Tuesday with unanimous support, and the governor signed it into law Thursday.\nBut of all the stakeholders celebrating legislative victories this year, teenagers may be celebrating the most.\nThat's thanks to House Bill 15, which would reduce the minimum age for getting a learner's permit in Kentucky from 16 to 15 years old. The legislation breezed through final votes in both chambers this week and has been sent to the governor.\nOther measures on artificial intelligence, fraud, workplace safety, state regulations, and education have all received a final tap of the gavel. Here's a look at some of the bills that won final passage this week.\nLawmakers are scheduled to reconvene on March 27 and 28 for the final two days of this year's 30-day session.\nKentuckians can track the action this year through Legislative Record webpage, which allows users to read bills and follow their progression through the chambers.\nCitizens can also share their views on issues with lawmakers by calling the General Assembly's toll-free message line at 1-800-372-7181.\nFRANKFORT — House Bill 90 has undergone a metamorphosis throughout the legislative process, but the lawmakers behind the legislation hope it will provide better maternal health outcomes across Kentucky.\nHB 90 began as only a bill to establish a regulatory framework for freestanding birthing centers and remove the certificate of need requirement for centers with no more than four beds, House Majority Whip Jason Nemes, R-Middletown, said.\nThose provisions remain, but as the bill advanced off the House floor on Thursday, lawmakers also voted to provide clarifying language to Kentucky's abortion law and make perinatal palliative care available in Kentucky hospitals.\nDoctors have communicated to the legislature that the current abortion ban law is confusing, which is putting pregnant women in potentially deadly situations, Nemes, who is the primary sponsor of HB 90, said.\n\"This is a problem that is real and present, and we need to solve it,\" he said.\nThe clarifications to Kentucky's abortion law in HB 90 will ensure pregnant women experiencing a miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy or other life-threatening complications can receive care, Nemes added.\nRep. Nancy Tate, R-Brandenburg, Rep. Kimberly Poore Moser, R-Taylor Mill, Dr. Jeffery Goldberg with the Kentucky Chapter of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and pro-life advocates worked with Nemes on the legislation, he said.\nNemes said the bill is not an exception to the abortion law, but a clarification.\n\"There are no additional abortion exceptions or exceptions to abortions in this bill,\" he said. \"It's a clarification of what it means when a pregnant woman is presenting and her life is in jeopardy.\"\nHB 90 also includes language from House Bill 414 on perinatal palliative care, Nemes said. Tate has filed perinatal palliative care legislation in the past and is the primary sponsor of this year's HB 414.\nThe bill would require hospitals, birthing centers and other obstetric care centers to offer perinatal palliative care to women who receive a prenatal diagnosis that their baby may die before or after birth or at the diagnosis of a potentially deadly or life-altering fetal abnormality.\nTate said the care would be optional and would serve as a source of support for a mother and a family going through a difficult time.\n\"Perinatal palliative care is to ensure when a woman has a less than perfect pregnancy … that the woman and her family will have the spiritual, emotional, financial and medical attention they need,\" Tate said.\nSeveral lawmakers raised concerns about the clarifying language on abortions during a nearly hour-long debate on HB 90 on the House floor. Several members said the language is confusing, lacks proper medical terminology and doesn't go far enough to ensure care and protect physicians from criminal liability.\nRep. Lisa Willner, D-Louisville, said she appreciates the intent of the language and the collaboration behind the bill, but finds the language concerning. She asked Nemes if he intends to keep working on the issue.\n\"Dr. Goldberg … was one of maybe the most ambiguous testifiers I've ever heard in committee. He said multiple times, 'This is very imperfect. This needs lots of work,'\" Willner said. \"… Do you agree this is going to be an ongoing conversation, and we may be able to get to a safer, from my perspective, place, or is this the end of the conversation?\"\nNemes said while he believes Goldberg's testimony was clear, he agrees the legislation is not perfect.\n\"We are committed to having those continued conversations,\" Nemes said.\nRep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville, said she was proud to vote for the freestanding birthing center bill when it came to the House floor for a vote the first time. She said while the language in the new HB 90 \"is not medically accurate,\" she would vote \"yes\" on the legislation.\n\"I do intend to vote yes today because if it does grant a pregnant individual the opportunity to have life-saving care, then we need to do that,\" Roarx said.\nHB 90 advanced off the House floor by a 74-17 vote, and the Senate voted 29-0 with five pass votes on the legislation earlier Thursday.\n\"I don't want to mislead anybody. Kentucky is a pro-life state, and it will stay as such,\" Nemes said. \"But if we have to do things to continue to improve the lives of pregnant women in danger and to help doctors, we are committed to doing that.\"\nHB 90 is now headed to the governor's desk for his signature or veto. He can also allow the bill to become law without his signature.\nFRANKFORT — After impassioned debate Wednesday afternoon, the Kentucky Senate adopted a bill that seeks to ban diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at public postsecondary intuitions in Kentucky.\nHouse Bill 4, sponsored by Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, advanced off the Senate floor with a 36-6 vote. It was presented on the chamber floor by Sen. Stephen West, R-Paris.\nWest said the legislation seeks to ensure that Kentucky's public universities are focused on providing opportunity for everyone – not advancing policies that divide students into competing groups. The legislation would remove mandates that focus on identity politics rather than meri-based academic success, he said.\n\"Every student regardless of background deserves a fair shot, and that's what this body should be committed to. There's a strong legal precedent in the constitution and in recent court cases for the passage and implementation of House Bill 4,\" he said.\nThe measure would prohibit differential treatment at public colleges and universities based on religion, race, sex, color or national origin in hiring, admissions, scholarships and contracts. It would also halt the use of institutional resources to create or maintain a DEI office, training or initiative.\nAmong other provisions, HB 4 would prevent institutions from requiring students to complete courses that indoctrinate participants in discriminatory concepts. Campuses could not require or incentivize students, faculty or staff to attend a DEI training, and any investigations of a bias incident would require authorization by the general counsel and meet certain criteria.\nWest said the DEI prohibitions do not include the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, sex-based dormitory restrictions and athletic eligibility, accommodations for religion, the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX and others.\nLawmakers debated the bill for nearly two hours, recounting personal stories and, at times, discussing the history of race and slavery in America.\nSenate Democratic Floor Leader Gerald A. Neal, D-Louisville, was among several who spoke in opposition to the bill, and recalled how he marched with civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. He said he wanted to put the past and present in context.\n\"What I'm saying is, even today you hear the language, there's nothing systemic. There's nothing structural. Everything we do is systemic. Every time we do a policy we're setting up some type of system, a framework, guidelines, context,\" he said. \"And we enforce it. And guess what, what we don't do, enhances or allows for those unofficial behaviors to take shape, which are manifest today. We all know it. Racism is wide and deep.\"\nSenate Minority Whip David Yates, D-Louisville, also spoke against the measure. He read from an e-mailed letter from four Roman Catholic bishops of Kentucky. It stated that \"those who are in positions of power or who have benefitted from a system of inequalities have a moral responsibility to address injustice.\"\nSpeaking in favor of the measure was Sen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville, who argued that the legislation is about establishing \"a fair playing field for all.\" He said the goals of DEI begin in the home with parental support.\n\"Let us consider strengthening our homes first. Let us consider teaching our children the self-respect, the self-motivation and the self-accomplishment and monitoring their independent thought, their personal responsibility and their accountability for their own personal decisions,\" he said.\nThe bill now heads back to the House. If lawmakers concur with the final version of the bill, it will next head to the governor's desk.\nFRANKFORT — A bill that would change how the state regulates water pollution advanced off the House floor on Wednesday.\nRep. Jim Gooch Jr., R-Providence, presented Senate Bill 89 on the House floor on behalf of the bill's primary sponsor, Sen. Scott Madon, R-Pineville. Gooch said the legislation would protect the coal industry from restrictive regulations.\n\"We are now seeing unwanted government overreach from our very own Energy an Environment Cabinet,\" Gooch said. \"Permitting delays have happened that cause unnecessary red tape.\"\nGooch said the \"out of control\" regulatory process could impose $100 million in additional costs for the coal industry. The legislation is a response to a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the federal government's ability to regulate water pollution for certain bodies of water, he added.\nA major provision of SB 89 would change the definition of \"waters of the commonwealth,\" Gooch said.\nAn amendment made to the bill during the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee meeting earlier Wednesday morning would include navigable waters, sinkholes with open drains, naturally occurring springs and wellhead protection areas in the definition.\nAll rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, ponds, impounding reservoirs, springs, wells, marshes, and all other bodies of surface or underground water, natural or artificial would be removed from the definition under this bill.\nAdditionally, SB 89 would change the bond protocol regarding long-term water treatment permits for coal companies.\nRep. Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, asked Gooch if the legislation would impact a creek near her home.\nGooch said he believes the cabinet could still regulate other types of water not specifically mentioned in the bill.\nIn a floor speech, Rep. Chad Aull, D-Lexington, urged everyone to vote \"no\" on SB 89. He said he believes the bill threatens Kentucky's drinking water supply and the environment.\n\"This is not just an environmental issue, my friends,\" Aull said. \"This bill will also affect our economy and our people's health. This bill would require additional treatment for drinking and wastewater because fewer water sources would be protected upstream.\n\"The increased cost of additional testing would be passed down to Kentuckians through rate increases in our water bills.\"\nIn response, Gooch said one of the biggest sources of groundwater issues is sedimentation caused by changes in water levels and another is highway and parking lot runoff.\nHazardous substance dumping would still be illegal if SB 89 becomes law, Gooch added.\nSeveral lawmakers shared concerns on the House floor about the potential for the legislation to cause carcinogens and other harmful materials to contaminate the water. Rep. Sarah Stalker, D-Louisville, asked Gooch if he would be willing to fix any unforeseen consequence caused by the legislation.\nGooch said he would.\n\"With proper knowledge and facts showing that there were detrimental impacts because of this, yes ma'am, you have my word,\" he said.\nRep. Ryan Bivens, R-Hodgenville, spoke in favor of SB 89. He said as a farmer, his biggest concern is government overreach. He also doesn't believe SB 89 would threaten Kentucky's drinking water.\n\"Folks, we're not going backwards on this,\" Bivens said. \"We still have regulation in place that we're going to follow ... Our water is much cleaner today than it's ever been.\"\nSB 89 advanced off the House floor by a 69-26 vote.\nRep. Vanessa Grossl, R-Georgetown, said she proudly voted \"yes\" on the bill because it addresses regulatory uncertainty that is having a negative impact on construction and infrastructure improvements.\n\"This bill safeguards our natural resources while promoting responsible growth,\" Grossl said. \"This framework provides predictability for developers who are building affordable housing in central Kentucky and ensuring that those essential environmental protections remain in place.\"\nSB 89 will need to return to the Senate for concurrence on changes made to the legislation before it can go to the governor's desk for his signature or veto.\nFRANKFORT — A Senate bill that would impose new regulations on cannabis-infused beverages in Kentucky took another step toward final passage on Wednesday.\nSen. Julie Raque Adams, R-Louisville, told the House Licensing, Occupations and Administrative Regulations Committee that Senate Bill 202 would put reasonable, common sense public health guardrails in place for cannabis-infused beverages.\nAdams said she began working on the bill after hearing about the beverages and their potency during an interim meeting in September.\n\"This is some really serious stuff that's out there,\" Adams said. \"Everybody from that September meeting started coming to the table and talking about how we can put some controls on this to protect kids from getting their hands on it.\"\nIndividuals under the age of 21 would be prohibited from purchasing a cannabis-infused beverage under SB 202.\nAdams said the recently updated version of SB 202 would define a cannabis-infused beverage as a cannabinoid-liquid, intoxicating product that does not contain more than 5 milligrams per a 12-ounce serving.\nThe drinks would fall under the purview of the Division of Distilled Spirits and retail regulations enforcement would be handled by the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC), Adams said. The state Cabinet for Health and Family Services would continue to regulate the manufacturing and testing of the products, she added.\nFor retailers that currently have products on the shelves at more than 5 milligrams, Adams said they would have until June 1 to remove those products from their stores.\nFestivals and fairs would have until Jan. 1, 2026, Adams added.\nSB 202 would also require businesses who want to sell cannabis-infused beverages to hold a license.\nSeveral consumers and representatives from the hemp industry testified against SB 202 in committee on Wednesday. They believe the bill would harm the hemp industry, Kentucky businesses and recovering alcoholics who use the products to stay sober and prevent withdrawal symptoms.\nJim Higdon, co-founder of Cornbread Hemp, asked the committee to consider changing the milligram cap from 5 to 25, which other states, like Tennessee, have done.\nRep. Anne Gay Donworth, D-Lexington, asked the group about hemp's economic impact on Kentucky since hemp was legalized around a decade ago.\n\"It's a $330 million economy that employs 3,000 people,\" Annie Rouse, a licensed hemp manufacturer, distributor and retailer, said.\nHouse Minority Caucus Chair Al Gentry, D-Louisville, asked Adams how she determined the limit should be 5 milligrams in the legislation.\nAdams said several things influenced that decision, including a study from Johns Hopkins University.\n\"The Johns Hopkins study put 3.75 is when (the beverages) begin the intoxicating effects, so we thought 5 milligrams was above that study,\" she said. \"We thought that was a good place to start.\"\nOn treating cannabis-infused beverages similarly to alcoholic beverages, Gentry said he agrees there should be parity, but he doesn't think SB 202 hits that mark.\n\"I don't believe the bill as it is written today does that because it bans all the products above 5 milligrams,\" he said. \"I think we should be more focused on putting guardrails about that, warning what the products are.\"\nThe committee voted 16-2 with two pass votes to advance SB 202 to the House floor.\nRep. Michael Meredith, R-Oakland, who voted \"yes\" on the legislation, said he remembers when the general assembly passed the hemp bill.\n\"I really don't think when that was contemplated back in 2011 or 2012 that we contemplated anything like this proliferation in this space,\" he said, adding he doesn't think the bill is perfect right now, but he's seen it improve as it's made its way through the legislative process.\nAdams said SB 202 is just a starting point.\n\"We revisit bills all the time, and will we revisit this? 100%,\" she said. \"Should we talk about it in the interim? 100% Will we get to an even better place? 100%. But we have got to stop this proliferation. We have to stop the ability of these products getting into the hands of our kids.\"\nFRANKFORT — Studies show cell phones are a major distraction for primary and secondary education students. House Bill 208 seeks to resolve the issue in public schools across Kentucky.\nRep. Josh Bray, R-Mount Vernon, is the primary sponsor of the legislation. He said on the House floor on Tuesday that the legislation would require the board of education for each public school district to adopt a policy on the possession and use of personal telecommunication devices by students during the school day.\nBray said studies show limiting student cell phone use at school improves mental health and test scores.\n\"There's been a lot of research done on cell phones with kids and the damages it causes to their mental health and to their ability to learn when they're near,\" Bray said. \"There have been studies done that show in school districts that have implemented policies to prohibit their usage during instructional time, test scores have jumped up by 6% pretty immediately.\"\nThe House adopted a floor amendment to HB 208 on Tuesday that added some clarifying language and stipulated that the prohibition is for instructional time, with a few exceptions, Bray said.\nTeachers would be allowed to authorize cell phone use for an instructional purpose, and students would be allowed to use their phones during an emergency, he added.\nThe legislation would also direct the school districts to block access to social media websites on school computers and school internet networks.\nRep. Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, said cell phone usage is not a major issue at the elementary school where she works, but she knows HB 208 would help middle and high schools greatly.\nShe said she knows of a school in Louisville where a prohibition policy was recently implemented successfully.\n\"In the first two weeks of school, more books were checked out in the library than in the entire previous year,\" Bojanowski said. \"… I appreciate this legislation, and I strongly support it.\"\nRep. Chad Aull, D-Lexington, said one of his children is a \"pretty strong advocate\" against HB 208. He said his child worries how the bill might impact her ability to contact her parents during an emergency.\nBray said there is \"a clear exception\" for emergencies within the bill.\nAull said he would vote in-favor of the legislation, despite his daughter's opposition, since the bill would allow a student to use a cell phone during an emergency.\nRep. Anne Gay Donworth, D-Lexington, said she is also not going to be \"very popular\" with her children by voting in favor of HB 208, but she believes it is the right thing to do.\n\"I want them focused on learning while they are there,\" she said, adding she believes the legislation will improve behavioral issues at schools as well.\nThe Kentucky House of Representatives unanimously approved HB 208 on Tuesday by a 98-0 vote. It will now go before the Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — Horse racing, bourbon and film? With Senate Bill 1, filmmaking could become another one of Kentucky's signature industries.\nThe House Economic Development and Workforce Investment Committee advanced the legislation on Tuesday. SB 1 is sponsored by Sen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, and Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester.\nWheeler said Kentucky has had some of the most generous tax credits on the books for television and filmmakers for years, but they're being underutilized.\n\"Here in Kentucky, with our natural landscape, our friendly people and endless potential, I think that we can take Kentucky film production to the next level,\" Wheeler said.\nSB 1 would create the Kentucky Film Office within the state Cabinet for Economic Development. Wheeler said Kentucky has the potential to produce a blockbuster hit, and the office would set up the proper infrastructure to support that type of filmmaking.\n\"The film office will have certain duties. Most importantly, it will basically create a website and the infrastructure necessary to attract these types of feature films to the Commonwealth of Kentucky,\" Wheeler said. \"In addition, there will be a Kentucky Film Leadership Council made up of people in the industry, folks from the economic development cabinet, people that know how to bring the film industry and make it successful in this commonwealth.\"\nIn Georgia, filmmakers have access to a state-ran website where they can look at all the potential filming locations and access information on permitting, among other things. Wheeler said Kentucky is currently missing that key component, but SB 1 would fix that.\nThere are some critics who feel SB 1 would only help bigger Kentucky cities like Lexington and Louisville. Wheeler said he disagrees, using an upcoming Netflix film that was produced in Louisa as an example.\n\"There are places that this bill will have an application way beyond Louisville and Lexington, but if it helps Louisville and Lexington, great,\" Wheeler said. \"If one area of the commonwealth succeeds, we all succeed.\"\nRep. Matt Lockett, R-Nicholasville, asked why there is a need for a separate board to get this initiative running.\nStivers said he's worked on SB 1 for a few years, and through his research and conversations with the cabinet, he's learned filmmaking is an industry where networking and having certain connections are valuable.\n\"Secretary (Jeff) Noel said we really don't have that type of mindset and network within our cabinet, but give us a tool, then we will be able to go to a different level, as Sen. Wheeler said,\" Stivers said. \"Working with the cabinet – and they did have input on this – this is the product we get.\"\nStivers and Wheeler said SB 1 has the potential to boost Kentucky's economy. Rep. Nima Kulkarni, D-Louisville, asked how the tax incentives may impact local economies.\n\"What is the local impact in terms of growing workforce, growing small businesses or ancillary benefits like that\" she asked.\nCiting a 2022 University of Louisville study, Wheeler said the Kentucky film, motion picture and recording industry generated about $200 million in revenue.\n\"Which they estimated helped other businesses earn approximately $128 million as a result of that, and approximately $27 million was paid in federal, state and local taxes,\" he said.\nStivers said the transient room tax will help fund the office.\n\"The way this is funded is taking up to $500,000 from the transient room tax. They generate $2.5 million a year,\" he said.\nAndrew McNeil with the Kentucky Forum for Rights, Economics and Education, asked the committee to vote against SB 1 due to the tax incentive provisions in the legislation.\n\"These are handouts,\" he said, adding he doesn't believe the bill will boost Kentucky's economy, but will instead use taxpayer money to subsidize the film industry.\nStivers said the system is set up to monitor and ensure the filmmaking industry will make a true investment in Kentucky's economy.\n\"If the people come in from out of state and they pay a wage here, they have to pay income tax here,\" Stivers said. \"That's how you generate that type of return and payment back.\"\nThe House Economic Development and Workforce Investment Committee approved SB 1 by a 17-0 vote with one pass vote.\nThe bill will now go before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A granite monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments would find its way back to the Kentucky State Capitol grounds if House Joint Resolution 15 is adopted.\nOn Monday, lawmakers on the Senate State and Local Government Committee advanced HJR 15 with an 8-1-1 vote. Rep. Shane Baker, R-Somerset, and Rep. Jason Petrie, R-Elkton, testified in favor of the measure.\n\"This resolution basically does three things: It directs the Historic Properties Advisory Commission to retrieve the monument. It directs them to return that monument to the State Capitol grounds and place it in monument park, then to simply maintain the display,\" Baker, primary sponsor of the resolution, testified.\nThe State Capitol Monument Park includes the Kentucky Organ Donor Monument and the Kentucky COVID Memorial, among others.\nBaker said there's a long history and tradition of public monuments and displays that acknowledge the role and significance of the Ten Commandments and the role they've played in the history of the United States.\nThe Kentucky State Aerie of the Fraternal Order of Eagles donated the moment to Kentucky in 1971. It remained on permanent display until the 1980s, when it was moved to storage amid a construction project.\nLawmakers passed a resolution to return the display in 2000. However, a court prohibited the enforcement of the resolution, and the monument was returned it to the Fraternal Order of Eagles in Hopkinsville.\nIn 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the exhibition of an essentially identical monument at the Texas State Capitol, Baker said, arguing that the court has resolved legal issues around such displays.\nSen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, said she's a Christian who grew up in the African Methodist Episcopal Church and still attends church on a regular basis. But she cast a pass vote and said she had concerns about making sure other beliefs are represented at the Capitol.\n\"I'm just curious as to why specifically the Ten Commandments, and if we were to do something like that, what are we going to do to ensure other religions like Buddhism, Muslims, other faiths have a presence here at our Capitol,\" she asked.\nBaker said the resolution isn't about religious displays; it's about returning a historic monument to the Capitol grounds.\n\"Anyone's welcome to, if they so desire, to go in the future and file bills or resolutions in that vein to do exactly what you're talking about, but that's not what we're trying to do today,\" he said.\nPetrie said there have been similar questions posed by House members during this legislative session.\n\"This deals with a particular historical event, and also a particular monument with particular reasons that endured or suffered through a particular set of Supreme Court cases and tests that, over decades, became obsolete,\" he said.\nSen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville, said she's a person of faith, and she appreciates the helpful information included in the resolution. However, she voted against the measure, saying that, after reading the key legal cases, it is not clear that returning the display would pass the new legal test.\n\"I'm worried we're opening ourselves up to litigation that could be very costly, and I think there's a lot of legal uncertainty. I recognize this is a very fast-changing landscape,\" she said.\nSenate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, spoke briefly as he voted for the measure.\n\"I just think that the Ten Commandments are historical documents, almost kind of a secular code of conduct, very fitting to place them here,\" he said.\nLawmakers prepare bills for a final push next week\nFRANKFORT — The 2025 legislative session is winding closer to sine die, and a heap of legislation is stacked up near the goal post after lawmakers worked into the evening this week to count votes and polish up bills for final action in the coming days.\nMajor bills on college sports, campus diversity programs, learner's permits, government efficiency, freestanding birthing centers and Kentucky's film industry were all gaining ground throughout the week, along with a late-breaking proposal on cannabis-infused drinks.\nThe beverages bill – Senate Bill 202 – calls for state regulations on intoxicating drinks derived from cannabis that have begun appearing in gas stations and vape shops.\nIt would grant the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control authority over the licensing, distribution, and retail sale of cannabis-infused beverages, using a three-tier system similar to the one for alcohol. The legislation would also limit the amount of intoxicating cannabinoids in such drinks – sometimes referred to as \"weed water.\"\nSB 202 cleared a committee vote late Wednesday and passed off the Senate floor Friday after the sponsor removed a moratorium on the sale of such products that had appeared in an earlier version of the bill.\nProponents said the products are not approved by the FDA and that additional oversight is needed to protect consumers, particularly children, from exposure to THC, the psychoactive chemical in cannabis. Critics largely agreed that regulations are needed, but said they would like to take more time to work through the proposal.\nThe bill now heads to the House.\nMeanwhile, one of the most watched bills from this year's session – House Bill 4 – has been sent to the Senate.\nThe measure would prohibit diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at public postsecondary institutions. Specifically, it would forbid differential treatment in hiring, admissions, scholarships and other areas based on religion, race, sex, color or national origin.\nAmong several other provisions, the bill would also prevent campuses from requiring or incentivizing students to in participate in D.E.I. training, and it would prohibit institutions from using resources on D.E.I. training, offices and initiatives.\nThe legislation cleared the House Committee on Postsecondary Education on Tuesday and advanced off the House floor Wednesday 81-18 following impassioned debate over the impact of D.E.I. initiatives on students and staff.\nHB 4 has been assigned to the Senate Education Committee for potential action next week.\nAmid all the debates, two of the Senate's priority bills have continued to move forward with relative ease.\nSenate Bill 1 would establish the Kentucky Film Office to administer the state's film incentive program, help market the state to the film industry and develop workforce training. The bill cleared the Senate on Tuesday with a unanimous vote.\nSenate Bill 3, which would update Kentucky's name, image and likeness law for college athletes, also cleared the Senate floor Tuesday without opposition and moved out of the House Committee on Economic Development and Workforce Investment on Thursday.\nThe legislation would align Kentucky's law – adopted in 2022 – with national standards, particularly in the aftermath of the House v. NCAA court case, which could open the door to universities directly compensating student athletes.\nIn addition, a long-discussed measure on freestanding birthing centers has won renewed support in the House.\nHouse Bill 90 would create a legal framework for freestanding birthing centers to operate in Kentucky. The House Committee on Licensing, Occupations, and Administrative Regulations passed the bill Wednesday, and it cleared the House on Thursday 82-9.\nThe general assembly has debated the issue for years, but the concept appears to be gaining support for a potential breakthrough in 2025, and a similar measure has already passed the Senate.\nMany other bills were on the move this week. Here's a look at some of the legislation making headway:\nSquatting – House Bill 10 seeks to crack down on squatting by providing a more concrete procedure for property owners and law enforcement to quickly remove unauthorized occupants from private property. It would also spell out criminal penalties for squatters who damage property. The House passed the legislation Tuesday.\nFinancial Literacy – House Bill 342 would require high school students to earn one credit in a financial literacy course before graduation. The bill cleared the House on Tuesday.\nGift Card Scams – Under Senate Bill 130, individuals who tamper with gift cards with the intention to steal funds could face a class D felony charge. The Senate passed the bill Tuesday.\nGovernment Efficiency – Senate Bill 257 would create the Office of Government Efficiency within the state auditor's office. The agency would evaluate and make recommendations to improve the efficiency and performance of state offices and programs. The bill cleared the Senate State and Local Government Committee on Monday and the Senate floor on Wednesday.\nTerroristic Threatening – Under House Bill 621, parents could face fines if their children are adjudicated for terroristic threatening and the threat caused law enforcement to incur an excessive cost during the response. The House Primary and Secondary Education Committee passed the measure Wednesday.\nLearner's Permits – House Bill 15 would reduce the minimum age for getting a learner's permit in Kentucky from 16 to 15 years old. The Senate Transportation Committee voted in favor of the bill Wednesday.\nChevron Deference – Under Senate Bill 84, courts could no longer defer to a state agency's interpretation when dealing with ambiguity in statutes, administrative regulations or orders, a practice known as Chevron deference. The bill on Wednesday cleared the House Committee on Licensing, Occupations, and Administrative Regulations.\nCigar Bars – House Bill 211 would create a regulatory framework for cigar bars and allow the establishments to operate in communities that otherwise prohibit public smoking as long as the establishments meet certain conditions in the legislation. The Senate State and Local Government Committee approved HB 211 on Wednesday.\nInsurance Fraud – Senate Bill 24 would expand the definition of property and casualty insurance fraud to help crack down on unscrupulous contractors and public adjusters who charge unnecessary or fraudulent fees. The House Banking and Insurance Committee passed the bill Wednesday.\nPersonal Image Rights – Senate Bill 7 would create legal protections to ensure that an image of a person's unclothed body cannot be used for commercial purposes without explicit consent. The Senate passed the measure Wednesday.\nSchool Bus Cameras – Senate Bill 38 would allow school districts to install camera systems on school buses to help combat stop-arm violations. A portion of the fines from violations would be transferred to school districts to help cover the cost of the cameras. The bill cleared the Senate floor Wednesday.\nChildhood Hearing Loss – Senate Bill 93 would require all health benefit plans to provide coverage for hearing aids and related services for children with hearing loss. The Senate passed the measure Wednesday.\nStreet Racing – House Bill 465 aims to curb illegal street racing with tougher penalties for offenders. Violations would result in a $1,000 fine for the first offense and a $2,000 fine for subsequent offenses. Violators could also have their car seized, and for a second offense, spend up to 30 days in jail. The House passed the legislation Wednesday.\nConversion Therapy – House Bill 495 would nullify an executive order that the governor issued in September regarding conversion therapy. The governor's order banned the use of any state and federal funds on conversion therapy for minors and called on state officials to report practitioners of conversion therapy to licensing boards for potential discipline. The House voted in support of the bill Wednesday.\nConcealed Weapons – Senate Bill 75 would lower the age requirement to carry a concealed deadly weapon from 21 to 18. The Senate Judiciary Committee passed the measure Thursday.\nProtective Orders – House Bill 38 would create tougher penalties for people who repeatedly violate protective orders. Offenders would face a class D felony if they violate an order three times within five years and the third violation involves the use or threat of violence. The Senate Judiciary Committee advanced HB 38 on Thursday.\nDrone Surveillance – House Bill 19 aims to protect Kentuckians from unauthorized drone surveillance when they have a reasonable expectation of privacy. It would allow a person who is subjected to unauthorized surveillance to initiate a civil action in court. The bill received a green light from the Senate Committee on Economic Development, Tourism and Labor on Thursday.\nKentucky History Month – House Bill 313 would designate June of each year as Kentucky History Month. The Senate Committee on Economic Development, Tourism and Labor passed the measure Thursday.\nKentucky DOGE – House Concurrent Resolution 50 would establish the Kentucky Discipline of Government Efficiency Task Force to examine executive branch expenditures, identify opportunities to increase efficiency in government operations, and inform the biennial budget preparation process. The House State Government Committee advanced the bill Thursday.\nMoments of Silence in Schools – Senate Bill 19 would require public schools to hold a moment of silence and reflection for students at the start of the school day. The bill won support from the House State Government Committee on Thursday.\nSchool Panic Alerts – House Bill 14 would allow school districts to implement wearable panic alert systems for teachers, administrators and staff. The systems provide a portable panic button that, when activated, sends a silent distress signal to emergency responders. The House passed the bill Thursday.\nTeacher and Student Communications – Senate Bill 181 would require Kentucky school districts to implement policies for using only traceable forms of communication between staff, coaches, and volunteers and their students. The Senate Committee on Families and Children passed the legislation Tuesday, and the bill cleared the Senate on Thursday.\nDisaster Prevention Task Force – Senate Concurrent Resolution 67 would establish the Disaster Prevention and Resiliency Task Force to study disaster mitigation, risk assessment, infrastructure resilience, and planning for natural disasters that impact the state. The Senate Veterans and Military Affairs Committee passed the bill Monday, and the Senate gave the resolution a green light Thursday.\nConscience Objections in Health Care – Senate Bill 132 would prohibit discrimination against health care professionals who decline to perform certain procedures that violate their consciences. The bill includes some exceptions for emergency care and sexual assault examinations. The Senate Health Services Committee advanced the measure Monday, and it passed the Senate on Friday.\nSexual Assault Response Training – House Bill 219 would require medical providers in emergency departments to receive sexual assault response training. The bill received approval from the Senate Health Services Committee on Monday and cleared the Senate floor Friday.\nSexual Extortion – Senate Bill 73 seeks to clamp down on sexual extortion by creating tougher penalties for offenders and more legal remedies for victims. It also requires schools and colleges to educate students and parents about the issue and display resources for reporting. The bill won support from the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and advanced off the House floor Friday.\nInterfering with a Legislative Proceeding – House Bill 399 would create criminal penalties, ranging from a class B misdemeanor to the class D felony, for interfering with a legislative proceeding if the intent is to prevent the general assembly from conducting business. The House passed the bill Friday.\nThe general assembly is scheduled to gavel in on Tuesday for day 25 of the 30-day session. If lawmakers want a chance to override potential vetoes from the governor, they will need to finalized legislation by March 14.\nKentuckians can track the action this year through Legislative Record webpage, which allows users to read bills and follow their progression through the chambers.\nCitizens can also share their views on issues with lawmakers by calling the General Assembly's toll-free message line at 1-800-372-7181.\nFRANKFORT — Kentucky lawmakers say cannabis-infused beverages – sometimes known as \"weed water\" – have been on their radar since last September. On Friday, the Senate advanced a bill that would seek to regulate the products.\nSenate Bill 202 calls for cannabis-infused beverages to fall under the authority of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control for the purposes of licensing, distribution, and retail sales. The bill proposes using a three-tier system similar to the one for alcohol.\nThe bill's sponsor, Sen. Julie Raque Adams, R-Louisville, said there has been proliferation of the products at gas stations, liquor stores and vape shops recently.\n\"These cannabis-infused beverages are the result of a loophole in the 2018 federal farm bill that reauthorized the growing of hemp in our country. It didn't take long for someone to quickly figure out you can extract the THC and that's the delta-9 and put it in a whole host of products,\" she said.\nThe Senate advanced the bill with a 29-6 vote, and it now heads to the House.\nThe legislation spells out what qualifies as a \"cannabis-infused\" beverage. According to the bill, it is a properly permitted, adult-use cannabinoid liquid intended for human consumption that has intoxicating properties that change the function of the nervous system and result in alterations of perception, cognition or behavior.\nSB 202 would limit the level of intoxicating cannabinoids in the drinks to 5 milligrams. Adams said one manufacturer states on the company's website that a 10-milligram beverage can is equal to four glasses of wine or four shots of 80 proof vodka.\nAdams said there are several cannabinoid products that have nonintoxicating properties, and the bill is silent on all of them. It also doesn't contain a tax provision because it's unconstitutional for the Senate to impose a new tax or revenue measure.\nOne provision of the bill calls on the University of Kentucky Cannabis Center to study and report to the legislature on the manufacturing, testing procedures, distribution, sale and consumer effects of cannabis-infused beverages.\nCritics of the bill agreed that some level of regulation is needed for the beverages, but they raised concerns about uncertainties in the proposal's language.\nSenate Minority Whip David Yates, D-Louisville, voted no on the bill, and said it's possible some of the products might seem to have a higher level of THC, but have fewer intoxicating effects.\n\"I think that most everyone would agree there's got to be regulations in place. I'm all for that. I think they should be regulated, taxed and made sure that we continue to put sections in place that only adults are getting these beverages,\" he said.\nSen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville, said the industry is now legal, and legislators should hear from stakeholders so there won't be unintended consequences from enacted legislation.\nBut Sen. Gary Boswell, R-Owensboro, said products with THC that exceed federal law should be confiscated.\n\"If you give them an inch, they'll take a mile. Suddenly, the products that exceed the federal law on THC content have flooded our market. I believe that all these illegal products should be confiscated. No bill's perfect,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — The Kentucky House of Representatives advanced a bill on Friday that would make interference of legislative proceedings a misdemeanor in most circumstances.\nRep. John Blanton, R-Salyersville, is the primary sponsor of House Bill 399. He said the bill is the result of an incident from the 2023 legislative session where protestors in the House gallery caused a loud disruption that impeded the legislature's ability to do its job.\n\"(The bill) will ensure that the general assembly has an opportunity to legislate without interference from people who wish to prevent us from doing our work on behalf of our constituents,\" Blanton said.\nBlanton said the executive branch and judicial branches of state government have similar powers when it comes to curtailing certain disruptions.\n\"Judges have the power to deal with interruptions in their courtroom by use of criminal contempt proceedings,\" Blanton said as an example of how the bill would give the legislature similar protections.\nUnder HB 399, a person would be guilty of second-degree interference of a legislative proceeding if they enter or remain inside a chamber or gallery of the general assembly or another room being used for the general assembly with the intent to impede or prevent the legislature from conducting business.\nThe second-degree provision would also apply if a person obstructs or impedes a legislator, legislative officer or legislative staff member from movement within a legislative building.\nSecond-degree interference of a legislative proceeding would be a class B misdemeanor on the first offense and a class A misdemeanor on the second or subsequent offense.\nA person would be guilty of first-degree interference of a legislative proceeding if they knowingly engage, conspire, or facilitate another person to engage in disorderly or disruptive conduct in a legislative building or they personally disrupt, impede or prevent the general assembly from conducting business, Blanton said.\nFirst-degree interference of a legislative proceeding would be a class A misdemeanor until the third or subsequent offense. Violators would then face a class D felony charge.\nAn earlier version of HB 399 called for a class D felony at the second or subsequent offense. The House adopted a floor amendment from Rep. T.J. Roberts, R-Burlington, on Friday that changed that provision to read \"third\" instead of second.\n\"I would hope a third offense never happens … However, I think that having that third offense in is a preferable way to do it,\" Roberts said.\nRoberts's amendment would also clarify that nothing in the legislation could be construed to prohibit the public from assembling in traditional public forums in the Capitol Rotunda, Capitol grounds or other areas of the Kentucky State Capitol campus.\nThe provision is essential \"to ensure we are focused on the areas where we are conducting the people's business,\" he said.\nAdditionally, the amendment clarifies that a peace officer may arrest violators and remove violators at the request of the Speaker of the House, sergeant-at-arms, Senate President or committee chair.\nBlanton said he does not intend for HB 399 to impede on constitutional rights.\n\"This is the people's house,\" he said. \"They have the right to come here and protest. That's their First Amendment right.\"\nRep. Anne Gay Donworth, D-Lexington, said there are times when constituents travel to Frankfort to testify in a committee or speak to their legislator and are unable to. When that happens, those people are often frustrated and use their voice in other ways in order to be heard.\n\"But for people not be able to speak appropriately, and then be criminalized for using their voice here, I don't believe that's right,\" Donworth said. \"I don't believe that's what our founders intended, and I would ask people to please vote 'no' on this.\"\nAs the chair of the House Natural Resources and Energy Committee. Rep. Jim Gooch Jr., R-Providence, said he tries to make sure everyone's viewpoint is heard during a committee meeting, but time or circumstances do not always allow for that.\nHe said constituents have the right to visit and contact their legislator, advocate for an issue and have access to legislation and meetings, but nothing guarantees that a constituent can speak during a committee meeting.\n\"We all agree that people should get involved in the process, and the best way to encourage that is to try to give people time to speak. But, again, I cannot emphasize enough that nothing in the process guarantees your right to speak in committee,\" Gooch said.\nHB 399 advanced off the House floor by a 68-26 vote. It now heads to the Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A resolution to create a task force to examine executive branch spending advanced from the House State Government Committee on Thursday.\nRep. T.J. Roberts, R- Burlington, and Rep. John Hodgson, R-Fisherville, are the primary co-sponsors of House Concurrent Resolution 50.\n\"House Concurrent Resolution 50 establishes the Kentucky Discipline of Government Efficiency Task Force, which is an interim committee to examine our financial practices, particularly the executive branch,\" Roberts said. \"Further, the (resolution) makes clear that our focus will be on the transition to zero-based budgeting.\"\nAccording to the legislation, the 10-member task force, also known as KY DOGE, would meet at least twice a month during the 2025 interim of the Kentucky General Assembly. The task force's findings would be considered in the biennial budget drafting process in 2026.\nThe resolution would require the task force to report its findings no later than Oct. 1, 2025.\nRoberts said the KY DOGE Task Force would \"ensure that when we are spending the people's money through our tax system, that it is done in an efficient manner.\"\nHodgson said he spent four years during former Gov. Matt Bevin's administration working on a similar effort that was successful.\n\"In the span of four years, we were able to cut out 200 unneeded boards and commissions,\" Hodgson said. \"We downsized the workforce by about 10% — more than 3,000 people — without any reduction in service … The government not only survived, but was doing better at the end of that process. I think there are many more opportunities.\"\nCommittee chair Rep. David Hale, R-Wellington, asked who would make up the 10 members of the committee.\nRoberts said there would be four House Republicans, four Senate Republicans, one House Democrat and one Senate Democrat on the task force.\n\"This would compose it similar to what the partisan make up of our current body is,\" Roberts said, adding the members would be appointed through the regular committee appointment process.\nThe Kentucky General Assembly has budget review subcommittees that meet throughout the year to examine certain areas of the budget, like education and transportation spending. Rep. Matthew Lehman, D-Newport, asked Roberts and Hodgson how the KY DOGE Task Force would be different from that subcommittee process.\nRoberts said the focus of the task force would be to examine the funding base.\n\"The budget review subcommittees, they are focusing on specific parts of the budget that we are already voting on, that we are already having legislative oversight,\" he added.\nLehman said a legislative report from 2001 on zero-based budgeting compared to performance based-budgeting already exists.\n\"I'm just not exactly sure what (the task force) is going to accomplish that isn't being accomplished by the current budget process and our interim joint budget review subcommittees,\" he added.\nRep. James Tipton, R-Taylorsville, said that as the former chair for the Budget Review Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education, he believes the task force would be helpful.\n\"Nobody ever looks at what's in the base,\" Tipton said. \"And the question is, are there things in that base that maybe aren't working? If they're working well, if they're providing services, we need to keep them.\n\"But if there are things in that base that are not productive, that are not beneficial to the citizens of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, maybe we need to cut them out and reinvest those funds in areas where they can truly benefit the commonwealth.\"\nHCR 50 advanced from the House State Government Committee by a 16-3 vote with one pass vote. It now goes before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A bill that seeks to lower the age to carry concealed deadly weapons in Kentucky was green lighted Thursday during a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting.\nSponsored by Sen. Aaron Reed, R-Shelbyville, Senate Bill 75 would lower the age requirement from 21 to 18. He said the bill is about fairness, constitutional rights and the ability of young adults to protect themselves just like any other law-abiding citizen.\n\"At 18-years-old, a Kentuckian is legally an adult. They can vote. They can sign contracts. They can marry. They can be tried as an adult in court, and most importantly, they can serve in the United States military,\" Reed said.\nReed said the current age requirement is an \"unjust double standard, one that must be corrected.\"\nSome people may argue that lowering the conceal carry age would make it easier for kids to get guns, but the bill doesn't change who can legally purchase a firearm, Reed said.\n\"Federal law still applies. Background checks still apply. Nothing in this bill weakens or changes our existing gun purchasing laws. It simply ensures that those who are already legally allowed to own a firearm are given the same rights to carry it responsibly, just as they would at 21,\" he said.\nReed testified that in January, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled it's unconstitutional to deny 18 to 20-year-olds the right to purchase firearms.\n\"If we acknowledge that they have the right to own a firearm, then why are we denying them the ability to carry one for their own protection?\"\nAlso testifying in favor of the bill was Taylor McKee of the National Rifle Association.\n\"Young adults 18-20 are among the people protected by the Second Amendment, and they should not be barred or discriminated against from carrying firearms for self-defense,\" he said.\nSpeaking against the measure was Sen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah. He asked if 18-year-olds and military members can openly carry deadly weapons. McKee answered yes, eliciting a response from Carroll.\n\"I think it's important to note that I personally do not see anything to gain by passing this bill, and that's from 24 years of law enforcement officer,\" he said.\nCarroll also said he's a supporter of the Second Amendment, but was concerned when training requirements were eliminated from Kentucky's concealed carry law several years ago.\n\"My entire adult life as a law enforcement officer, I was trained regularly to know how and when to shoot that gun,\" he said. \"The idea of people carrying a concealed weapon who may not even know how to shoot that weapon is terrifying. And I think we went too far there, and I think this is another step where we had gone too far.\"\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald L. Thomas, D-Lexington, said the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals made clear that states could implement different rules for certain ages regarding how the weapons are carried, training requirements and the qualifications to purchase them.\n\"We're not required by that Fifth Circuit decision to say that 18-year-olds can carry concealed weapons. Kentucky could still differentiate that Fifth Circuit decision between 18 and 20-year-olds in terms of having the rights to carry concealed weapons,\" he asked McKee, who confirmed it would not be binding.\nSenate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, spoke in favor of the bill, explaining how his father and uncles served in the military when they were young, along with his 19-year-old son who left college after two years to enlist in the Marine Corps.\n\"I think those instances show that we have within the recognition of the United States government and the state government that teenagers are able to defend our country,\" he said. \"And therefore, they should be able to purchase a weapon and carry it as any other adult because at 18, our laws recognize them as such.\"\nThe bill now heads to the full Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A measure that calls for accountability and transparency in state government advanced out of the Kentucky Senate on Wednesday with a 32-6 vote.\nSenate Bill 257 would create the Office of Government Efficiency within the state auditor's office to conduct performance audits and fiscal reviews of state agencies, according to the bill's sponsor, Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield.\n\"This bill is a continuing effort of fiscal responsibility. Since 2016, the general assembly has implemented fiscally conservative principles and policies that have led to the largest surplus in state history,\" Tichenor said.\nThe measure also calls for monitoring implementation of efficiency-related recommendations and reporting findings annually to the governor and the Legislative Research Commission, she said.\nSB 257 would provide the state auditor's office with access to certain restricted funds for hiring staff as necessary. Long-term funding would come through appropriations from the general assembly and through any federal grants earmarked for government efficiency, Tichenor said.\nSen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville, spoke against the measure, stating that the state needs Kentucky solutions to Kentucky problems.\n\"My concerns with this bill start, although they don't end, with the title. And I know a title is just words, but these are words that have been intentionally chosen to invoke what is happening in Washington, D.C. under the federal DOGE program,\" she said.\nChambers Armstrong said when she looks at the bill, it makes her think that the goal of the legislation is to bring that \"same chaos\" to Kentucky.\nSen. Michael J. Nemes, R-Shepherdsville, said he was also concerned that the general assembly is copying the federal government. However, he suggested that the federal government look at what Kentucky has done.\n\"The feds need to look at us. And like the senator from Jefferson also said, this is something that isn't new, but it hasn't been utilized since auditor Crit Luallen, a Democrat, years ago. She was touted for what she did because she did a great job. We again want to do that great job,\" he said.\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald L. Thomas, D-Lexington, voted against the bill and said the federal Department of Government Efficiency is politically charged.\n\"And what's come out of it we've seen in the last four months is chaos, confusion, a loss of jobs and uncertainty and a great deal of social unrest. I would not like to see that duplicated here in Kentucky,\" he said.\nHowever, Sen. Gex Williams, R-Verona, said the efforts would be a good use of money, and the state auditor's office is different than the federal one.\n\"The auditor is a constitutional officer. She has, or he has, a constitutional authority to do something and we, I think as a legislature, have a constitutional responsibility to fund that function that the auditor has,\" he said.\nThe bill now heads to the House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A bill that would lower the age for youth to acquire an instruction permit for driving unanimously cleared the Senate Transportation Committee on Wednesday.\nHouse Majority Floor Leader Steven Rudy, R-Paducah, said the proposed legislation would allow teenagers to get a permit once they turn 15. At age 16, they would be eligible to take a driver's test for an intermediate permit if they have had at least six months of training.\nRudy said some young people might choose to delay or decline to get a driver's license, but for many young people, these aren't options.\n\"I think a lot of parents will say I'm better off getting an Uber or a Lyft for my kid than getting another car and taking out that insurance. And that's fine if they want to do that. But those kids, particularly in rural Kentucky that don't have those third-party ride platforms, I think this is going to be good experience for them,\" he said.\nRudy brought Brooks Young, a 14-year-old boy from Franklin County, who testified that he's excited about learning how to drive and become more independent.\n\"I'm here on behalf of every soon-to-be 15-year-old in Kentucky. House Bill 15 is an opportunity to provide significant benefits to our communities, families and businesses in every Kentucky county,\" he said.\nMany 15-year-olds are already balancing school work, part-time jobs, sports and activities. This demonstrates their ability to manage their time, Young said.\n\"Allowing them to begin driving under controlled, safe and structured conditions offers an opportunity to further develop these crucial life skills,\" he said. \"House Bill 15 would boost the local workforce. Teens who are able to drive will be more likely to access job opportunities and contribute to the economy.\"\nAllowing teens to get their permits at 15 would also provide more chances for the parents to guide, monitor and teach, Young added.\nRudy said the bill would maintain the intermediate license process for 16-year-olds. Drivers could apply for a full operator's license at 17 if they have held an intermediate license for 180 days.\nSen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester, said he is in favor of 15-year-old youth having the opportunity to drive, and allowing this will bring Kentucky in line with surrounding states. He also said he hopes the measure will help energize young people to want to get driver's licenses.\n\"I too drove at 15 years old when I was growing up. I didn't have any problems or any issues,\" he said.\nSen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville, said she has two little boys, and the thought of them driving before they reach the age of 30 gives her heart palpitations.\n\"However, what I like about this bill is I like the added training requirements. But I do believe that allowing our young people more opportunities to learn will make them safer drivers when they are eventually out on their own,\" she said.\nSen. Brandon J. Storm, R-London, thanked Rudy for the bill and spoke in favor of it.\n\"My son's going to turn 16 next month, and I just wish we could have passed this last year so he would have a full year of experience driving,\" he said.\nCommittee Chair Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, said it's important to give the driver licensing regional offices help to deal with the influx of 15-year-olds who seek to drive.\n\"It will put an extra strain on our regional offices to get these permits out. We have legislation coming your way. Please watch for that and help us out on this,\" he told Rudy.\nRudy responded that he and others have been in contact with staff of the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet.\n\"We hear them loud and clearly. The regional driver's license has been an issue that I think everybody acknowledges. I also think that's going to work itself out in time, but we're looking at ways we can help get through this period of backlog and hopefully take care of this,\" he said.\nThe bill now heads to the full Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — Parents of children adjudicated for terroristic threatening could be fined under House Bill 621.\nThe House Primary and Secondary Education Committee advanced the legislation on Wednesday. Rep. Robert Duvall, R-Bowling Green, is the primary sponsor of the bill.\n\"House Bill 621 simply allows the courts the option to impose a fine to the parents of the child based upon the determination that law enforcement incurred excessive cost responding to the offense,\" Duvall said. \"It also puts the child in contact with the mental health professional.\"\nStudies show that disengaged or negligent parents are often the cause for delinquency and minors committing major crimes, Duvall said.\n\"This will create a safer society we can all be proud of. But when parents are not parenting, they must be held accountable,\" he added. \"And House Bill 621 does just that.\"\nSteve Chappell, who serves as the Warren County Safe Schools Administrator through the Warren County Sheriff's Office, testified alongside Duvall.\nHe told the committee that threats against schools \"spread like wildfire\" and require a lot of resources to investigate.\n\"I have to pull resources from other schools to go to that school the threat was directed at and that leaves our other schools vulnerable,\" Chappell said. \"Not only that, if it's an online threat, we have to track down who the user was, what the handle was, and then we have to get federal agencies involved a lot of times. FBI and Homeland Security assist us with that.\"\nChappell said more tools are needed when it comes holding people accountable for terroristic threatening against schools.\n\"With this bill, I think that it would help,\" he added. \"… This would hold the parents accountable to some degree as far as checking their students' phones and seeing what they're looking at.\"\nRep. Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, asked if there are any other state laws that fine parents for a crime their child commits. Duvall said he wasn't aware of any.\nRep. Josh Calloway, R-Irvington, said he had the same question as Bojanowski and some other concerns about the bill.\nCalloway said he worries the bill doesn't take into consideration parents of adopted children or foster children who are dealing with reactive attachment disorder and other parents who are aware and actively helping their child.\n\"It just seems like (the bill's language) is extremely open and allows for just a lot of leeway in the judicial system to decide what they think, instead of us telling them specifically in statute this is how you can charge and when you can charge,\" Calloway said.\nDuvall said HB 621 is not a mandate.\n\"This legislation would simply allow the courts to look at this as an option,\" he said. \"… This is not a 'shall' it is a 'may.'\"\nRep. Lisa Willner, D-Louisville, also had concerns about the language of the legislation. She said she understands terroristic threatening in schools is a serious issue, but asked about \"the child shall be detained\" provision and if it would allow for diversion programs.\nDuvall said his intent for the bill would be for the child to be assessed by a mental health professional and referred to counseling and other services if needed.\nWillner said she is \"100% behind\" that idea, and asked Duvall if he would be willing to work on an amendment to make that intention clearer in the legislation. Duvall said he would look into that.\nRep. Steve Riley, R-Glasgow, also spoke on the mental health aspect of threats in schools. He told the committee about a student who recently died by suicide in his district who may have been influenced by online behavior.\n\"We're having our young people's lives destroyed because of threats that are being made, whether they be online or at school or whatever they may be,\" Riley said. \"As a society, we've got to start holding people accountable, whether they're teenagers who know better or their parents for activities that harm our students, and in many cases, the people who work at our schools.\"\nThe committee approved HB 621 by a 10-2 vote with five pass votes.\nRep. James Tipton, R-Taylorsville, said he thinks parents are responsible for the actions of their children.\n\"I think this is a very appropriate first step, and I appreciate you for bringing it Representative Duvall,\" he added.\nHB 621 now goes before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A bill that seeks to boost Kentucky's film industry received unanimous approval from the Senate on Tuesday after supporters said the state's charm and natural beauty provide major draws for filmmaking.\nSen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, said the proposed legislation will centralize efforts to attract movie producers to Kentucky and spur the economy. The Kentucky film, motion picture and sound recording industry generated $200 million in revenues in 2022, and in turn, probably helped other businesses in the state garner another $128 million, he said.\nThe legislation would establish the Kentucky Film Office within the state Cabinet for Economic Development. It would also create the Kentucky Film Leadership Council and call on state tourism, labor and economic development officials to develop comprehensive film industry strategies.\n\"Senate Bill 1 is Kentucky's effort to bring itself to the world through the motion picture film industry. For many years, Kentucky has had in place some of the most generous film tax incentives in the entire country,\" Wheeler said. \"And yet we have not fully taken advantage of a job employment and economic opportunities that film production has for the commonwealth.\"\nAt the heart of the bill is a centralized infrastructure plan to capitalize on the full potential of film production. The film office would serve as a hub for marketing, industry coordination, and workforce development and solidify Kentucky's position as an attractive destination for film production, he said.\n\"A dedicated Kentucky film office will help maximize incentives, track major productions and remove unnecessary roadblocks for filmmakers. And why do we know this will bring economic success in Kentucky? We've seen other examples, perhaps most notably Georgia, which has formed a multi-billion-dollar industry based upon film production as well as film tourism,\" Wheeler said.\nStaff at the film office would work closely with local and regional film offices and tourism offices to streamline permitting and market Kentucky as a prime location for film production.\nThey also would assist the state's production companies in navigating the Kentucky Entertainment Incentive Program and facilitate the development of a skilled workforce in collaboration with film studios and training programs, he said.\nAlso speaking in favor of the measure was bill co-sponsor Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester. He shared stories with other legislators about naysayers, but said Kentucky is in fact drawing interest from filmmakers.\nStivers pointed out that Asbury University in Wilmore is probably one of the leading postsecondary institutions in the nation for steering people to pursue careers in film and television production.\nHe said he received calls over the weekend from people on the west coast who want to negotiate coming to Kentucky to work.\n\"What more can we do for creating an environment for diversification, education and economic development than creating a coordinating body that the secretary and his staff and us as policy makers recognize as quite the viable entity to project us into a realm that we have not been in and been competitive because we lack this structure,\" he said.\nSen. Shelley Funke Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, called the measure a \"workforce attraction\" bill and perhaps one of the biggest things the legislature will do for decades.\n\"This is an invitation to all of our Kentuckians to find a place, to find a home,\" she said mentioning that many people in the film industry work in support roles and aren't actors.\nSen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, said her house was used for filming last January. Sixty-five people in a crew filmed scenes for an upcoming movie featuring Al Pacino.\nSenate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, added that in 1992, there were nearly 800 people in Henderson and Evansville filming \"A League of Their Own,\" and it had a tremendous economic impact on Hendersonville and the tri-state area.\n\"I want to thank the senators for their sponsorship of this and look forward to the growth in tourism to come,\" he said.\nThe bill now heads to the House.\nFRANKFORT — Legislators on the Senate Families and Children Committee unanimously approved a bill Tuesday that would require Kentucky's public school districts to implement policies for using only traceable forms of communication between staff, coaches, and volunteers and their students.\nSen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, testified during a meeting that Senate Bill 181 would put standards in place that protect the education profession and the proper relationships between students and those in authority. It would also return previously existing safeguards that protect children and their families, she said.\nTichenor asked committee members to recall their adolescent years and the old communication methods they most likely used. She said the lines that delineated proper relationships between authority and students have been diminished.\n\"Can you imagine or think of a time when a school volunteer or a teacher or a coach called you up just to chat privately? How would that have gone over with your family? Probably not well. It would have been quite awkward,\" she said.\nTichenor said she has a stack of concerning stories in a folder from Kentucky counties.\n\"And they're just a sampling of a few that make it into the news, and I will tell you, it crosses our state entirely,\" she said.\nUnder SB 181, employees and volunteers would be required to report known direct, private communications at which point parents would be notified and the district will proceed with the appropriate action, Tichenor testified.\nThere's also a provision in the bill that would protect the anonymity of minors during an investigation by the Education Professional Standards Board. SB 181 would also extend the time for investigations of a sexual nature to 120 days, Tichenor said.\nStacy Briscoe of Anderson County testified in favor of the bill, stating that her then-16-year-old daughter had interactions with an employee at Anderson County High School without parental consent. The communication included several text messages, she said.\n\"Please, put yourself in our parental shoes. Completely oblivious to an adult having unlimited, uncensored contact with our minor child,\" Briscoe said.\nAshley Nation also testified, and said she is not only an advocate for student safety, but also a survivor of educator sexual abuse.\n\"As a student, I was targeted by a teacher who used in-person and electronic communications to groom and manipulate me. What began as seemingly harmless conversations and messages soon escalated into a situation where I felt trapped, vulnerable and unable to seek help,\" she said.\nSen. Shelley Funke Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, said she's an active volunteer in the Roman Catholic program, Protecting God's Children. She said abuse of students is a terrible problem, and asked where the term traceable communication is defined.\n\"We actually have that defined in the bill, but we will clarify that a little bit as well,\" Tichenor said. \"Traceable communication could be old-school, like a parent's note, a communication that's on paper that can be traced. Email can be traceable, and there are so many apps they use these days...\"\nSen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, asked Tichenor if she knows if schools already have policies about communications between school employees and students.\n\"There are some ethical standards, but I'm not seeing that they're being followed or they're not being disciplined if they're not being followed,\" she said.\nSen. Gex Williams, R-Verona, asked Tichenor if there's a requirement, for example, for a teacher to report another teacher if direct communication is observed. He asked if it would fall under the requirement to report.\n\"It absolutely would, and we do specify in the language of the bill that if someone knows that there's direct communication happening, they have a duty to report that,\" she said.\nSen. Matthew Deneen, R-Elizabethtown, commented about platforms teachers use for communication and said he is in favor of the bill.\n\"The bill that you put together says that they must have one, and that's an issue that I would say that I would like to see addressed a little bit wider in this bill because there are multiple platforms out there that are trackable that schools use from their athletic department to their teachers,\" he said.\nTichenor said there will be a floor amendment to address the platforms.\nSen. Rick Girdler, R-Somerset, said he could have been convinced of anything in high school, and he would have been willing to run into a wall if his coach asked him to do it.\n\"I thank God every day that I was raised in the 50s and 60s, not in the 20s. But we send our kids to get an education, not to be abused or used,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — A bill that would prohibit diversity, equity and inclusion (D.E.I.) initiatives at public postsecondary institutions cleared its first hurdle in the 2025 legislative session.\nThe House Postsecondary Education Committee advanced House Bill 4 on Tuesday. Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, said the measure would end an unconstitutional practice in Kentucky and make public postsecondary education more accessible for all students. She is the primary sponsor of the legislation.\nDecker said HB 4 would \"ensure our postsecondary system in Kentucky is held accountable\" and would \"dismantle the failed and misguided D.E.I. bureaucracies that have made our colleges more divided, more expensive and less tolerant.\"\nHB 4 is the result of a 2023 Supreme Court ruling on the issue, Decker added.\nFor public postsecondary institutions, HB 4 would:\nThe Council on Postsecondary Education would also be prohibited from implementing D.E.I. initiatives.\nDecker said HB 4 would not threaten student centers.\n\"Critics misread this bill as threatening student centers and threatening support for veterans, first generation and low-income students – services that are explicitly and groups that are explicitly exempted from this bill,\" Decker said.\nTo ensure compliance, HB 4 would require the state auditor of public accounts to set up a process to review whether public institutions are abiding by the statute, Committee chair Rep. James Tipton, R-Taylorsville, said.\nThe review would take place every four years, and institutions would have 180 days to correct any violations.\n\"If the institution fails to cure the violation within that time, the institution shall be ineligible to receive formula funding increases … during the following fiscal year,\" Tipton said. \"There's also an ability for the institution to petition the attorney general if they disagree with the auditor on the issue.\"\nDecker said the goal of HB 4 is to foster critical thinking at public postsecondary institutions and correct a 14-year drop in enrollment from low income and underrepresented students.\n\"If education is to be the great equalizer in the commonwealth, the opportunity to obtain a college degree in our state must be equally available and affordable to all,\" she said.\nRep. Lisa Willner, D-Louisville, said it is \"a broad leap\" to suggest D.E.I. is the cause for a drop in enrollment among underrepresented students.\n\"If the D.E.I. initiatives are leaving some folks out, why don't we make these more inclusive rather than just get rid of them?\" she asked.\nDecker replied that she doesn't think D.E.I. caused a drop in enrollment, but it hasn't helped the issue either.\n\"If I were paying millions to help something not happen, and then it happened for 14 years, I would stop that spending,\" she added. \"I would be disgusted by the outcomes that I was not getting from what I was paying for.\"\nRep. George Brown Jr., D-Lexington, called HB 4 \"problematic\" and said Kentucky's history of discriminatory practices should be taken into consideration.\n\"The historical indicators of what has occurred, particularly with people who look like me, and other protected classes in our society – it's a really serious problem.\" Brown said. \"And I think we're trivializing it and that we're trying to say that this does not matter.\"\nBrown said he also has concerns about how HB 4 may violate federal Title IX and Title VI law.\nRep. Steven Doan, R-Erlanger, said he supports HB 4, but wished a private course of action provision in an early version of the bill remained in the current draft.\n\"I would like to see maybe a little more teeth to it, but I think you've done a great job on this,\" Doan said, adding he worries colleges and universities may ignore sections of the bill without the original language.\nThe House Postsecondary Education Committee approved HB 4 by an 11-4 vote.\nIn explaining his \"yes\" vote, Tipton said the debate on HB 4 has distracted from the goal of the legislation: student success.\n\"... We have to work to help every student succeed, no matter their situation in life,\" Tipton said. \"There are many extra wrap-around services that are needed, and that should be our goal. That should be where we focus on helping every student have the opportunity to succeed.\"\nHB 4 now goes before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — Lawmakers on the Senate Health Services Committee advanced a bill Monday that would prohibit discrimination against health care professionals who decline to perform procedures that violate their consciences.\nSen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville, called Senate Bill 132 \"commonsense,\" and said the bill would strengthen health care providers' rights and also set up civil remedies for people who feel they've been wronged.\n\"This bill is not a challenge to the social structure. It is not a policy bill. It is not a get out of jail free bill for those who decide that they don't want to fulfill their duties. What this bill is, it is a recruitment tool. It's an economic development tool,\" he said.\nDouglas said the pressure on Kentucky's health care system and those who work in it are tremendous. He said if the health care professionals don't have a choice regarding their sincerely held beliefs, it makes it more difficult for medical facilities to recruit competent health care providers in Kentucky.\n\"It is a tool that basically says welcome to the commonwealth. We really look forward to your business, and even though we expect the highest level of professionalism from you, we will honor your moral conscience as we do for all Kentuckians,\" he said.\nDouglas said there are some medical professionals who don't mind violating their own consciences when they want to complete procedures, but there are those who have strong beliefs. He also said institutions are protected at the federal level, but not individuals.\nThe legislation would give health care professionals the right to refuse to participate in any service that violates their conscience, and it would stipulate that professionals cannot be held, civilly, criminally or administratively liable in those circumstances. It also would prohibit discrimination against such professionals in hiring or licensing.\nSB 132 includes some exceptions, including instances in which health care professionals are required to provide emergency medical treatment or conduct examinations related to sexual assaults.\nThe bill sparked some lengthy debate during Monday's hearing.\nSen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, voted against the bill, and said it would lead to discrimination against patients.\n\"I know that we continue to hear the words individual civil rights and religious ethical beliefs. It's just very concerning to me that we continue to pass policy to say that people have individual civil rights basically to discriminate against folks and that we use words 'religious' and 'ethical beliefs' to allow that, so I'm going to be a no on this,\" she said.\nBut Senate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, voted for the measure, arguing that it specifically points out objections to procedures or particular health care services.\nLikewise, Sen. Michael J. Nemes, R-Shepherdsville, voted for SB 132.\n\"The way it was described, it's the medical procedure that you can object to, not any person or their belief or what they did to get there,\" he said.\nSen. Steve Rawlings, R-Burlington, concurred with Mills and Nemes.\n\"In the seven or so states that have this on the books, patients have not been turned away. So, it's so much more important to look at track records rather than theoreticals,\" he said.\nSeveral health care professionals and advocates also testified on the bill, including Dr. Miranda Bencomo, a pediatrician who said she strongly opposes the measure.\n\"While I do appreciate the goal of trying to recruit more providers, I fear that this bill does not actually add anything to achieve that goal. Instead, I feel that it opens the door to substandard care by allowing health professionals to deny services based on personal beliefs without accountability,\" she said.\nRepresentatives from the Fairness Campaign and Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates also raised concerns about discrimination in health care settings and exacerbating a shortage of obstetricians and gynecologists.\nHowever, one supporter, Paris physician Dr. Bill Wehrman, said patients would continue to get care if the bill is passed. He said Kentucky lacks specialists, paramedics and other health care workers and that the proposed legislation would provide a boost in attracting professionals to the state.\nRegistered nurse Lindsey Cox testified that her career has been affected by a lack of protection of her beliefs.\n\"As a nurse, when I was deciding what field of specialty I wanted to work in, I changed the direction due to ethical concerns about being forced to participate or being coerced to participate in procedures that would violate my conscience,\" she said.\nThe measure cleared the committee with an 8-1 vote and one pass. It now heads to the full Senate for consideration.\nKey bills on NIL, workplace safety and religious liberty move forward\nFRANKFORT — High-profile bills on religious freedom, college athletics and fluoride were all on the move this week as lawmakers passed a wave of bills out of committee and off the chamber floors in preparation for a busy two weeks ahead.\nFriday marked day 20 of this year's short, 30-day session, leaving just eight days on the calendar before the general assembly is scheduled to break for the veto recess. Legislators will need to finalize bills by March 14 if they want a chance to override potential vetoes from the governor.\nThe looming deadline prompted swift action in committee and long afternoons in the chambers throughout the week.\nThe House met for more than four hours Wednesday to clear a slate of 23 bills, and lawmakers passed another 16 off the floor Thursday. Measures on fluoride and workplace conditions proved especially contentious during the proceedings.\nHouse Bill 16 would make water fluoridation programs optional for the governing bodies of local water providers, and lawmakers clashed over the impact of fluoride on both dental and internal health before passing the measure 68-29.\nThe focus then pivoted to differences over occupational safety.\nHouse Bill 398 aims to align Kentucky's workplace safety and health regulations with federal rules. It also calls for limits on Kentucky policies so that they are no more stringent than those on the federal level.\nSupporters said the bill would streamline regulations and make it easier for businesses to locate in Kentucky. However, opponents raised concerns that it would compromise the safety of workers and leave Kentucky subject to uncertainties on the federal level.\nThe bill passed 62-33 and now heads to the Senate.\nFor its part, the upper chamber turned Wednesday to a floor debate over religious liberty and discrimination.\nSenate Bill 60 seeks to reinforce religious liberty protections in Kentucky and clear the way for individuals to sue the government for violations of religious freedom.\nCritics cited concerns that some might use religious protections to justify discrimination. But supporters said the bill is needed to reinforce founding principles and protect religious exercise. The measure cleared the Senate with a 29-7 vote on Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, the spotlight shifted to the Senate Education Committee thanks in part to an appearance by Mitch Barnhart, athletics director at the University of Kentucky, and Josh Heird, director of athletics at the University of Louisville.\nBoth testified in support of Senate Bill 3, which would update Kentucky's name, image and likeness law for college athletes. The proposed changes would align Kentucky's law – adopted in 2022 – with national standards, particularly in the aftermath of the House v. NCAA court case.\nA pending settlement in the case could result in universities providing direct compensation to student athletes, and advocates for the bill said Kentucky needs to respond to the evolving landscape. The committee passed the measure Thursday.\nLater in the day, lawmakers also took action on a priority measure designed to boost Kentucky's growing film industry.\nSenate Bill 1 would establish the Kentucky Film Office to administer the state's film incentive program, help market the state to the film industry and develop workforce training. It received a nod from the Senate Economic Development, Tourism and Labor Committee on Thursday.\nMany other measures are edging closer to passage in the legislature. Here is a look at some of the other bills on the move:\nDyslexia Interventions – House Bill 272 would require local boards of education to develop a policy for identifying and assisting students in kindergarten through third grade who have dyslexia. It also calls on the state Department of Education to collect data and annually review and update its guidance on reading and writing difficulties. The measure cleared the House floor on Tuesday.\nElections Security – House Bill 455 would establish the Office of Election Investigations and Security in the Kentucky Attorney General's Office. The agency would review and investigate alleged violations of state election law. The House advanced the bill Tuesday.\nManufactured Housing – House Bill 160 would prohibit local governments from adopting or enforcing zoning regulations that treat manufactured homes differently from site-built homes in single family residential zones. The manufactured homes would still need to meet strict standards for size, age and foundation. The measure won support from the House on Tuesday.\nMoments of Silence in Schools – Senate Bill 19 would require public schools to hold a moment of silence and reflection for students at the start of the school day. The Senate passed the measure Tuesday.\nKEES Scholarships – Senate Bill 83 would expand the Kentucky Educational Excellence Scholarship program to provide funds for homeschooled students based on their ACT scores. The legislation cleared a Senate floor vote on Tuesday.\nChildhood Hearing Loss – Senate Bill 93 would require all health benefit plans to provide coverage for hearing aids and related services for children with hearing loss. The Senate Health Services Committee voted to advance the bill Wednesday.\nCell Phones in Schools – House Bill 208 calls on school districts to establish a policy for limiting the use of cell phones during the school day with some exceptions for emergencies and instructional purposes. The bill also calls for statewide regulations that would block access to social media sites on school computers. The House Primary and Secondary Education Committee gave the bill a green light Wednesday.\nFinancial Literacy – House Bill 342 would require high school students to earn one credit in a financial literacy course before graduation. The bill received a nod from the House Primary and Secondary Education Committee on Wednesday.\nSchool Bus Cameras – Senate Bill 38 would allow school districts to install camera systems on school buses to help combat stop arm violations. A portion of the fines from violations would be transferred to school districts to help cover the cost of the cameras. The Senate Transportation Committee advanced the legislation Wednesday.\nSquatting – House Bill 10 seeks to crack down on squatting, providing a more concrete procedure for property owners and law enforcement to quickly remove unauthorized occupants from private property. It would also spell out criminal penalties for squatters who damage property. The House Judiciary Committee voted in favor of the bill Wednesday.\nCoercive Control – House Bill 96 would expand domestic abuse laws to include coercive control and allow victims to seek emergency protective orders based on patterns of coercive behaviors. The measure won support from the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.\nInterfering with a Legislative Proceeding – House Bill 399 would create criminal penalties, ranging from a class B misdemeanor to the class D felony, for interfering with a legislative proceeding if the intent is to prevent the general assembly from conducting business. The House Judiciary Committee passed the bill Wednesday.\nStreet Racing – House Bill 465 aims to curb illegal street racing with tougher penalties for offenders. Violations would result in a $1,000 fine for the first offense and a $2,000 fine for subsequent offenses. Violators could also have their car seized, and for a second offense, spend up to 30 days in jail. The House Judiciary Committee advanced the bill Wednesday.\nKindergarten Readiness – House Bill 240 would require schools to administer a reading assessment to kindergarten students within the final 14 days of the academic year. Students who fail to meet grade-level benchmarks and standards would likely need to repeat kindergarten under the proposal. The legislation won support on the House floor Wednesday.\nRepeat DUIs – Under House Bill 220, offenders would face a class D felony charge if caught driving under the influence for a third time. The bill would also create escalating fines for repeat offenses. The House advanced the bill Wednesday.\nFamily Preservation – House Bill 291 seeks to reduce the impact of incarceration on families. When a nonviolent offender serves as a caregiver of a dependent child, the bill would call on judges to consider that role before imposing a sentence for a felony. The House voted in support of the legislation Wednesday.\nSuper Speeders – Senate Bill 57 would levy a new $200 fee against \"super speeders,\" a proposed term for those convicted of driving more than 25 miles per hour over the speed limit on a state highway. Revenue from the legislation would help fund Kentucky's emergency trauma network. The Senate advanced the measure Wednesday.\nYouth Nicotine Use – Senate Bill 100 seeks to curb underage nicotine use by licensing nicotine retailers and providing more oversight of nicotine sales. Retailers operating without a license could face a misdemeanor charge, and possibly a felony for a third offense. The Senate passed the bill Wednesday.\nAntisemitism on Campus – Senate Joint Resolution 55 would direct Kentucky colleges and universities to adopt policies for combating antisemitism. It also calls on campuses to disband and report any student organizations that have provided resources to terrorist organizations. The resolution received support from the Senate on Wednesday.\nDisabilities and Parental Rights – Senate Bill 26 would clarify that disability alone cannot be used as a basis for terminating adoption petitions, terminating parental rights, or determining placement of children. The House Families and Children Committee passed the bill Thursday.\nPersonal Image Rights – Senate Bill 7 would create legal protections to ensure that an image of a person's unclothed body cannot be used for commercial purposes without explicit consent. The Senate Judiciary Committee advanced the legislation Thursday.\nGift Card Scams – Under Senate Bill 130, individuals who tamper with gift cards with the intention to steal funds could face a class D felony charge. The bill received a nod from the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday.\nCounseling Services – Under House Bill 495, mental health services that seek to ease distress related to sex or sexual attraction would be considered protected counseling services. The bill would prevent state agencies and licensing authorities from taking adverse actions against mental health professionals or ordained ministers who provide those services. Supporters argue that the bill is needed to prevent discrimination, but critics say it opens the door to conversion therapy. The House State Government Committee passed the measure Thursday.\nChronic Wasting Disease – House Bill 700 would forbid the exportation of wild deer and elk from a chronic wasting disease surveillance zone. Supporters say the goal is to prevent spread of the fatal prion disease and protect Kentucky's deer and elk population. The House Tourism and Outdoor Recreation Committee voted in support of the bill Thursday.\nMake America Healthy Again – Senate Concurrent Resolution 61 would establish the Make America Healthy Again Kentucky Task Force and charge the group with exploring ways to integrate the principles for the MAHA movement to improve health outcomes in Kentucky. The Senate Families and Children Committee passed the resolution on Tuesday, and the Senate advanced the measure off the floor Thursday.\nReporting Child Abuse – Under Senate Bill 120, school coaches would receive training on the duties and procedures for reporting child abuse. The legislation would also add language to sports participation forms telling parents and students about the right to report abuse and how to make a report. The Senate passed the bill Thursday.\nArtificial Intelligence – Senate Bill 4 would boost oversight and create guidelines for using artificial intelligence in state government and elections. The Senate Committee on State and Local Government gave the bill a nod on Wednesday, and the legislation cleared the Senate on Friday.\nLawmakers are scheduled to reconvene on Tuesday.\nKentuckians can track the action this year through Legislative Record webpage, which allows users to read bills and follow their progression through the chambers.\nCitizens can also share their views on issues with lawmakers by calling the General Assembly's toll-free message line at 1-800-372-7181.\nFRANKFORT — The Senate Education Committee unanimously approved legislation Thursday that would update Kentucky's name, image and likeness law in response to issues that have cropped up since it was first adopted for college athletes.\nName, image, likeness laws – known as NIL – allow student-athletes to generate personal income from their image and celebrity.\nSenate Bill 3, sponsored by Senate Majority Floor Leader Max Wise, R-Campbellsville, seeks to tackle new issues that have emerged in the \"constantly evolving\" NIL landscape. Wise said the legislation would allow Kentucky to remain prepared and competitive in the new era of college sports.\n\"It's a time for us to act, and it's a time for us to update to make sure that the Commonwealth of Kentucky and our universities are not left behind when it comes to college athletics,\" he said.\nSB 3 would align Kentucky's law with national standards, allowing state universities to participate in the emerging revenue sharing model. It would also establish legal protections by providing clear guidelines that ensure fair compensation and protect the student-athletes and the institutions.\nThe bill also includes an emergency provision, meaning it could take effect as soon as the bill becomes law. The urgency will ensure Kentucky's institutions remain competitive as the national landscapes shift, Wise said.\nThe recent House v. NCAA lawsuit has introduced potential changes that could reshape student-athlete compensation, and a proposed $2.5 billion federal settlement is expected to be finalized by April 7. This might allow universities to directly compensate student-athletes, something not previously included in Kentucky's framework, Wise said.\nMitch Barnhart, athletics director at the University of Kentucky, testified that times have changed regarding NIL, and institutions are facing \"choppy waters\" now. He said there are 50 different states that are doing 50 different things, and continuity in laws or rules is important.\nBarnhart was joined by Josh Heird, director of athletics at the University of Louisville, in Thursday's testimony.\n\"A lot of times we compete,\" Barnhart said of Heird. \"But on this, we're on the same team. We both need help as we continue to adjust to the landscape that's in front of us, and the 2022 bill was amazing. It was really, really helpful at a time we desperately needed it.\"\nHeird said he appreciates the proactive approach of the legislators. He offered some details about the settlement.\n\"If approved, the House settlement will assist in creating a framework that provides additional benefits to student-athletes, but also creates guardrails that are much needed in this current environment. The anticipated date for a decision on the House settlement is the first few weeks of April,\" he said.\nHeird said SB 3 would update current state laws so UofL, UK and other schools can implement the presumed changes that will take place if the House settlement is approved.\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald L. Thomas, D-Lexington, said it's clear in his mind that Congress and the NCAA are weak about addressing NIL issues. He also talked about how extremely competitive Kentuckians are sports-wise.\n\"I think it's great that come March, we're going to have both the UK and UofL back in the NCAA tournament, both in the men's and women's tournaments, and that's wonderful for our state,\" he said.\nSen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, said he thinks NIL has \"absolutely destroyed\" college sports, but he can't let Kentucky get behind other states regarding NIL.\n\"You can't focus on the game because all they talk about is that the best player is about to leave to go to another school. I have lost interest in college sport because of it. And it's difficult for me to vote yes for this, and I regret the vote that I made, but in saying that, I also know Kentucky has to compete,\" he said.\nSen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, said he shares Carroll's sentiments.\n\"I wish we could go back, back in the days where the athletes played for the name on the front of the uniform rather than the back. I know we have to do this. I offer my yea vote begrudgingly,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — Chronic wasting disease – or zombie deer disease – poses a threat to Kentucky's deer and elk population and industry, experts say. Rep. Josh Bray, R-Mount Vernon, wants to prevent that from happening.\nBray is the primary sponsor of House Bill 700, which he presented to the House Tourism and Outdoor Recreation Committee on Thursday alongside Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Commissioner Rich Storm.\nThe legislation would place restrictions on the movement of cervids (deer and elk) in chronic wasting disease (CWD) surveillance zones.\nStorm said chronic wasting disease is a 100% incurable and fatal prion disease. The only way to test an animal for the disease is by testing a lymph node from the base of the deer's skull. Bray said the disease cannot be transmitted to humans, but other prion diseases, like mad cow disease, are transmissible to humans.\nKentucky has had two isolated cases of chronic wasting disease, Bray said, but other states haven't been so lucky. In states where the disease has spread, hunting tourism has declined.\n\"My greatest fear – as I sit here today – if we do nothing, and CWD spreads across this state, once it hits interior Kentucky, we will forever wish we had done something today,\" Bray said.\nStorm said Kentucky has a conservation and fiduciary responsibility to preserve Kentucky's cervid population and $2 billion hunting industry. Kentucky also has a thriving deer farming industry.\nUnder HB 700, it would be unlawful to export any wild cervid outside a CWD surveillance zone. Those zones are defined as a 30-mile radius from a positive CWD detection, according to the legislation.\nFor captive cervids, the bill would make it unlawful to export a captive cervid outside a 10-mile radius from a CWD positive captive cervid facility. Cervid facilities who install double fencing could be exempt from some of the regulations in HB 700, Bray said.\nThe bill would allow a CWD surveillance zone designation to expire five years after the zone's last positive CWD case.\nStorm said the legislation would still allow the export of certain cervid products.\n\"They will be able to continue to sell (boneless) meat, the byproducts, the antlers,\" he said.\nSeveral representatives of Kentucky's deer farming industry testified they're already taking precautionary measures when it comes to CWD.\nHenry Woodard, who serves on the Kentucky Alternative Livestock Association board, said deer farming is already heavily regulated by Fish and Wildlife, the Department of Agriculture and the USDA.\n\"We take CWD very seriously,\" he said. \"… We have a CWD response plan already in the state, and it is a response plan by our Department of Ag that we fall under. We test every mortality in our herds for CWD, regardless of proximity to a CWD positive case.\"\nWoodward said HB 700 could shut down many of Kentucky's deer farms.\nSeveral lawmakers had questions about CWD, including how to test for it.\nRep. William Lawrence, R-Maysville, asked about the future of a live test for CWD where farmers and Fish and Wildlife would be able to test a live cervid.\nStorm said he's \"very confident\" there will be a live test in the years to come, but right now there isn't one that's approved.\n\"When the day comes that there's a live test, we can absolutely come back in and change all of this, because it won't be as necessary,\" Bray said.\nLawrence said he understands the urgency behind HB 700, but he worries how the bill may hurt deer farmers.\n\"If I was told I couldn't (operate) for the next five years, it could crush my business,\" Lawrence said, adding he hopes the legislature could communicate the sense of urgency for a live test on a federal level.\nThe House Tourism and Outdoor Recreation Committee approved HB 700 by a 13-1 vote with three pass votes.\nIn explaining his \"yes\" vote, Rep. Adam Moore, D-Lexington, said he's looking forward to using the \"robust\" legislative process to make sure HB 700 is as \"perfect a bill as is possible.\"\nBray said he and Storm have been working with all stakeholders, including the farmers, on the bill and are hoping to find a solution everyone can be content with.\n\"I love deer. I love deer hunting,\" Bray said. \"I would never want to do anything to hurt anybody's business, but there's far too much to lose if we sit here and do nothing.\"\nHB 700 now goes before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — The Kentucky Senate adopted a bill Wednesday that supporters say will strengthen religious liberty in the commonwealth even as some raise concerns about discrimination.\nSenate Bill 60, sponsored by Sen. Steve Rawlings, R-Burlington, advanced off the Senate floor with a 29-7 vote and now heads to the House.\nThe legislation seeks to reenforce religious liberty protections in Kentucky. Specifically, it would waive sovereign and governmental immunity, clearing the way for individuals to sue if the government substantially burdens their religious freedom.\nRawlings said SB 60 would enable religious claimants to get full relief when the government violates their religious liberty, and it would clarify that individuals can invoke the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) in judicial or administrative proceedings.\n\"It ensures that Kentuckians who face a substantial burden on their religious exercise have a fair opportunity to seek justice, including the ability to recover attorney's fees, just as we allow in civil rights cases,\" he said.\nSen. Aaron Reed, R-Shelbyville, spoke in favor of the measure on the Senate floor, arguing that it ensures freedom and would help prevent the government from bullying Kentuckians out of their religious rights.\n\"Our Founding Fathers gave us the constitution not to shield the government from the people, but to protect we the people from an overreaching government,\" he said. \"Today, that overreach too often comes in the form of costly legal battles where the government with its unlimited resources can financially cripple a citizen simply for standing by their faith.\"\nHowever, critics of the bill cited fears over the impact of SB 60 on anti-discrimination efforts.\nSen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, said the legislation could make it difficult for the government to enforce state and local laws that protect people from harm and discrimination, and that lawmakers should make sure everyone receives fairness and justice.\n\"There's a balance that must be struck between protecting religious freedom and ensuring that marginalized communities are not further harmed,\" Herron said. \"No one has the right to harm others, even if those actions are motived by religious beliefs.\"\nRawlings said current state RFRA law already played a crucial role in protecting rights. It was used to reopen churches during COVID-19 and defend the rights of an incarcerated Muslim woman to wear a headscarf in front of male guards, he said.\n\"What Senate Bill 60 does is ensure that when the government oversteps, citizens have the ability to recover legal costs when defending their rights, just as they would in other civil rights cases,\" he said.\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald L. Thomas, D-Lexington, said federal laws prevent discrimination based on race, sex and religion, but do not apply to sexual orientation. He noted that advocates have sought for years to pass a fairness law in Kentucky, which would include sexual orientation among civil rights laws.\nThomas said if a police officer or a government official tried to enforce a fairness ordinance, the person could be personally liable and lose their home, car and bank assets.\n\"It's designed to wipe out all fairness ordinances and expose members of the LGBTQ community again to second class citizenship. Now this is the second time we've done this in this session,\" he said.\nSenate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, voted for the bill, however, saying it offers clarification of definitions, gives citizens appropriate relief and is a safeguard against those who might violate religious liberties of Kentuckians.\n\"I gladly vote yes,\" Mills said.\nFRANKFORT —The Kentucky House of Representatives approved a bill Wednesday that would allow local water districts to remove fluoride from the water supply.\nSponsored by Rep. Mark Hart, R-Falmouth, House Bill 16 does not ban fluoride, but makes it optional.\n\"House Bill 16 removes the unfunded state mandate on water producers that requires fluoride to be added to water after the water is treated and cleaned for consumption,\" Hart said.\nRep. William Lawrence, R-Maysville, is a co-sponsor of the legislation. He has experience working in a wastewater and water treatment facility and spoke on his personal experience with the chemical on the House floor.\n\"Fluoride in water is an unfunded state mandate and forced medication,\" he said. \"... I'm telling you from a personal stance, it's dangerous stuff. I don't allow my children to drink tap water. Their teeth are fine.\"\nLawrence said despite Kentucky mandating water fluoridation, Kentucky is still 48th in the nation when it comes to dental health.\n\"It's not working. We need to do something else,\" he said.\nSeveral other lawmakers, however, said they believe fluoride is beneficial to oral health.\nRep. Adam Moore, D-Lexington, said he would be thinking about children who cannot care for their own teeth when voting \"no\" on HB 16. His mother-in-law, who is a physician, told him children can struggle with sleep apnea, chronic jaw pain and diabetes later in life due to poor dental health.\n\"I very much see the need for local control and decisions like these to be made locally,\" Moore said. \"At the same time, I know that we have an obligation to be looking out for the people who sent us here, especially our children.\"\nRep. Mary Lou Marzian, D-Louisville, said she also foresees Kentuckians, especially children, may have more costly dental health issues if fluoride is removed from the water.\n\"We were all elected by our constituents to be watchdogs of our taxpayers' money, and $1.9 million, which is a low estimate of what this bill could cost Medicaid and our tax payers, is a lot of money,\" she said.\nMarzian filed a floor amendment to require local water districts to reimburse the Department for Medicaid Services for utilization costs of Medicaid-covered dental services. The amendment was not adopted.\nRep. Adrielle Camuel, D-Lexington, joined Moore and Marzian in speaking against allowing fluoride to be optional. She said adding small amounts of fluoride to drinking water for the last 75 years has \"dramatically improved dental health.\"\nShe also said those who do not want to use or consume fluoride, do not have to.\n\"Thanks to science, individuals can utilize a reverse osmosis filter or a distillation filter,\" Camuel said. \"Those filters remove up to 92% of fluoride from tap water.\"\nAnother co-sponsor of HB 16, Rep. Ryan Dotson, R-Winchester, said he is also concerned about fluoride's impact on health, but he agrees with Lawrence. He said he's read research that shows fluoride is a neurotoxin that can reduce IQ, weaken bones and cause thyroid issues, among other health problems.\nDotson also said fluoride can cost local governments up to $600,000 a year, and most of the fluoridated water ends up going down the drain.\n\"We are mass medicating without informed consent or a right to refuse…. It's wasteful, with little to no efficacy at all,\" Dotson said.\nThe House approved HB 16 by a 68-29 vote. The legislation now heads to the Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — The Senate Health Services Committee unanimously advanced a bill Wednesday that would make buying hearing aids for children more affordable through insurance plans in Kentucky.\nSponsored by Sen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, the bill would require all health benefit plans to provide coverage for hearing aids and related services for children with documented hearing loss. It also calls for state regulations that establish a minimum coverage amount of $2,500 per hearing aid.\nOne supporter, Jennifer Hughes, testified that her son was born with hearing loss, and the family faced challenges with inadequate insurance coverage for his hearing aids.\nHughes said her son received his first pair of hearing aids when he was two months old, and there was an immediate difference. When he turned three years old, his audiologist recommended upgrading to a pair that cost $5,000.\n\"Long story short, we paid the full $5,000 for the hearing aids,\" Hughes said. \"Only $2,000 of that went towards our deductible and out-of-pocket. And then the insurance didn't pay anything.\"\nPediatric audiologist Shelley Moats also testified that prior legislation needs to be updated to meet today's situations. She said a law passed in 2002 required insurance plans to cover the devices for children, but it has not kept pace with the changes in the health care environment, specifically when it comes to high-deductible insurance plans.\n\"Most parents end up being completely out-of-pocket on the purchase of hearing aids for their child,\" she said, adding that of the roughly 58,000 babies born in Kentucky in 2023, about 175 had permanent hearing loss.\nSen. Craig Richardson, R-Hopkinsville, asked if the price for hearing aids is associated with the size and development of children.\nMoats said children are typically fit with hearing aids that go behind the ear and have a life expectancy of about five years as children sweat and get dirty. That creates a replacement cost over time, she said.\nBerg said the original version of the bill included coverage requirements for adults as well, but she removed those provisions in the current version. She also expressed concern about a lack of pediatric audiologists in Kentucky networks.\nSenate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, asked about a fiscal note, and Berg said it was for the original bill.\n\"We have requested a second fiscal note. We've not gotten that back, but the assumption is it's going to be less than the current because we excluded adults, and the original fiscal bill included those people,\" she said.\nMills asked about breakage, loss and maintenance of hearing aids.\nMoats said manufacturers understand that hearing aids for children are at risk of loss or breakage, and the cost includes unlimited repair and a one-time replacement for loss or damage during the warranty period.\nThe bill now heads to the full Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — Criminal penalties for unlawful street racing in Kentucky would increase under a new House bill.\nThe House Judiciary Committee approved House Bill 465 on Wednesday. Rep. Beverly Chester-Burton, D-Shively, and House Majority Whip Jason Nemes, R-Middletown, are the primary sponsors of the legislation.\nChester-Burton, who represents part of Jefferson County, said the bill was modeled after Louisville Metro Council's efforts to curb street racing.\n\"House Bill 465 is presented today as an effort to address the issue of street racing where it's been significantly affecting my area in Jefferson County,\" she said. \"However, I have had other members throughout the community who have contacted me about street racing.\"\nThe current penalty for street racing in Kentucky is a $200 fine. Under HB 465, the fine would increase to $1,000 on the first offense, and violators could face a $2,000 fine on the second or subsequent offense, Chester-Burton said.\nViolators could have the vehicle used in the act impounded on a first offense as well. For a second or subsequent offense, violators could spend up to 30 days in jail and have the vehicle seized for crushing or auction. The revenue would go to the Crime Victims Compensation Board, she added.\nNemes said the penalty increase is needed to hopefully deter street racing across the commonwealth.\n\"These are people who are deliberately putting citizens' lives in danger,\" Nemes said. \"They know they're doing it, so the first time we're only going to fine them $1,000. I think it should be much higher than that, but that's what we've put as the first offense.\"\nNemes said street racing is getting \"out of control\" in Jefferson County.\nMetro Councilwoman Donna Purvis testified in support of HB 465. She said illegal street racing often involves violence.\n\"I am sure this is not just a Louisville problem, and for that reason, a message should be sent to the entire state there will be serious consequences for the endangerment of other's lives,\" Purvis said.\nRecreational, permitted street racing is a new activity in the commonwealth. Rep. John Blanton, R-Salyersville, asked Chester-Burton and Nemes if HB 465 could inadvertently ban the activity.\n\"I'm supportive of the bill, but I want to make sure we don't inadvertently prevent the tourism aspect that's going on in southeast Kentucky where we're doing permitted road racing there,\" Blanton said.\nCommittee chair Daniel Elliott, R-Danville, said there is a provision in HB 465 that keeps the recreational road racing exempt. Nemes confirmed the legislation only impacts illegal activities.\nThe House Judiciary Committee approved HB 465 by a 15-0 vote with one member passing.\nRep. T.J. Roberts, R-Burlington, decided to vote pass due to constitutionality concerns over the seizure provision in the bill.\n\"I do have constitutional concerns, and I would like to research this further,\" he said, citing a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment.\nIn voting \"yes,\" Rep. Mary Lou Marzian, D-Louisville, thanked Chester-Burton and Nemes for bringing HB 465.\n\"It is so important,\" she said. \"It's heartbreaking to see what happens — the devastation and the deaths of people — it's going to be all over the state before we know it.\"\nHB 465 will now go before the full House for its consideration\nFRANKFORT — Kentucky has a housing shortage. House Bill 160 could help, according to supporters.\nSponsored by Rep. Susan Witten, R-Louisville, HB 160 would ensure qualified manufactured homes that meet strict standards for size, age and permanent foundation are treated the same as site-built homes in single family residential zones.\nThe bill is the result of the work done by the Kentucky Housing Task Force in which Witten served as a co-chair. The goal of last year's task force was to study and review the current and future policy needs of the state to address access and availability of housing to the citizens of the commonwealth.\nWitten said the task force determined the state needs around 200,000 housing units.\n\"These gaps hit all 120 counties. They affect urban, rural and suburban communities, and the shortages are across all price points,\" Witten said. \"It was clear from the testimony that the demand for housing has far outpaced the production of new supply in Kentucky.\"\nManufactured homes could be one of the housing gap solutions, Witten added.\nWitten said local governments would still retain control over cosmetic standards, square footage requirements, setbacks and lot orientation under HB 160. Additionally, the bill would not allow mobile homes, trailers or traditional manufactured homes where they're currently prohibited.\n\"It does not impact HOA rules, deed or developer restrictions, or historical preservation areas,\" Witten added.\nTo address concerns some stakeholders have with the bill, Witten said she worked with Rep. Patrick Flannery, R-Olive Hill, on a floor amendment that further clarifies local government authority.\nFlannery said the amendment confirms local governments can protect property values, restores the right to regulate square footage, adds language to regulate setbacks and lot orientation and addresses some concerns about certain shapes and sizes.\nAdditionally, the floor amendment changes the dates of qualified manufactured homes to a rolling five-year period and addresses foundation requirement concerns, Flannery said.\n\"This amendment is the product of good faith negotiations between local government organizations like the (Kentucky Association of Counties) and the (Kentucky League of Cities), and attempts to incorporate some of their suggestions and alleviate some of the concerns and heartburn that they had about this bill as it passed committee,\" Flannery said.\nThe amendment was adopted, and the Kentucky House of Representatives passed HB 160 by a 90-5 vote.\n\"If we truly want to prioritize home ownership for working class Kentuckians, while at the same time addressing our housing shortage, ensuring that qualified manufactured homes are treated equally to cycled homes is an important step,\" Witten said.\nIn explaining her \"yes\" vote, Rep. Sarah Stalker, D-Louisville, thanked Witten for her work on the bill and the Kentucky Housing Task Force.\nHB 160 now heads to the Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — The Senate Families and Children Committee adopted a resolution Tuesday to explore strategies for better using the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Employment and Training program in Kentucky.\nSenate Resolution 18 calls for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services to compile a report detailing findings, strategies and recommendations for expanding SNAP E&T utilization and submit a report to the general assembly by Dec. 1.\nSponsored by Senate Democratic Floor Leader Gerald A. Neal, D-Louisville, the resolution was adopted with an 8-0 vote. One legislator cast a pass vote.\n\"SNAP E&T is a powerful tool for Kentucky and businesses alike. It helps individuals receiving SNAP benefits to gain valuable job training education and workforce development opportunities while strengthening our state's labor market by fully leveraging federal funding,\" Neal testified. \"We can expand access to training and employment services at no additional cost to the commonwealth.\"\nNeal said Kentucky and other states face workforce participation challenges – mainly in rural and underserved areas. The program provides critical services such as job search assistance, vocational training and support for employment barriers such as transportation and child care.\n\"By expanding our engagement with this program, we can help more individuals transition from public assistance into stable, higher paying jobs and reducing poverty rates and foster economic growth,\" he said.\nJessica Klein, of the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, testified that all states are required to operate a SNAP E&T program, and it's up to the states to determine how they will operate.\n\"Kentucky's program helps provide supports to SNAP participants between 16 and 59, and that's a group we call work registrants in the SNAP program,\" she said.\nThe voluntary program is operated by five key partners across Kentucky, and with additional engagement and the possibility of adding more partners, the program could expand, Klein said.\nSen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, suggested Amazon as a potential partner, noting that the corporation just celebrated a workforce program graduation.\n\"So maybe that is an organization and entity that you all can talk to and partner with to figure out how we do make this work here in Kentucky,\" she said.\nSen. Shelley Funke Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, asked if the workforce opportunities in the program are taking away dollars from other existing programs.\nCHFS Secretary Eric Friedlander said there are several different elements of the SNAP program, and one doesn't take away from the other. He said it's a supportive piece.\nSenate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, said the state needs workforce training, but said he's concerned the legislature might have to authorize spending.\n\"I'm concerned slightly about the wording here where it says 'implement strategies to maximize utilization' because I think the administration has used those types of terms on drawdown of Medicaid dollars that have expanded Medicaid,\" he said.\nSen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, asked if there should be a fiscal note with the resolution, and Committee Chair Sen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, said the matter at hand is a simple resolution.\nMeredith cast a pass vote.\nWhen Herron cast her vote, she recognized the other legislators' concerns about possible funding.\n\"I want my colleagues to just know, I know there has been a little concern about what potential costs, if anything, but just remember whatever the cost is, it's for workforce. So, if we're putting anything in, the goal is that these individuals would have employment, higher education so that they then would not be utilizing the SNAP benefits program,\" she said.\nThe resolution now heads to the full Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A bill seeking to curb issues in the planning and zoning process at the local level advanced from the House Local Government Committee on Tuesday.\nRep. John Hodgson, R-Fisherville, is the primary sponsor of House Bill 18. He told the committee the bill would require local elected officials to have a say on new developments in single-family zoned areas instead of leaving the decision solely up to unelected planning and zoning boards.\nHodgson said multi-family dwellings and other developments are causing infrastructure issues, such as unsafe traffic congestion, in certain communities across Kentucky.\n\"Some suburban areas are seeing attempts to insert high-density apartments and development into these single-family areas, straining the infrastructure to the breaking point and fundamentally changing the quiet character of the existing neighborhoods forever,\" he said.\nUnder HB 18, any density development project proposed in a traditional single-family home zone would be treated as if it were an amendment to the zoning map and would be required to be approved by the local fiscal court or legislative body.\nAdditionally, the legislation would create some development incentives for infill development in urban areas, Hodgson said. Another provision also provides a two-year extension on a moratorium on zoning district classification changes.\nRep. Sarah Stalker, D-Louisville, said she is concerned certain provisions of HB 18, like the moratorium extension, may make the housing crisis in Kentucky worse.\n\"I think density is the key, and this concerns me that we are restricting local communities … This seems to go against a whole other effort that we're up against in this state. Is there something else that I'm missing?\" Stalker said.\nHodgson said he agrees there are areas that need density, but making sure the infrastructure to support it is crucial. There are highways in the state where emergency vehicles cannot safely pass through due to high traffic caused by high-density development, he said.\n\"(House Bill 18) doesn't stop you from doing density development. You just have to have weigh-in and a vote by the elected officials,\" Hodgson added.\nLiam Gallagher, legislative director for Americans for Prosperity Kentucky, testified against the legislation to the committee. He spoke against a provision of the bill that would limit new leases of certain properties in single-family home zones and said the measure would hurt housing development and limit property rights.\nRep. Ken Fleming, R-Louisville, also said he has concerns about HB 18, but he agrees there are planning and zoning issues that need to be addressed.\n\"I am concerned from a development standpoint and want to make sure that there are incentives to provide housing and so forth,\" Fleming said, adding he appreciates the effort but needs to clarify some things before moving forward.\nFleming recorded a \"pass\" vote on the bill.\nEchoing Hodgson's earlier comments, Rep. Jared Bauman, R-Louisville, said there are three major developments planned for a road in his district that cannot support the traffic.\n\"I'm thinking that my constituents support this very much because you are going to strengthen their position to push back against these developments that end with three-story apartments overlooking homes that have been in that neighborhood for 60 to 80 years,\" Bauman said, encouraging the committee to vote \"yes\" on HB 18.\nThe House Local Government Committee voted 14 to 4 with two pass votes to send HB 18 to the House floor.\nFRANKFORT — A bill currently on the move in the Kentucky House of Representatives seeks to reduce incarceration rates and keep families together.\nRep. Nick Wilson, R-Williamsburg, and other stakeholders testified on House Bill 291 before the House Families and Children Committee on Thursday. Wilson is the primary sponsor of the legislation and the committee's vice-chair.\nHB 291, also known as the Family Preservation and Accountability Act, would ask judges to consider a defendant's status as a caretaker of a dependent child before imposing a sentence for a felony offense.\n\"The Family Preservation and Accountability Act addresses challenges by expanding sentencing alternatives for primary caregivers convicted of nonviolent offenses,\" Wilson said.\nThe legislation would not apply to defendants convicted of a violent offense or defendants who used or attempted to use physical force while committing the crime. If the victim is a child or statute prohibits alternative sentencing, HB 291 would also not apply.\n\"The intent of the bill is to prioritize family unity, reduce harm from the separation of parents and children, and offer a rehabilitative approach that preserves that parent-child relationship while safeguarding child safety, safety of the community, while taking all of those things into consideration,\" Wilson said.\nWilson said the bill would allow defendants at the time of conviction to file a motion asking the judge to consider their status as a primary caregiver. The judge would then determine whether the defendant is a primary caregiver. If true, then the judge can use that information during sentencing.\nThe bill would allow the court to require a defendant participate in a substance use disorder treatment program, parenting classes, anger management, job training, literacy classes and more in addition to the imposed sentence, Wilson said.\nSarah Durand, vice president of government affairs for Kentucky Free, testified alongside Wilson. She said HB 291 would save the state $74 million in direct incarceration costs.\n\"That is just savings of housing incarcerating primary caregivers,\" Durand said. \"However, national research indicates that for every dollar spent on incarceration, society loses an additional $10 in indirect costs. As we looked at this and looked at those indirect costs, this bill has the ability to add $740 million annually to the state's economy.\"\nCortney Downs with Kentucky Youth Advocates said parental incarceration is an adverse childhood experience, which is a traumatic event occurring in childhood that is often associated with negative long-term outcomes.\nNearly 102,000 children in Kentucky will experience parental incarceration, she added.\n\"The persistently high rates of kids who are affected by parental incarcerations creates an urgency for us to minimize the impact,\" Downs said, adding HB 291 will help children.\nKenton County Circuit Court Judge Patricia Summe said there are \"a lot of good things\" about HB 291, but she has concerns about some of the language in the bill and how a ruling may impact a family court case.\n\"Our biggest concern is about the overlap and the crossing of making decisions about whether or not somebody is a caregiver, not a parent, but a caregiver, and how much that involves.\"\nWilson said the judges have a valid point about not wanting to \"step on family court's toes.\"\n\"We added a section that the determination that's being made under this bill is not admissible as evidence in family court,\" he said, adding he's willing to continue working on the legislation's language.\nRep. Kimberly Poore Moser, R-Taylor Mill, said she supports the legislation, but would support more changes.\n\"I'm in support of this. I just want to find a way that really helps streamline the information that the judges need to make these determinations,\" Moser said.\nThe House Families and Children Committee unanimously approved HB 291. It will now go before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — The Senate Education Committee on Thursday unanimously advanced Senate Bill 19, which would require public schools to establish procedures for moments of silence and reflection in the classroom.\nThe bill's sponsor, Sen. Rick Girdler, R-Somerset, testified that the measure would allow students to have a moment of silence at the start of the school day without any religious connotations.\nTestifying with Girdler was Rabbi Shlomo Litvin, who is involved with several Jewish organizations and is director of Central Kentucky's branch of Chabad-Lubavitch.\nLitvin said he strongly endorses SB 19 because a moment of silence has long been recognized as a valued practice in schools to offer students an opportunity for reflection, mindfulness and focus. He said under the measure, teachers wouldn't be allowed to tell the students how to use the time.\n\"It fosters an important sense of self-worth among students and strengthens their respect for one another. As we explore meaningful ways to uplift and support our students, a brief 60-120 seconds of silence, of silent reflection, is a simple yet powerful tool that can make a real difference,\" he said.\nResearch consistently demonstrates that such moments enhance cognitive abilities, concentration, and emotional well-being, Litvin said. He added that they also contribute to a more respectful and thoughtful school environment.\n\"Importantly, Senate Bill 19 does not infringe on religious freedom. It is crafted by Jewish leaders here in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and has been endorsed by rabbis from across the state as well as religious leaders from a diverse range of faith groups and secular mental health professionals, he said.\nRabbi Ben Freed of Keneseth Israel Congregation of Louisville, said some points of the bill are \"wonderful,\" but cited concerns with changing the law to require moments of silence.\nThe possibility that The Lord's Prayer could be recited before the moments of silence is also a concern, Freed said.\n\"And I feel that mandating it goes, to me, a step too far especially in conjunction with the fact that earlier in this statute, the statute states that it is permissible to have a recitation of the Lord's Prayer… I find that to be somewhat problematic for a Jewish kid who would be in a classroom,\" he said.\nMindy Haas, executive director of The Jewish Federation of the Bluegrass, said the federation agrees with Freed, and there are rabbis in Lexington who do not support the bill.\nSen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, asked the speakers if moments of silence are already being observed in public schools. Girdler and Litvin said they aren't aware of this happening.\nTichenor said the measure would offer children a chance to take a deep breath and have some silence. She also said the United States has a deep history of Christianity, and teaching this as a historical fact can be valuable to students.\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald L. Thomas, D-Lexington, said he takes his faith very seriously, and as he reads the bill, there's nothing to prohibit a Jewish, Muslim or Christian student from using the moment of silence to think about religion in the context of which they've been trained.\nThomas said religion can be used in two ways – either as a sword or as a shield.\n\"And when I see statutes where religion is being the sword to promote bigotry or discrimination or hate, then I'm going to oppose. I'm going to oppose those bills, because there's no place in American for a religion to be used in that context,\" he said. \"But where religion is being as a shield, to provide comfort, or consolation or just a moment of peace for a person, then I'm going to allow that, and that's what this bill does.\"\nThe bill now heads to the full Senate.\nFRANKFORT — A bill to expand and improve services for justice-involved, high-acuity youth received unanimous endorsement Wednesday from the Kentucky Senate. The legislation is part of a multi-year effort to reform juvenile justice in the commonwealth.\nSen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, testified that the bill he's sponsoring – Senate Bill 111 – stems from a working group dedicated to the complicated issue.\n\"Senate Bill 111 is another product of the DJJ working group established by leadership in both chambers two years ago. The bill is also very much a collaborative effort with the Justice Cabinet, the Department of Juvenile Justice, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, the Administrative Office of the Courts, and the Kentucky Hospital Association,\" he said.\nCarroll said the bill would create a protocol for determining the proper location to provide mental health treatment to youths. It would also establish enhanced rates for inpatient psychiatric hospitals and pediatric teaching hospitals caring for youths.\nIn addition, SB 111 would create a process to remove youths who commit acts of violence or incite violence at a treatment facility, and it would create a process to move youths to a lower level of care if a physician determines that the current level is no longer required.\nThe bill also calls for the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet to construct a specialized mental health facility to provide residential treatment for high-acuity youth in the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice.\nThe Cabinet for Health and Family Services would need to contract with a public teaching university to provide clinical services to the facility.\nSB 111 also contains language addressing confidentially of juvenile records and other provisions, Carroll said.\nThe original bill included provisions to construct two female juvenile detention facilities, but that language was removed from the bill through a floor amendment Wednesday.\nCarroll said the facilities are still being planned, but the current legislative session is a non-budget year. He expects the facilities could be broached again during the 2026 legislative session.\nCurrently, females are housed in a single facility, and there are times when it has been at capacity. Counties are often transporting females across the state, he said.\n\"We do plan to move forward with that. But there is, right now, a $90 million price tag on these two facilities, and we will continue to work in that direction,\" he said.\nSen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, thanked Carroll and said she wants to help solve juvenile justice related challenges. She expressed concern about a high turnover rate of juvenile justice commissioners and other cases of instability, which can have a negative effect on the youth.\nHerron said she has spent several years working with justice-involved youth who are in the foster care system, and that they respond to their environment.\n\"I think we have a huge responsibility to continue to analyze, review and look at, from the top to bottom, the needs of our kids who are justice-involved. And it's not just the kids who are in facilities, but it's also the kids who are in communities, the kids when they're coming home to re-entry,\" she said.\nSen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, said she has heard from constituents about juvenile justice issues.\n\"I stand to thank the people who have been working on this bill. This is an issue that I've had constituents come to me about,\" she said. \"This is an issue in our state that is of high significance, and I really want to say that this is something I think we're moving forward with and thank you.\"\nFRANKFORT — A measure to set aside funding for nuclear energy development grants in Kentucky was unanimously given the green light by the Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee on Wednesday.\nSen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, testified that the bill he's sponsoring – Senate Bill 179 – will bolster the Kentucky Nuclear Energy Development Authority (KNEDA). Lawmakers established the group last year to promote the development of nuclear energy and a related ecosystem within Kentucky.\n\"This bill establishes the nuclear energy grant program within KNEDA. As you all will remember, we appropriated $40 million that went to the University of Kentucky to support the nuclear authority and also EPIC (Energy Planning and Inventory Commission). The provision was that those boards would be operated with the interest from the $40 million investment that we made,\" he said.\nThe measure calls for setting aside $10 million of the $40 million for grants, and it sets up a subcommittee of board members to oversee the process for evaluating applications and awarding funds.\nThe maximum grant an entity could receive would be $2 million. But over time, more funding could be earmarked for the effort, Carroll said. He pointed to nuclear development in Tennessee, and said Kentucky can't lag behind other states.\nTennessee has invested about $95 million in such efforts, \"and as a result, Tennessee has taken the lead in this country on the development. The first small scale reactor, SMR (small modular reactors), will be built in Tennessee, and they are getting numerous businesses, development coming in related to nuclear,\" he said.\nSen. Stephen West, R-Paris, thanked Carroll for his work on the initiative.\n\"This is important now. We needed this yesterday. Just look forward to working on this with you in the future,\" he said.\nCarroll said he and West continue to learn more about nuclear energy, and \"these are historical times, and Kentucky has got to step up in this area or we've going to be left behind.\"\nSenate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, said he agrees with West that moving forward is necessary.\n\"All of us on this committee are concerned about energy, and we've got to put our head down and get to work and get back to being a leader in energy in the nation,\" he said.\nCommittee Chair Sen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, encouraged committee members to study energy-related bills that are moving through the committee.\n\"Let's take the time to do the due diligence so they can move through our committee quickly. It is going to be very pivotal for us to take advantage of having a president that has a power policy,\" he said.\nSmith said now is a transitional time for American energy, and the United States needs to be at the forefront of energy and artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\"And we don't want to wind up being energy poor,\" he said. \"We've seen what that does to other nations. That does not need to happen to us, so I do really applaud the effort here.\"\nThe bill now heads to the Senate.\nFRANKFORT — Seven years ago, a gunman killed 17 people at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, including 14-year-old Alyssa Alhadeff.\nAlyssa's mother Lori Alhadeff joined Rep. Kevin Jackson, R-Bowling Green, Rep. Chad Aull, D-Lexington, and a group of Kentucky students to testify on House Bill 14 during the House Primary and Secondary Education Committee meeting on Wednesday.\nHB 14, also known as Alyssa's Law, would allow Kentucky public schools to implement a wearable panic alert system for teachers, administrators and other school staff. Jackson and Aull are co-sponsors of the legislation.\n\"The principle of Alyssa's Law is simple: Time equals life. And we need to get our kids and teachers to safety quickly and reduce the response time of first responders,\" Alhadeff said.\nThe bill defines a wearable panic alert system as a silent security system. It is a manually activated device that sends a nonaudible signal to the local 911 call center and emergency responder agencies.\nJackson said HB 14 would make Kentucky schools safer.\n\"Seconds matter in an emergency,\" he said. \"This is not only for an active shooter … I've got four little grandkids. That would be our worst nightmare, but it can be used for medical emergencies, fights, etc.\"\nJackson showed an example of the device to the committee. He said its about the same size as the ID badges teachers already wear every day. After the button is pressed three times, the device vibrates and alerts first responders to the exact location of the emergency.\nAull said HB 14 does not currently fund the purchase of the system, but establishes the framework for funding in the biennial budget next year.\n\"The entire cost on the high end would be $6 million and on the low end, it would be about $2 million,\" Aull added. \"And the draft here is a 50/50 match, so the local school district would have some skin in the game as well as the general assembly.\"\nRep. Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, who is also a teacher, said Jefferson County Public Schools is already in the process of rolling out a similar device.\n\"I believe that we have a different vendor than the one for the sample device,\" she said. \"If there are any limitations that are brought through this legislation that would keep you from having another vendor, would you be supportive in making sure multiple vendors (can be used)?\"\nJackson and Aull said HB 14 is \"vendor neutral.\"\nInstallation isn't the only cost school districts would have to consider. Aull said there are ongoing maintenance fees of up to $7,000 to $8,000 per campus.\nRep. Felicia Rabourn, R-Turners Station, asked if the proposed grant system in the bill would help with any ongoing costs. Under HB 14, The Center for School Safety would have the ability to establish the Wearable Panic Alert Grant Program.\nAull said the bill is written to incentivize installation.\n\"If the general assembly decides to put more money in the fund, then there will be plenty of opportunity for leftover dollars then to go pay for ongoing maintenance as well,\" Aull said.\nAs for training, Rep. Ken Fleming, R-Louisville, asked who would be responsible for training teachers and other staff on how to use and maintain the devices and deploy them in the correct situation.\n\"I want to make sure that that's harped on and emphasized in order to make sure that the proper protocol is trained for teachers, staff and so forth,\" Fleming said.\nAull said the bill requires that all building personnel receive training on the protocol and the appropriate use of the system.\n\"That training would be led in conjunction with the school district and the vendor to provide that training on what they have installed in the school system,\" Aull added.\nAlyssa's Law unanimously advanced from the committee and now heads to the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — Cigar enthusiasts may soon have more places around the commonwealth to sample and enjoy cigars.\nHouse Bill 211, sponsored by Rep. Chris Lewis, R-Louisville, would create a regulatory framework for cigar bars and prevent local anti-smoking ordinances from prohibiting their operation.\nLewis opened his speech on the House floor on Tuesday by telling the Kentucky House of Representatives what House Bill 211 does not do.\n\"This bill does not fully roll back existing smoke-free laws in any local municipality in the commonwealth,\" he said. \"This is not about smoking cigars in a regular bar, your local bowling alley, a restaurant, or in any other public place that doesn't currently allow smoking if you do not want to be exposed to cigar smoke in a public place where smoke free laws currently exist.\n\"Nothing in this bill changes your ability to maintain that separation.\"\nLewis said HB 211 would create a \"very narrow exemption\" to allow smoking of cigars inside cigar bars.\nHB 211 defines cigar bars as a 21 and older establishment that holds a valid quota retail drink license and generates at least 15% of its annual gross income from the on-site sale of cigars, pipe tobacco, paraphernalia, and accessories.\nLewis said the legislation would give local governments oversight of the businesses.\n\"It also adds another layer of government inspections and accountability to the process,\" Lewis said. \"A local government may enact an ordinance requiring a cigar bar to obtain an annual permit for its inspection for its operation to ensure that the applicant complies with the requirements set forth in this legislation.\"\nHB 211 would also require cigar bars that share a physical wall or common enclosed air space with any other structure to implement smoke mitigation measures. A smoke-free area for delivery drivers or mail carriers would also be required in some circumstances, Lewis said.\nHouse Floor Amendment 2, filed by Lewis, would exempt currently operating cigar bars from being required from having a smoke-free delivery area.\n\"This will prevent those businesses currently in operation from incurring unreasonable expenses to establish such a space as a result of this legislation,\" Lewis said.\nRep. Anne Gay Donworth, D-Lexington, spoke against the amendment.\n\"I don't think it's acceptable to require someone who is doing the course of their job, their delivery job, to be required to inhale secondhand smoke,\" she said.\nDonworth and Rep. George Brown Jr., D-Lexington, said cigar bar regulation should be left up to local governments.\n\"I think this bill overrides local control, so I'm vehemently opposed to this piece of legislation,\" Brown said.\nHB 211 cosponsor Rep. Jim Gooch Jr., R-Providence, said only six or seven cigar bars would be impacted by House Floor Amendment 2, and those delivery drivers typically enter through a well-ventilated part of the business.\n\"I think it's a very reasonable bill, and it certainly does not change any of the existing restaurant laws or bar laws that are on the books now,\" Gooch said. \"With that, I urge people to vote for this amendment and for the bill.\"\nHouse Floor Amendment 2 was adopted by a voice vote.\nThe House also adopted House Floor Amendment 1 by a voice vote. Rep. Steven Doan, R-Erlanger, filed the amendment.\n\"This is a simple floor amendment that would allow a local government to opt out of the liquor license requirement,\" Doan said. This floor amendment would be helpful for dry counties, he added.\nHB 211 advanced off the House floor by a 74-19 vote. It now goes before the Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A measure to combat youth nicotine use in Kentucky – Senate Bill 100 – advanced unanimously Tuesday during a meeting of the Senate Licensing and Occupations Committee.\nThe legislation seeks to stop the supply of tobacco products to underaged children. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, said most retailers follow the law, but action is needed to address \"bad actors.\"\n\"In my 42 years as a retailer, I firmly believe the only way to control the bad actors in this industry is by licensing all retailers of vape, tobacco and alternative nicotine products. This bill takes a strong step in that direction,\" he said.\nThe legislation would establish the Division of Tobacco, Nicotine and Vapor Products Licensing within the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. The division would be managed by a director who will enforce regulations on the sale and distribution of tobacco, nicotine and vapor products, Higdon said.\nAdditionally, administrative regulations would be created to govern the products, and investigators would have the authority to inspect any premises where tobacco, nicotine or vapor products are manufactured, stored or sold. Investigators would also have the power to confiscate contraband, he said.\nThe legislation calls for a $250 license and $50 application fee to be obtained before selling the products in Kentucky. If fines and penalties are not paid, the retailer cannot renew a license.\nRetailers operating without a license would face a Class B misdemeanor for the first offense, a Class A misdemeanor for the second offense, and for third and subsequent offenses, a Class D felony.\nRetailers would have access to an appeals process, and 50% of the collected fines would go to enforcement. The remaining funds would support youth education programs on the dangers of nicotine, vaping and tobacco, Higdon testified.\n\"This bill has teeth. If you sell products without a license, you will face criminal penalties,\" he said.\nGriffin Nemeth, a student at the University of Kentucky, leads the #iCANendthetrend Youth Advisory Board. He thanked Higdon for the legislation and testified during the meeting.\nNemeth said Kentucky is approximately one of 10 states where retailers are not required to have licenses to sell tobacco products, and the legislation includes strong, enforceable penalties.\n\"Nicotine dependence and the accessibility of these products pose a real threat to Kentucky kids – not just to their health, not just to their education, but to their futures as a whole,\" he said.\nDelaney Crump, also with #iCANendthetrend and a student at Boyd County High School, said vaping is an academic distraction and leads to under performance. Many students can't resist the vapes that are sometimes sweet and fruity.\n\"The consequences of inaction are devastating. This isn't just about lung cancer 30 years down the line, it's about kids dropping out of sports because their lungs can't keep up. It's about the anxiety and depression that nicotine fuels,\" she said.\nSen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, R-Lexington, said that as a mom of teenagers, she is well aware of the issue of vaping in elementary, middle or high school. She said lawmakers have in recent years discussed the importance of holding people accountable.\nSen. Jason Howell, R-Murray, said prevention programs are paramount. He asked Crump where she thinks her peers obtain the vapes.\nShe said adults sometimes buy them for the students. She also hears students talking about the places where they get them.\nSen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville, said vapes can look like flash drives and they're easy for young people to conceal. She said she's concerned about life-long impacts the products can cause.\n\"The thing that concerns me is the testimony about these companies that intentionally design these to appeal to our young people – to make the candy flavors and the bright colors,\" she said.\nSen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, said the bill is important for young people's health.\n\"I don't know if people out there understand nicotine is as addictive as opioids are. It is extremely addicting, and I know growing up in Kentucky, that I was able to purchase cigarettes by the time I was 12 years old without any difficulty whatsoever,\" she said.\nThe bill now heads to the full Senate.\nFRANKFORT — A bill that would regulate automated license plate reader data and other electronic tracking measures is on the move.\nRep. John Hodgson, R-Fisherville, is the primary sponsor of House Bill 20. The same bill advanced from the House unanimously last year but stalled in the Senate, he told the House Transportation Committee on Tuesday.\nUnder HB 20, any entity maintaining or deploying automated license plate readers would be required to delete the collected data within 60 days, unless it is being used as evidence in an investigation or for toll collection. The bill would also prohibit the sale of the data.\nAdditionally, HB 20 would protect Kentuckians from being required, coerced or compelled to be \"microchipped\" or administered a subcutaneous device.\nThe legislation also seeks to protect Kentuckians from unlawful surveillance via a tracking device on a person or property. There would be exceptions. Law enforcement would not be prevented from lawfully using tracking devices, for example.\n\"Basically, we're trying to avoid the non-consensual tracking of the movements of American citizens,\" Hodgson said.\nDuring discussion, Rep. Anne Gay Donworth, D-Lexington, asked Hodgson, \"Who will be responsible for making sure that the information is deleted after 60 days?\"\nHodgson said law enforcement entities, who are typically the ones managing automated license plate readers, would be responsible.\n\"We rely on the goodwill of the vendors who have that policy in place now, but this would make it illegal to do that,\" Hodgson added.\nRep. Matthew Lehman, D-Newport, said he noticed the bill allows victims of violations to take civil action, but he suggested considering adding criminal penalties in the future.\n\"I'm very supportive of the bill. But if there's multiple victims involved or a bad actor, I think maybe also amending the criminal code would be helpful,\" Lehman said.\nRep. Samara Heavrin, R-Leitchfield, said she hopes HB 20 paves the way for highway safety camera legislation.\nThe House Transportation Committee unanimously approved HB 20. It now heads to the full House for consideration.\nLawmakers ramp up the pace as dozens of bills sail through committees\nFRANKFORT — The Old State Capitol was full of spirit this week as lawmakers gaveled in to session under the painted gaze of Isaac Shelby and George Washington and advanced a pair of bills that would designate every June as Kentucky History Month.\nHouse Bill 313 and Senate Bill 313 are companion measures that each received a nod Tuesday in the Old Capitol building, which served as the home of the Kentucky General Assembly from 1830 to 1910.\nLawmakers conduct a session day in the Old Capitol every few years in a nod to legislative tradition, and this year's event seems like it happened a century ago given the expansive schedule that unfolded throughout the rest of the week.\nOver a packed four days, bills on smoking, insurance fraud, tax exemptions, and driver safety all received action. Lawmakers discussed the legal theories behind Chevron deference and debated a proposal to display the Ten Commandments on the Capitol grounds.\nDeliberations were especially pointed Thursday when the Senate Judiciary Committee took up Senate Bill 2, which would prohibit public funds from being spent on procedures, treatments and surgeries related to gender transition in Kentucky prisons.\nLawmakers sparred over the nature of the procedures – whether they are elective or constitute necessary medical treatment. Ultimately, the bill cleared the committee with a 6-2 vote and now heads to the full chamber. One member voted \"pass.\"\nLawmakers were more unified when the House Judiciary Committee green-lighted a bill related to wrongful convictions.\nUnder House Bill 206, wrongfully convicted individuals who prove their innocence could petition to receive financial compensation based on the amount of time they spent imprisoned, on parole or under supervision. The bill won committee support with a 19-0 vote on Wednesday.\nLike many weeks in the general assembly, education issues also loomed large on the agenda.\nThe House Primary and Secondary Education Committee advanced a measure Wednesday to strengthen dyslexia interventions in public schools.\nHouse Bill 272 would require local boards of education to develop a policy for identifying and assisting students in kindergarten through third grade who have dyslexia. It also calls on the state Department of Education to collect data and annually review and update its guidance on reading and writing difficulties.\nThe same committee also advanced legislation – House Bill 240 – that would require schools to administer a reading assessment to kindergarten students at the end of the academic year. Students who fail to meet grade-level benchmarks and standards would likely need to repeat kindergarten under the proposal.\nTwo bills related to driving are also picking up momentum.\nSenate Bill 99 would forbid drivers from using a personal communication device while operating a motor vehicle. The bill provides some exceptions for emergency use and for adults who use hands-free options. It cleared the Senate Transportation Committee on Wednesday.\nHouse Bill 15 would reduce the minimum age for getting a learner's permit in Kentucky from 16 to 15 years old. It cleared the House Transportation Committee on Tuesday and passed off the House floor Thursday. The bill now heads to the Senate.\nMore than one third of the 2025 legislative session is now over, and many other bills made progress this week. Here's a look at some of the bills that were on the move:\nEducator Preparation Programs – House Bill 251 would establish the Education Professional Standards Board as the primary oversight authority for teacher education programs at state colleges and universities. The Council on Postsecondary Education currently serves in that role. The House Committee on Postsecondary Education advanced the legislation Tuesday.\nCigar Bars – House Bill 211 would authorize cigar bars that generate at least 15% of their revenue from cigar and pipe products to operate in communities that otherwise prohibit smoking. In addition to the revenue threshold, cigar bars would need to meet a series of other requirements in the bill. HB 211 won support in the House Local Government Committee on Tuesday.\nManufactured Housing – House Bill 160 would prohibit local governments from adopting or enforcing zoning regulations that treat manufactured homes differently from single-family homes. HB 160 cleared the House Committee on Local Government on Tuesday.\nInsurance Fraud – Senate Bill 24 would expand the definition of property and casualty insurance fraud to help crack down on unscrupulous contractors and public adjusters who charge unnecessary or fraudulent fees. The Senate Banking and Insurance Committee passed the bill Tuesday.\nProtective Orders – House Bill 38 would create tougher penalties for people who repeatedly violate protective orders. Offenders could face a class D felony if they violate an order three times within five years and the third violation involves the use or threat of violence. The House Judiciary Committee voted in support of the measure Wednesday.\nHomeowner Tax Exemptions – Senate Bill 67 proposes a constitutional amendment that would exempt homeowners who are 65 and older from paying property taxes that result from higher assessments on their permanent residence. The measure cleared the Senate State and Local Government Committee on Wednesday.\nSexual Extortion – Senate Bill 73 seeks to clamp down on sexual extortion by creating tougher penalties for offenders and more legal remedies for victims. It also requires schools and colleges to educate students and parents about the issue and display resources for reporting. The Senate passed the legislation Wednesday.\nChoking Prevention – If a school acquires an anti-choking device, House Bill 44 would require the school to ensure that cafeteria staff and others are trained on using the device, along with the Heimlich maneuver. The bill would also provide some protection against civil liabilities if the student is injured during the intervention. HB 44 advanced off the House floor on Wednesday.\nChevron Deference – Under Senate Bill 84, courts could no longer defer to a state agency's interpretation when dealing with ambiguity in statutes, administrative regulations or orders, a practice known as Chevron deference. The Senate Judiciary Committee gave the bill a nod on Thursday.\nJuvenile Justice – Senate Bill 111 builds on a multi-year effort to reform Kentucky's juvenile justice system. The bill aims to strengthen the process for assessing youth with severe behavioral challenges and developing an appropriate treatment and placement plan. It also calls for two female-only detention centers and seeks to establish a detention center for high acuity youth. The measure advanced out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\nTen Commandments – House Joint Resolution 15 seeks to return a granite monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments to the Capitol grounds for permanent display. The House State Government Committee gave the resolution a green light Thursday.\nSexual Assault Response Training – House Bill 219 would require emergency medical providers to receive sexual assault emergency response training. The House Health Services Committee approved the bill Thursday.\nGovernment Services – House Bill 182 would forbid state and local government entities from using the word \"free\" to describe any benefit, product or service financed with public funds. The House State Government Committee passed the legislation Thursday.\nSchool Athletics – Under Senate Bill 120, school coaches would receive training on the duties and procedures for reporting child abuse. The legislation would also add language to sports participation forms telling parents and students about the right to report abuse and how to make a report. The Senate Education Committee passed the bill Thursday.\nWater Regulations – Senate Bill 89 would change how state law defines waterways in Kentucky to align with recent changes on the federal level. Lawmakers have debated the impact of the change on environmental regulations in Kentucky, particularly regarding ephemeral waterways. The measure cleared the Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee on Wednesday and won support on the Senate floor Friday.\nFriday marked day 12 of this year's short, 30-day session. Lawmakers are scheduled to reconvene on Tuesday, Feb. 18, which is the last day to file new bills in the Senate. The next day is the last day to file new bills in the House.\nKentuckians can track the action this year through Legislative Record webpage, which allows users to read bills and follow their progression through the chambers.\nCitizens can also share their views on issues with lawmakers by calling the General Assembly's toll-free message line at 1-800-372-7181.\nFRANKFORT — A measure to improve and expand services for youth with severe behavioral and emotional challenges received approval from the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday as part of a multi-year effort to reform juvenile justice in Kentucky.\nSen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, testified that the bill he's sponsoring – Senate Bill 111 – reflects the efforts of a working group dedicated to the issue.\nThe legislation focuses on children who have acute mental illness and receive services from the state Cabinet for Health and Family Services while also being involved with the state Department of Juvenile Justice, he said.\n\"We still have kids in facilities today that are in juvenile detention centers. Although I feel the treatment has gotten better, they're still not where they need to be and where they can receive the best care in the safest environment for their situation,\" Carroll said.\nHe noted that the U.S. Department of Justice has been in Kentucky investigating issues involving juvenile justice detention centers.\nSB 111 seeks to strengthen the process for assessing high acuity youth and develop an appropriate treatment and placement plan. If a youth at a psychiatric or pediatric teaching hospital commits or incites violence, the bill provides a process for them to be removed.\nIt also includes a procedure for high acuity youth to move to a lower continuum of care if the treating physician determines that the current level of care is no longer needed, Carroll said.\n\"Many hospitals are reluctant to take children. Under current statute, as it is interpreted, once they receive these children, they have to keep these children. If they assault staff, they still have to keep the children. Police will not remove them from the facility,\" Carroll said.\nSB 111 also seeks to establish a detention center dedicated to high acuity youth. It would provide the highest level of care and serve children who are currently incarcerated or detained in juvenile detention centers, Carroll said.\nThe bill would also require the Department of Juvenile Justice to operate at least two female-only detention centers and to separate violent and nonviolent youth.\nCarroll said preliminary cost estimates would be $45 million each for the female detention centers and an additional $5 million to complete design work for the high acuity mental health detention center.\nSenate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, said he advised Carroll to keep cost estimates in the bill whether or not this legislative session is opened up to budget-related legislation.\n\"…Everybody needs to understand implementation of this bill, which I think everyone knows is probably needed, will come with a price tag. If not this year, it will probably become next year,\" he said.\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald L. Thomas, D-Lexington, said new facilities would be expensive, but they are needed.\n\"It's costly. It's going to cost us a lot of money to get this right and to construct and develop facilities that are going to satisfy both our needs and the concerns of the United States Department of Justice,\" he said.\nThe bill now heads to the full Senate.\nFRANKFORT — Rep. Rebecca Raymer, R-Morgantown, hopes two pieces of legislation she's sponsoring would help Kentuckians access better care after a sexual assault.\nThe House Health Services Committee approved House Bill 219 and House Concurrent Resolution 20 on Thursday.\nHB 219 would require emergency medical providers to receive sexual assault emergency response training, and HCR 20 would direct the Legislative Research Commission (LRC) to study access to sexual assault nurse examiners (SANE) in the commonwealth.\nThe training would be conducted by the state's Sexual Assault Response Team Advisory Committee.\nRaymer said she started working on the legislation after learning about gaps in coverage for sexual assault patients in emergency rooms across Kentucky.\n\"While that is a big problem that we need to address, and I think it's a multi-faceted problem, it requires some research and some data for us to know how to correctly address it,\" Raymer said.\nRep. Mary Lou Marzian, D-Louisville, asked Raymer if she's spoken to any of the SANE nurses about the bill.\nRaymer said she has not reached out to the nurses directly, but the Kentucky Hospital Association and the Kentucky Medical Association did not have an issue with the legislation.\nHB 219 would not mandate a certificate-type program, only training, Raymer added.\n\"This would just allow patients to be referred to the resources that they need in the emergency department, and we would protect the evidence and also ensure the patients aren't being sent away to another facility?\" Committee Chair Rep. Kimberly Poore Moser, R-Taylor Mill, asked.\nRaymer said, \"yes.\"\nUltimately, HB 219 would be \"temporary fix\" for a larger problem, Raymer said. That's where HCR 20 comes in.\n\"What we really want is we want those sexual assault nurse examiners that have that training in these hospitals,\" Raymer said. \"We want them to be there. When our citizens, at possibly one of the most vulnerable times in their life, walk into an ER, they need to have the correct treatment by the correct individual.\"\nThe LRC report under HCR 20 would hopefully give the legislature the information it needs to draft legislation to fix the sexual assault care issues at Kentucky hospitals, Raymer said.\n\"It directs LRC to conduct a study looking at where we have gaps in coverage. Why do we have gaps? Try to find out what hospitals are doing when there isn't a sexual assault nurse examiner on staff,\" Raymer said.\nIf approved, LRC would submit the report by December 2025.\nMoser said the Sexual Assault Advisory Committee has been asking for more SANE nurses for years.\n\"I think this would support that,\" Moser added. \"We will be able to actually see the data, so I think that's really important.\"\nHB 219 and HCR 20 are now before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A bill that seeks to improve safety on roads and highways in Kentucky was given the green light Wednesday during a Senate Transportation Committee meeting with an 8-1-1 vote.\nSen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville, is sponsoring Senate Bill 99 with Committee Chair Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon.\n\"It establishes that a person is not allowed to use that personal communication device to write, to send or to read texts while they are operating a motor vehicle,\" Douglas testified.\nDouglas said the bill is needed to prevent catastrophic injuries and deaths, and the measure would improve the safety of pedestrians in cities, those running on the side of the road and those out walking with children on two-lane country roads.\n\"I'm looking to improve the safety of operating motor vehicles in the Commonwealth of Kentucky as well as those who are not distracted. We often forget the other people involved in the accident,\" he said.\nHigdon said the bill includes provisions that truck drivers and bus drivers are already used to.\n\"This is a bill that 120,000 Kentuckians already abide by because it's the exact language that's included in a CDL national law pertaining to truck drivers and bus drivers. They have to stay off the phone, so this has already been applied in Kentucky,\" he said.\nThe measure would still permit adult drivers to access personal communication devices using hands-free options.\nBut the bill would prohibit anyone under the age of 18 from using a personal communication device in any manner while operating a motor vehicle, including hands-free operations, Douglas said.\nVehicle operators would still be allowed to use devices to report illegal activity or summon first responders. The measure would also allow those under the age of 18 to use GPS.\nDouglas testified that school bus drivers with commercial driver's licenses are subject to different state laws, and the bill calls for the state transportation cabinet to update some regulations according to advances in technology.\nViolations of the proposed law would result in a $100 fine. Those under 18 would receive a 90-day license revocation for a violation.\n\"Some may look at this and say that's just entirely too long. Would you say that if it was your mother who was hit by the driver? Would you say that if it was your daughter who was hit by that driver, and you're never going to see them again? I don't think so,\" Douglas said.\nSenate Majority Whip Mike Wilson, R-Bowling Green, voted for the bill, and said its provisions would improve motorcyclists' safety.\nWhen cyclists are hit by another vehicle, the majority of cases are due to distracted driving,\" he said. \"And this is a bill that they have wanted for a long time, so I'm very proud to vote for that.\"\nSen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester, also voted for the bill, and said he's seen statistics showing that hands-free usage makes roads safer and that drivers adapt to the changes.\n\"While I was in the trucking industry, we went through the transition from talking on your phone the way we all talk on our phone to the hands-free laws that were passed. I remember the reluctance,\" he said.\nSen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville, also cast a vote for the bill and thanked the bill's sponsors.\n\"I really do believe that this is going to save lives, and I'm very grateful to the sponsors for bringing it forward,\" she said.\nThe bill now heads to the full Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — Kentuckians wrongfully convicted of a felony may soon have the right to receive restitution\nHouse Majority Whip Jason Nemes, R-Middletown, presented House Bill 206 to the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. He was joined by several exonerees who shared their experiences and struggles with the committee.\n\"I would like to talk about my support for this bill, how when I was released, housing was difficult,\" said exoneree Paul Hurt. \"I was fortunate enough to have family members still living. A lot of exonerees do not have that luxury of people to help them when they're released. And we're not afforded very much as wrongfully convicted exonerees.\"\nUnder HB 206, Nemes said only Kentuckians who can prove actual innocence would be awarded compensation.\n\"The most important thing to know about this bill is you have to prove actual innocence,\" he said. \"This is not just 'the constable blundered,' or reversal of a conviction or even a pardon. That's not enough. You have to prove that you're actually innocent of the crime for which you were convicted and served time.\"\nIf it becomes law, innocent individuals who file a claim in circuit court within two years of being exonerated would be awarded $65,000 per year of imprisonment. If that person was on death row, they would be awarded $75,000 per year, according to the legislation.\nClaimants would also receive $32,500 for each year they were released on parole, under post-incarceration supervision or wrongfully registered as a sex offender, whichever is greater.\nExonerees may also be eligible to receive other compensation under this bill, such as tuition assistance and attorney's fees.\nWinnie Ye with The Innocence Project said 38 states, Washington D.C. and the federal government have all enacted wrongful conviction compensation laws.\n\"Wrongful convictions are a grave injustice,\" Ye said. \"They're a symptom of our broken criminal legal system. And one way that we can try to address this is by promoting this bill today.\"\nRep. Patrick Flannery, R-Olive Hill, said he wouldn't call the legal system broken, but he agrees the state should try to do the right thing when a mistake is made, which is why he supports HB 206.\nFlannery said he likes the actual innocence provision of the legislation, but suggested the burden of proof be higher.\n\"Would it perhaps be better to have a higher standard of clear and convincing (evidence), given the gravity of what we're dealing with?\" Flannery asked.\nAccording to Ye, HB 206 follows the same burden of proof standard set by 14 other states. Nemes said he understands the argument Flannery is making and he's open to discussing it further.\nThe House Judiciary Committee unanimously approved HB 206.\nIn explaining her \"yes\" vote, House Minority Whip Lindsey Burke, D-Lexington, said she is grateful for the legislation, but wishes it also included a provision that would provide wrongfully convicted Kentuckians a certificate of actual innocence.\nRep. T.J. Roberts, R-Burlington, also expressed support for HB 206.\n\"This is a crucial, crucial first step in ensuring accountability as a government,\" Roberts said.\nHB 206 now goes before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A measure to help tackle insurance fraud in Kentucky – Senate Bill 24 – gained unanimous approval Tuesday from legislators on the Senate Banking and Insurance Committee.\nThe legislation would expand the definition of property and casualty insurance fraud to help crack down on nefarious contractors and public adjusters who charge unnecessary or fraudulent fees or who surprise consumers with exorbitant charges, supporters testified.\nSen. Rick Girdler, R-Somerset, is sponsoring the bill. He said it doesn't deal with insurance claims related to bodily injury, only property and casualty insurance. The proposed changes would add more teeth to the law, he said.\n\"You have to prosecute these people,\" Girdler said. \"If you don't prosecute them, we're in trouble.\"\nEric DeCampos of the National Insurance Crime Bureau testified that the bill would provide law enforcement personnel with additional tools to investigate insurance fraud and close loopholes in state laws that are being exploited by fraudsters.\nChris Nolan, testifying on behalf of the Insurance Institute of Kentucky, told committee members that Kentuckians are familiar with storms and catastrophes that have become common. He said the events give unscrupulous people opportunities to commit insurance fraud and prey upon already vulnerable consumers.\n\"As many of you already know, property and casualty insurance fraud is not a victimless crime. It's estimated that the cost to a single family each year is between $400 and $700 in increased premiums due to insurance fraud,\" he said.\nNolan said most contractors and adjustors do a great job in providing services to help people rebuild, but some contractors and public adjusters charge unnecessary, exorbitant, or fraudulent fees to inflate insurance claims.\nSen. Brandon J. Storm, R-London, asked those testifying about insurance fraud enforcement.\n\"Is this an issue that commonwealth's attorneys across the commonwealth are not prosecuting insurance fraud,\" he asked. \"Because if that's the case, can you show me a commonwealth's attorney in Kentucky that's not doing their job as it relates to insurance fraud enforcement?\nNolan said an insurance fraud task force meets quarterly, and Department of Insurance investigators update stakeholders regarding the millions of dollars they recover from fraud. Additionally, officials of the DOI have been referring cases to the Kentucky attorney general for prosecution.\nSenate Minority Whip David Yates, D-Louisville, said he can support the bill because it clarifies criminal intent.\n\"I appreciate your willingness to work with this bill to make sure that it's narrowly tailored and actually goes to making sure that someone has criminal intent,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — Kentuckians looking for a more convenient way to renew their driver's license may soon have more options under House Bill 161.\nThe House Transportation Committee approved the bill on Tuesday. Primary sponsor, Rep. Kevin Jackson, R-Bowling Green, said the legislation would allow third-party entities to offer driver's license renewal services.\n\"This legislation would leverage a tool already being used in other states to increase the access and availability of driver's license renewal services for Kentuckians,\" Jackson said, reiterating this bill would be for renewals only.\nIn 2022, the Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation to create 34 regional centers for issuing driver's licenses and renewals, which was a change from the services being offered in all 120 counties. Jackson said this has caused issues for many Kentuckians.\n\"Many folks are forced to drive long distances, wait in long lines, and deal with people they've never met before,\" he said. \"We ask the public to get online to make appointments, but many don't have a computer or Wi-Fi.\"\nToday, roughly 28 states allow third-party entities, like AAA or insurance offices, to offer driver's license renewals, Jackson said.\nUnder HB 161, businesses seeking to offer driver's license renewal services would have to undergo an approval process through the Transportation Cabinet.\n\"Allowing third-party entities to issue driver's license renewals will help streamline the process and make it more accessible for all Kentuckians,\" Jackson said.\nRep. Daniel Elliott, R-Danville, said he noticed the bill mentioned there would be a fee for the service.\n\"Do you have any idea what that range would be?\" Elliott asked. \"Because sometimes fees can get pretty exorbitant, but I think the point that you've made is really good in terms of our inaccessibility to these regional offices, and that does disproportionality affect older folks.\"\nJackson said his research showed renewing at a third-party location would cost an extra $2 to $5 compared to what it would cost at a regional center.\nTwo lawmakers had additional questions about the ability of the third-party entities to do driver's license renewals.\nRep. Matthew Lehman, D-Newport, asked Jackson if Kentuckians would be able to renew a REAL ID at a third-party site. After May 7, a 2005 federal law will go into effect requiring Americans to have a REAL ID or a passport in order to board a commercial airplane.\nJackson said, yes, the third-party site would be able to do renewals, but would not be able to issue a brand-new REAL ID.\nRep. Anne Gay Donworth, D-Lexington, asked Jackson if the third-party entities would be able to do the new state-required vision test for driver's license renewals.\nJackson confirmed the vision test would not be an issue.\n\"They would have to have the refraction machine in these locations just like they would at the 34 driver's license centers,\" he said.\nIn addition to wanting more driver's license renewal location options, Kentuckians have also been asking lawmakers to allow more options for driver's tests, Rep. Tom Smith, R-Corbin, said.\nSmith asked Jackson if allowing sheriff's departments to be trained to offer driver's tests is something he considered. Currently, only Kentucky State Police can administer driver's tests.\nJackson said HB 161 only focuses on renewals, but it might be something the general assembly considers in the future.\n\"We didn't deal with that in this,\" he said. \"We wanted to basically stick our toe in the water and try renewals this way, but I could see in the future that possibly would be something that we could do.\"\nHB 161 is now before the full House for consideration.\nLawmakers resume 2025 session with action on key income tax measure\nFRANKFORT — The Kentucky General Assembly reconvened in Frankfort this week for Part II of the 2025 legislative session, and lawmakers were eager to begin moving bills on health care, gubernatorial pardons and public safety.\nClose to 20 bills have passed out of committee so far, and a handful have cleared at least one chamber. But no measure has advanced with more momentum than House Bill 1, the latest step in a multi-year effort to gradually reduce and eliminate Kentucky's income tax.The legislation was resting close to the finish line when lawmakers concluded the first part of the session in January. The Senate wasted no time Tuesday passing the bill off the chamber floor and sending it to the governor's desk.\nHB 1 will cut Kentucky's income tax rate from 4% to 3.5% beginning next year. The measure has carried bipartisan support this session even as lawmakers in both chambers have sparred over the impact of tax cuts. The governor signed the bill on Thursday, making it the first bill to become law in 2025.\nThe Senate was also moving deliberately this week on Senate Bill 17, which seeks to create a statutory and regulatory framework to operate freestanding birthing centers in Kentucky.\nDifferent versions of the bill have been discussed for years as supporters have sought to find common ground among a wide gamut of stakeholders.\nThe latest proposal appears to be advancing with more support. It won passage in the Senate Health Services Committee on Wednesday and advanced off the Senate floor Friday with a 34-0 vote and three pass votes.\nAnother measure clearing the Senate was Senate Bill 126, which proposes to amend the state constitution and limit the governor's ability to grant pardons or commutations either just before an election or in the final months before they leave office.\nSB 126 advanced out of the Senate State and Local Government Committee on Wednesday and breezed off the Senate floor Friday with a near-unanimous vote.\nIf the bill wins final passage this year, Kentucky voters would still need to ratify the amendment before it could take effect.\nMeanwhile in the House, a bill that seeks to prevent choking deaths in schools took an early step after the mother of 8-year-old Landon McCubbins provided moving testimony to the House Primary and Secondary Education Committee.\nLandon died at school in 2022 while choking on a bouncy ball, and House Bill 44 would clear the way for schools to deploy anti-choking devices in such cases after other attempts to save a student's life have failed.\nIt won committee approval Wednesday and now heads to the full House.\nAlso on Wednesday, the Senate Transportation Committee moved a bill that would levy a new $200 fee against \"super speeders,\" a proposed term for those convicted of driving more than 25 miles per hour over the speed limit on a state highway.\nRevenue from the legislation – Senate Bill 57 – would help fund Kentucky's emergency trauma network.\nSexual extortion was another issue to capture attention this week after the Senate Judiciary Committee heard stirring testimony Thursday on Senate Bill 73. The measure seeks to make sexual extortion a felony in Kentucky and provide victims with more legal remedies.\nCommittee members voted 7-0 to send the bill to the full Senate.\nTwenty-two days remain in this year's short, 30-day session, and lawmakers are scheduled to reconvene on Tuesday in the Old State Capitol building in downtown Frankfort.\nThe Old Capitol served as the center of state government from 1830 to 1910, and in a nod to legislative history, the General Assembly typically conducts floor proceedings in the building once each session.\nAs always, Kentuckians can track the action this year through the Legislative Record webpage, which allows users to read bills and follow their progression through the chambers.\nCitizens can also share their views on issues with lawmakers by calling the General Assembly's toll-free message line at 1-800-372-7181.\nFRANKFORT — Lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced a bill Thursday to combat sexual extortion in Kentucky after hearing impassioned testimony.\nSen. Julie Raque Adams, R-Louisville, is sponsor of Senate Bill 73, which she said would strengthen laws by making sexual extortion a felony and empower victims by giving them clear legal remedies to seek justice and recover damages, among other measures.\"Sexual extortion is one of the most dangerous and rapidly growing crimes targeting young people today. It is calculated, it is cruel and it thrives on fear and silence,\" she said. \"Too many kids today are being manipulated into situations that they don't know how to escape from.\"\nAdams defined sextortion as a form of exploitation that occurs when someone obtains sexually explicit images – sometimes generated by artificial intelligence – of someone and threatens to release them unless their demands are met. That might include monetary, sexual or any other requests. Abusers often use social media platforms, online gaming sites and messaging applications to target victims.\nTestifying with Adams were bill advocates Sara Collins, a Louisville-based attorney, and Lady Tee Thompson, who fights against human trafficking and advocates for human rights.\n\"I'm here with an appeal – a plea on behalf of our children, our communities, our humanity. The crisis of sextortion and sextortion-based trafficking is not a shadow lingering in some distant land. It is here. It is real. It is devouring the innocence of our youth,\" Thompson said.\nCollins said she testified on behalf of a client who is known as \"Jane Doe,\" and whose story is unforgettable and illustrates how important passage of the bill is.\n\"No one is exempt from being a victim, and predators are very difficult to identify,\" she said\nCollins testified that in 2020, a former Louisville Metro police detective sexually extorted at least 25 women, and she called him a \"very dangerous predator.\"\n\"He is not a registered sex offender. He has internet access. And, my client, who is one of his victims, phoned me a few months ago to tell me she ran into him in Kroger,\" Collins said.\nShe pointed out that the bill must pass because criminal and civil law – federal or in Kentucky – inadequately addresses sexual extortion.\n\"Currently, sextortion is prosecuted both civilly and criminally under a patchwork of laws that really do not address the problem,\" Collins said.\nSen. Matthew Deneen, R-Elizabethtown, thanked the three women who testified and said Adams' legislative work to fight sexual assault, abuse and sexual extortion is commendable. He said he looks forward to supporting the bill on the Senate floor.\n\"As a former principal, I see this rampantly throughout our school systems, and I appreciate the efforts to curtail this,\" he said.\nSen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, also vice chair of the committee, said he agrees with most of the measures in the bill and \"extortion in and of itself is both a criminal and a civil offense.\"\nWheeler asked about a portion of the bill dealing with suicide and how it would be judged in statute.\nAdams said this portion could be clarified, and she's open to a floor amendment.\nSen. Michael J. Nemes, R-Shepherdsville, said it's terrible that those who commit sexual extortion keep ahead \"on how to do these dastardly things,\" and he appreciates the legislation.\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald L. Thomas, D-Lexington, said sexual extortion is very real, and he wants to do everything he can to protect his young granddaughters.\nAdams said it's time to protect children against sexual extortion and she looks forward to working on the bill as it moves forward.\n\"The perpetrators move faster than our laws do,\" she said. \"I'm excited to make this bill even stronger and better and without any unintended consequences.\"\nFRANKFORT — The Kentucky General Assembly will celebrate the rich history of the legislature next week by convening for a day in the Old State Capitol building in downtown Frankfort.\nThe Kentucky Senate and House of Representatives will gavel into session at 2 p.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 11, inside the building's historic chambers. The Old Capitol, located at 300 W. Broadway St., is a National Historic Landmark that served as the center of state government from 1830 to 1910.\"Kentucky has a rich and storied history. I always enjoy visiting the Old Capitol and reflecting on the influential figures who helped shape the Commonwealth we call home today,\" said Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester. \"As we honor those who came before us, we also celebrate their legacy and the heritage of 'My Old Kentucky Home.'\"\nHouse Speaker David W. Osborne, R-Prospect, added, \"Our historic Old State Capitol witnessed several critical chapters in Kentucky's history and today serves as a reminder that our Commonwealth has overcome great challenges and emerged stronger than ever. Lawmakers have stood within the walls of the House and Senate and debated the merits of suffrage, secession, and the adoption of two state constitutions. Our visit underscores the General Assembly's enduring commitment to enacting legislation that reflects our state's evolving needs, while preserving the values of our citizens, essentially shaping the course of our shared history and future.\"\nKentuckians can view the proceedings via livestream on Kentucky Educational Television's website at www.ket.org/legislature Proceedings will also be broadcast on KET KY, the Kentucky Channel.\nCredentialed media will be admitted into the Old Capitol chambers as space permits. Interested media should contact Laura Leigh Goins at Laura.Goins@kylegislature.gov about space availability in the House and Angela Billings at Angela.Billings@kylegislature.gov about space availability in the Senate.\nBoth the House and Senate plan to adjourn for the day at the Old Capitol and will not return to the present-day Capitol for proceedings on the floors.\nThe Old State Capitol, completed in 1830 and used until 1910, is a vital part of Kentucky's history as a center of significant legislative activity and an architectural gem.\nAs the third of four capitol buildings in the state, the Old State Capitol is a symbol of Kentucky's democratic values and civic pride. Designed in the Greek Revival style, the building embodies the ideals of democracy and serves as a lasting reminder of the state's early years and political evolution.\nBeyond its role as the seat of government, the Old State Capitol is where some of Kentucky's most influential leaders debated and made decisions on issues that defined the nation's future. Topics such as slavery, secession, women's rights and civil rights were central to discussions that shaped Kentucky's trajectory during a period of profound political and social change.\nNow a National Historic Landmark, the Kentucky Historical Society (KHS) manages the Old State Capitol. In addition to preserving the building's architectural significance, KHS is committed to transforming it into a hub for civics education.\nKHS offers a variety of programs, exhibits and tours designed to engage visitors and students with Kentucky's early political history. By exploring the key decisions and debates that took place in this historic space, KHS fosters reflection on how those choices continue to shape the state and its people today.\nMore information about the Old State Capitol is available on the Kentucky Historical Society website.\nFRANKFORT — The Senate Transportation Committee advanced a bill Wednesday that would levy a new $200 fee against \"super speeders\" to help fund an emergency trauma network in Kentucky.\nThe legislation, Senate Bill 57, cleared the committee with a 7-1 vote. Under the proposal, a motorist would be considered a \"super speeder\" if convicted of driving more than 25 miles per hour over the speed limit on a state highway.Fees collected from such speeders would be used to boost Kentucky's trauma care system fund, a rural hospital preservation fund, an emergency medical technician scholarship fund, and a fund to help public schools purchase automated external defibrillators.\nThe bill's sponsor, Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, said the measure is modeled after legislation in Georgia. He said the Kentucky legislature passed a bill in 2008 to establish a trauma care network, but it has never received an appropriation.\n\"One of my frequent complaints as a legislator here is that we never measure the cost of doing nothing, and certainly by not funding this network has cost us dearly not just in terms of lives – probably during that period we lost 85,000 lives due to trauma – average about 5,000 a year,\" he said. \"And if we had a network in place, probably conservatively, we could have saved at least 5,000 lives.\"\nMeredith said many trauma patients have had to leave Kentucky to receive treatment, and millions of Medicaid dollars have been spent in other states.\nDr. Zachary D. Warriner, a trauma surgeon at the University of Kentucky, testified he's originally from Southeastern Kentucky, and providing appropriate trauma care for everyone in the state is paramount.\n\"I'm proud to be from here. I'm not proud of some of our trauma outcomes despite the fact that we've implemented this system in 2008,\" he said. \"I think that it's startling to me that depending on where you fall or wreck your vehicle in our state, that your likelihood of survival can be dramatically altered just based on that geography.\"\nHe said if the legislature earmarks funds adequately, there will be a dramatic impact on Kentuckians' lives and there is data to support that.\nSen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, asked Meredith about the number of tickets being issued on limited access highways versus urban areas. He voted against the measure, citing the funding mechanism.\n\"I think we can agree that if you're going 25 miles and over in the middle of a city, that's dangerous, and I can see a reason for a super speeder fine,\" he said. \"If you're trying to get home at 10 o'clock at night, and there's nobody on a limited access highway at all, frankly I would just adopt Montana's reasonable and prudent standard. And as long as you're not being unsafe, then I don't really think you should have to pay an additional fine.\"\nSen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, said he's concerned about air ambulance bills and asked if a fund or pool could be set up to help families defray the costs of services.\nMeredith said the network needs to be built, but he envisions some way to address this issue.\n\"It's economically killing for a lot of families,\" he said of the costs. \"We have to build the system first.\"\nSen. Gex Williams, R-Verona, said he supports the bill and supports improving the trauma treatment situation in Northern Kentucky.\n\"Right now, there is children's hospital, which is a Level 1 pediatric center in Cincinnati. Would love to open a hospital in Northern Kentucky, and they're prevented by certificate of need from doing so,\" he said.\nMeredith said the bill could change the trajectory of health care in Kentucky for almost every citizen.\n\"The other option that could be available to us if this bill doesn't pass is we have an appropriation request in the next budget cycle for $10 million. We know that's not going to happen, so this is a way to fund this system without costing the taxpayers any additional tax burden,\" he said.\nFRANKFORT — In 2022, 8-year-old Landon McCubbins choked on a bouncy ball in a Nelson County classroom.\nHis mother, Lauren McCubbins, told the House Primary and Secondary Education Committee on Wednesday her son died after all efforts to dislodge the bouncy ball from Landon's throat failed.\nRep. Candy Massaroni, R-Bardstown, said House Bill 44, also known as Landon's Law, could prevent what happened to Landon from happening to another Kentucky child. She is the primary sponsor of the legislation.\n\"Schools will be allowed to have life-saving, anti-choking devices in their schools while removing the liability from the schools (under this bill),\" Massaroni said. \"Choking is the leading cause of death in the U.S. for children under the age of 18.\"\nThe bill defines an anti-choking device as \"a portable suction device used to remove an airway obstruction during a choking emergency that has been registered as a Class II medical device with the United States Food and Drug Administration.\"\nThe device would be an option, not a requirement, for schools, according to the legislation.\nLauren McCubbins said HB 44 is something Landon would support. Weeks before he died, Landon wrote in his journal at school: \"One future technology that will change our lives is a robot that will help paramedics save people's lives.\"\n\"This is an 8-year-old child wanting technology that will help save lives and hoping that our future is better,\" Lauren McCubbins said. \"We are not asking you to skip all other emergency protocols. We are asking you to allow LifeVacs in schools to use them when there is no other option.\"\nRep. Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, asked Massaroni and McCubbins to describe the LifeVac device.\nMassaroni said a LifeVac is a simple, non-invasive device that fits over a child or adult's mouth. It uses suction to remove an obstruction from someone's throat. She said the device is registered with the FDA and in the process of becoming FDA approved.\n\"The CDC came out and recommended that anybody that wants to be ADA compliant should get them,\" Massaroni added.\nRep. Emily Callaway, R-Louisville, asked Massaroni if the Heimlich maneuver is included in the legislation.\nMassaroni said the legislation recommends typical protocols prior to using the LifeVac device, and the Heimlich maneuver is one of the first. The device is an alternative if the Heimlich maneuver does not work, she said.\nLauren McCubbins believes a LifeVac could have saved her son's life.\n\"A LifeVac is an alternative to dying,\" she said. \"Those emergency protocols failed my sweet boy on 11/21/22. There was not a LifeVac in school to even attempt to save him. My son may still be alive had there been. We are here today hoping that this never happens to any child again.\"\nThe House Primary and Secondary Education Committee unanimously approved Landon's Law. It now goes before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — A measure to cut the income tax rate in Kentucky – House Bill 1 – was the first bill in 2025 to gain Senate approval.\nWith a 34-3 vote on Tuesday, the Senate approved the measure that would reduce the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5% beginning Jan. 1, 2026. The House approved the bill in early January by a 90-7 vote and it now heads to the governor.\nSen. Christian McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, and chair of the Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee, said the general assembly created certain \"triggers\" several years ago to allow for the gradual lowering of the Kentucky income tax. The triggers require state coffers to meet savings and surplus thresholds before the tax rate can be lowered.\n\"It's been said that there are only two things in life that are certain: death and taxes,\" McDaniel said. \"…In the last seven years, we've added another thing that's fairly certain, which is the general assembly is going to do everything in its power, and frequently with success, to lower your taxes. And that's what House Bill 1 is all about.\"\nSen. Aaron Reed, R-Shelbyville, voted for the bill, and said it's part of a \"journey\" to reduce the state income tax rate to zero.\n\"Let's tackle the root of the problem by controlling spending and empowering our citizens. This tax cut will boost our economy and put more money back in the pockets of Kentuckians,\" he said. \"I vote yes for growth, yes for fiscal responsibility and yes for the future of the prosperity of our great state.\"\nHowever, a few lawmakers cited concerns with the plan during debate on the chamber floor.\nSen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, voted against the measure. She acknowledged that the bill is popular, but said it is \"putting way too many apples in a basket we can't get a hold of if we need.\" She also said she's concerned about risks with the bourbon industry in Kentucky and tariffs.\n\"Obviously, these are things that sound very attractive to people, very attractive,\" Berg said. \"I may be socially liberal, but I am extremely fiscally conservative, and I honestly know that sound finances is that you pay your bills first. You make sure that you're solvent, and you have enough money to cover exigencies as they come across.\"\nSen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, D-Louisville, also voted against the bill. She said she appreciates the intent of the legislation. However, she's concerned that the people who are making the most money stand to receive the most benefits from the reduction.\n\"I also worry about cutting our revenues at a time of such economic uncertainty. We don't know what tariffs, if any, might be coming. We don't know what federal funds, if any, might be going away. We don't know what impact, if any, that's going to have on us here in this state,\" she said.\nBut Sen. Michael J. Nemes, R-Shepherdsville, argued in favor, saying it's a great thing for people to keep more of their money.\n\"They earned it. It's their money, not ours. We think we know better what to do with their money than they do. I'm telling you, we do not,\" he said.\nSenate Minority Whip David Yates, D-Louisville, also voted for the bill, and said the measure shouldn't have anything to do with partisanship.\n\"I tried to talk to our nonbiased economic advisers about what would happen in going from a 4% to a 3.5% in our climate today is still safe. I do have fears of the future and I know how hard it is in order to reverse something like this,\" he said.\nThe Senate is adjourned until Wednesday at 2 p.m.\nFRANKFORT — Kentucky lawmakers spent the first week of the 2025 legislative session electing leaders, adopting rules for the chambers, and advancing a high-priority bill on tax reform close to the finish line.\nFriday marked day four of this year's short, 30-day session, and winter weather hasn't hampered the action in Frankfort. Legislators have filed more than 200 bills since the chambers gaveled into session on Tuesday.\nThe proposals touch everything from education and crime to more specific topics like water fluoridation, and they offer a glimpse of the issues lawmakers might look to tackle in the coming months.\nMajority lawmakers in both chambers have been signaling for weeks that tax reform would receive focus early in the session, and that proposal – House Bill 1 – was the only measure to begin moving this week.\nThe legislation is part of a multi-year effort to gradually reduce and eliminate Kentucky's income tax – so long as the state continues to meet certain revenue thresholds.\nHB 1 would cut the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5% starting in 2026. It cleared the House Appropriations and Revenue Committee on Wednesday and advanced off the House floor Thursday with a 90-7 vote after proponents staved off nearly a dozen floor amendments.\nDuring the hour-long debate, supporters said the change will encourage more growth and development in Kentucky while helping ease the burden on taxpayers. Critics, however, raised concerns that it will mostly benefit high earners and rob the state coffers of important revenue.\nThe Senate received the bill late Thursday, and the Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee took up the measure Friday morning, voting 11-0 to send HB 1 to the chamber floor for consideration during Part II of the session.\nIn addition to the tax discussion, the House and Senate welcomed a new class of legislators this week. Twenty-two new members were sworn into the General Assembly on Tuesday, including 16 in the House and six in the Senate.\nBoth chambers also saw a handful of leadership changes.\nIn the House, Rep. Pamela Stevenson, D-Louisville, will now serve as minority floor leader; Rep. Al Gentry, D-Louisville, will serve as minority caucus chair; and Rep. Lindsey Burke, D-Lexington, will serve as minority whip.\nIn the Senate, Sen. Max Wise, R-Campbellsville, was elected as majority floor leader; and Sen. Robby Mills, R-Henderson, will serve as majority caucus chair.\nOther leadership roles remained unchanged from last year.\nUnder the state constitution, the Kentucky General Assembly convenes in short sessions during odd-numbered years.

Jason Petrie, R-Elkton, HB 1 would reduce the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5% beginning Jan. 1, 2026.\nPetrie said the general assembly's journey to reducing the state income tax began in 2018, but picked up steam in 2022 with House Bill 8. HB 8 established a \"trigger\" system, which allows the legislature to reduce the income tax rate by either a half or a full percentage point if state revenues reach certain levels.\n\"It is before this body again, per formula, as a good, methodical, thoughtful, cautious approach to reducing the individual income tax rate to zero over time, but not so fast we hurt ourselves, or – more importantly – our constituents,\" Petrie said.\nEleven amendments were filed to make changes to HB 1 on the floor. Rep. Steven Doan, R-Erlanger, attempted to amend HB 1 to reduce the income tax to 3% in 2025 and bring it to zero by 2028.\n\"States like Texas, Tennessee and Florida have no individual income tax, which has been a significant draw for businesses and entrepreneurs seeking to minimize their tax burden,\" Doan said. \"By aligning with these states, Kentucky will be poised to see an influx of new businesses and residents, stimulating economic growth.\"\nThe House did not vote on the amendment after it was ruled unconstitutional by House Speaker David W. Osborne, R-Prospect. Petrie said reducing the income tax too quickly would lead to a \"severe\" budget deficit, which is against the Kentucky Constitution.\nRep. Adrielle Camuel, D-Lexington, also tried to amend HB 1. She suggested amending the bill to introduce a graduated income tax system, adding she has concerns over the future funding of public education under a consumption-based tax structure.\nBeginning in 2026, individuals making less than $90,000 annually would be taxed at 3.5% under her proposal. Her amendment would also put individuals making $90,000 to $100,000 in net income to be taxed at 3.75% and individuals making more than $100,000 a year to be taxed at 4%.\n\"Amendment 8 will provide a larger budget revenue stream for Kentucky, fulfill the majority's efforts to cut taxes for Kentuckians, and also give a greater tax cut and greater financial relief to the people who need it most,\" Camuel said.\nPetrie said he doesn't support Camuel's amendment because HB 1 is designed to reduce the tax burden for all Kentuckians.\nCamuel's amendment was not adopted.\nRep. Chad Aull, D-Lexington, was one of many lawmakers to speak on HB 1 during a more than an hour-long debate on the bill. He said he would be voting \"yes\" on the legislation, but he still has concerns.\n\"I wish the bill focused more on our working-class families, and was not drafted to disproportionally help those who have the most,\" Aull said.\nHouse Majority Whip Jason Nemes, R-Middletown, said he has seen the evolution of tax reform in Kentucky since he joined the general assembly in 2017 and it hasn't happened \"in a vacuum,\" but with careful consideration and conservative budgeting practices.\n\"This is a conservative approach to a conservative goal,\" Nemes said. \"This is a long play, and that's the reason we're doing this: to help the individual taxpayer, and to grow the pie for all of our people, and we have done that.\"\nThe House approved HB 1 by a 90-7 vote. It will now go before the Senate for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — Kentuckians may see another state income tax cut next year.\nThe House Appropriations and Revenue Committee started the process of reducing the state income tax from 4% to 3.5% beginning Jan. 1, 2026, by approving House Bill 1 on Wednesday.\nCommittee Chair Rep. Jason Petrie, R-Elkton, said HB 1 is the next step in a process that began with House Bill 8 in 2022 to reduce the state income tax. Petrie is the primary sponsor of HB 1.\nHB 8 established \"triggers\" that permit the general assembly to lower the state income tax rate by either a half or full percentage point once state revenues reach certain levels.\nRep. Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, asked Petrie what would happen if future projections indicate the general assembly should reverse the tax cut.\nPetrie said there are several ways the legislature could address the issue.\n\"You would reverse it by statutory amendment modification, just like we're doing in a different direction today,\" Petrie said. \"Or you would focus on budget, or you would focus on revenues and expenditures … those are three easy places to go.\"\nJason Bailey, executive director for the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, said Kentucky will face budgetary issues if cuts are made to the state income tax.\n\"A recent state forecast predicted revenues will decline by $213 million this year, and the state will face a shortfall,\" Bailey said.\nIn continuing the discussion on HB 1, House Minority Caucus Chair Al Gentry, D-Louisville, asked Petrie about the state moving toward an all consumption-based tax structure and working toward becoming a zero-income tax state.\n\"What is the general reason for doing that? Is it trying to promote growth for people moving into the state?\" Gentry asked.\nPetrie said that there is evidence that supports the theory that a lower income tax will lead to population and economic growth.\n\"There's a good amount of support for the theory that as the income tax becomes much more competitive with other states, there's reason for people to stay here, as well as locate here, as well as economic growth,\" Petrie said.\nThe committee approved HB 1 by a 17-0 vote with three members passing.\nGentry recorded a \"pass\" vote on HB 1 in committee, but said he may vote in favor of the legislation on the floor once he does more research.\n\"I don't see any reason to vote 'no' on this bill yet other than not really being in 100% agreement on the entire model of going to where we're going, because I feel like it benefits higher income people at the expense of lower income people,\" Gentry said.\nHB 1 will now go before the full House for consideration.\nFRANKFORT — State lawmakers are set to convene in Frankfort next week for the 2025 Regular Session of the Kentucky General Assembly, and Kentuckians have many ways to follow along with the action.\nKentuckians can use online resources to:\n-- See the General Assembly’s daily schedule\n-- Tune in to live coverage of legislative\nmeetings\n-- Find information on their legislators\n-- Contact lawmakers and offer feedback\n-- Read bills and resolutions\n-- Receive a notice when a bill advances\n-- See how lawmakers voted on bills and\nresolutions\n-- View materials on committee topics and\ntestimony\n-- Learn about the legislative process\nAll that and much more is available on the General Assembly Home Page: https://legislature.ky.gov/pages/index.aspx.\nFollowing the General Assembly’s work often begins with a daily look at the Legislative Calendar: https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/LegislativeCalendar.

In recent years, these costs have grown substantially—in some cases, growing at historically rapid rates. In this post, we provide a brief update on housing costs and affordability in California.\nCalifornia Home Prices Far Exceed the Rest of the Country. As shown above, California home prices have long been—and continue to be—much more expensive than the rest of the US. Prices for mid-tier homes are more than twice as expensive as the typical mid-tier US home. (Mid-tier homes reflect home values in the 35th to 65th percentile range.) Perhaps even more importantly for a first-time home buyer, a bottom-tier home in California is now about 30 percent more expensive than a mid-tier home in the rest of the U.S.—a gap that has widened over the last decade but narrowed slightly over the past year. (Bottom-tier homes are those with values in the 5th to 35th percentile range.)\nDramatic Increase in Monthly Payments for a Newly Purchased Home Between 2020 and 2022 Has Been Maintained. Monthly payments for a newly purchased mid-tier home—including mortgage, taxes, and homeowners’ insurance—fell in the first 9 months of 2025 but remain much higher than before 2020. Payments for a mid-tier home were over $5,500 a month in September 2025—a 74 percent increase since January 2020. Payments for a bottom-tier home were over $3,400 per month—an 78 percent increase since January 2020. Also, the gap between the monthly costs of purchasing a bottom-tier home versus renting are near levels that have not been seen since the housing bubble in the mid-2000s. This rapid increase in monthly costs for homebuyers was driven by higher home prices and increasing mortgage rates, both of which we discuss in more detail below.\nGrowth in Home Prices and Mortgage Rates Have Made Purchasing a Home Much More Expensive. As shown above, monthly payments for a newly purchased mid-tier home have increased by almost $2,400 since January 2020. In 2020, there was actually a slight drop in monthly payments as prevailing mortgage rates dipped. However, in 2021, rising home prices became the major driver of rising monthly payments, as homebuyers had to take out larger loans to pay for the more expensive homes. Subsequently, beginning in 2022, as the Federal Reserve began to increase interest rates to slow inflation, mortgage rates became the primary driver of the growing costs. The prevailing mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage increased from 2.7 percent in January 2021 to 7.6 percent in October 2023. (Mortgage rates declined to 6.25% in October 2025). Furthermore, when both mortgage rates and prices increase, there is a compounding effect on monthly home payments, as borrowers have to pay higher interest costs on higher loan amounts.\nRapid Mortgage Rate Increases Limits Homes Available For Purchase. The California housing market is facing a unique challenge due to the rapid rise in mortgage interest rates over the past few years. Before 2022, the average rate was around 3 percent. But by October 2022, it had surged to almost 7 percent and has remained high. This dramatic increase has created a stark divide - 79 percent of California homeowners currently have mortgage rates below 5 percent, while new buyers face the much higher rate. For an existing homeowner, the financial cost of selling their home with a low-rate mortgage and buying a new one at today's rates is significant. For example, if a homeowner with a mortgage rate of 5 percent sold their home and bought a new similarly-priced home at current interest rates, they would have monthly payments approximately 11 percent higher. For the typical homeowners, this amounts to over $195,000 more in payments over the life of a 30-year loan. As a result, many are choosing to stay put, significantly limiting the number of homes available for sale in the state's tight housing market.\nPurchasing A 2-Bedroom Home Now Much More Expensive Than Renting. Monthly rents have also grown significantly in recent years, but not as quickly as monthly payments needed to purchase a home. As shown above, monthly payments for a 2-bedroom home are about $2,010 (62 percent) more than renting an apartment or home.\nCosts of Buying A Home Have Grown by More Than Median Income. Affordability depends on both the costs of the housing, as well as the income and/or wages of households. Annual household income needed to qualify for a mortgage on a mid-tier California home in September 2025 was about $221,000—over 2 times the median California household income in 2024 ($102,000). For a bottom-tier home, about $136,000 in annual income is needed to qualify for a mortgage—about 33 percent higher than median household income in 2024.\nHousing Costs Have Grown More Quickly Than Wages. Since January 2020, California housing costs—especially the costs of purchasing a home—have grown more than California wages, as shown above. From January 2020 to September 2025, the growth in monthly payments for a mid-tier home (74 percent) and bottom-tier home (78 percent) have far exceeded growth in average hourly wages (25 percent). Rents have also grown more quickly than wages. Over the same time period, rents grew 42 percent.\nCosts Vary Dramatically by Location, Especially for Homebuyers. As shown in the figure above, the housing costs in certain parts of the state—mostly in the coastal areas—are significantly higher than other areas. Although there is significant variation in rents as well, the differences between locations are much smaller. Put another way, the difference in costs between buying and renting is generally much higher in the high-cost areas of the state.\nNorthern California Has Generally Had Slower Growth Than the Rest of the State. Housing costs have grown substantially in almost all areas of the state over the last few years. However, as shown in the figure above, the monthly costs associated with purchasing a bottom-tier home have grown more slowly in Northern California—most notably the Bay Area—than many other parts of the state. There has been a similar pattern of rent growth across the state. As shown in the figure below, rents in the Bay Area have grown very little since 2020, while rents have grown by 45 percent or more in many other parts of the state.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Living in decent, affordable, and reasonably located housing is one of the most important determinants of well–being for every Californian. More than just basic shelter, housing affects our lives in other important ways, determining our access to work, education, recreation, and shopping. The cost and availability of housing also matters for the state’s economy, affecting the ability of businesses and other employers to hire and retain qualified workers and influencing their decisions about whether to locate, expand, or remain in California.\nUnfortunately, housing in California is extremely expensive. Many households struggle to find housing that is affordable and meets their needs. Amid this challenge, many households make serious trade–offs in order to live here. Because of the important role housing plays in the lives of Californians, the state’s high housing costs are a major ongoing concern for state and local policy makers.\nThe purpose of this report is to provide the Legislature an overview of the state’s complex and expensive housing markets, encompassing both single–family homes and multi–family apartments. We pay particular attention to identifying what has caused housing prices to increase so quickly in recent decades, and provide information to assist the Legislature in making decisions that will affect the future performance of the state’s housing markets. The report covers four main questions:\nHome Prices and Rents Vary Widely Within California. In a state as large and economically diverse as California, some areas have much higher home prices and rents (and other areas much lower) than the statewide average. As shown in Figure 2, for example, home prices in California’s most expensive metropolitan area (or “metro”), San Francisco, are more than double the state average and about six times higher than Bakersfield, the state’s least expensive metro. (Throughout our report we use the U.S. census definitions of metropolitan areas—or metros. Census metros are comprised of counties—or, in some cases, a single county—that share similar socio–economic characteristics and surround a common urban core.) Rents vary throughout the state as well. The average monthly rent for a two–bedroom apartment in San Francisco ($2,000) was two and a half times greater than the average in Fresno or Bakersfield (both about $800).\nEven California’s Least Expensive Housing Markets Are More Expensive Than Average. Single–family home prices and apartment rents in less costly areas of the state, such as Fresno and Bakersfield, though considered inexpensive by California standards, are about average compared with the rest of the country. Each of the state’s other major metros are well–above the rest of nation, even California’s other major inland metros, Riverside–San Bernardino and Sacramento.\nCalifornia’s Home Prices and Rents Have Risen Faster Than U.S. Average Since the 1940s. Figure 3 shows how average U.S. and California home prices have changed over time. In 1940, the average California home cost about 20 percent more than the average U.S. home. By the end of the 1940s, the state’s home prices were 30 percent higher than average. Over the next 20 years—1950 through 1970—California home prices increased about as quickly as the national average. Beginning in about 1970, however, home prices throughout the state began to accelerate. Prices were 80 percent above U.S. levels by 1980, and by 2010, the typical California home was twice as expensive as the typical U.S. home. As of 2015, average California home prices were two–and–a–half times higher than average national home prices.\nMany Households Have Difficulty Affording Housing in California. As we describe in more detail later in this report, California’s high housing costs force many households to make serious trade–offs. In most instances, these trade–offs are particularly challenging for households with low incomes. Notable and widespread trade–offs include (1) spending a greater share of their income on housing, (2) postponing or foregoing homeownership, (3) living in more crowded housing, (4) commuting further to work each day, and (5) in some cases, choosing to work and live elsewhere.\nGovernment Housing Programs Ease Housing Costs for Some. Federal, state, and local government housing programs generally work in one of two ways, by: (1) increasing the supply of moderately priced housing or (2) reducing housing costs for some households.\n- Programs That Build New Housing. Federal, state, and local governments provide direct financial assistance—typically tax credits, grants, or low–cost loans—to housing developers for the construction of new rental housing. In exchange, developers reserve these units for lower–income households. (Until recently, local redevelopment agencies also provided this type of financial assistance.) Data suggests these programs together have subsidized the new construction of about 7,000 rental units annually in the state—or about 5 percent of total public and private housing construction—since the mid–1980s. In addition to direct subsidies, some local governments increase the supply of affordable housing by requiring developers of market–rate housing to set aside some of the units they are building for low– and moderate–income households, a policy called “inclusionary housing.”\n- Programs That Help Households Afford Housing. In addition to constructing new housing, governments have also taken steps to make existing housing more affordable. In some cases, the federal government makes payments to landlords—known as housing vouchers—on behalf of low–income tenants for a portion of a rental unit’s monthly cost. About 400,000 California households receive this type of housing assistance. In other cases, local governments limit how much landlords can increase rents each year for existing tenants. About 15 California cities have these so–called rent controls, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland.\nWhy Is Housing Expensive in California?\nA collection of factors drive California’s high cost of housing. First and foremost, far less housing has been built in California’s coastal areas than people demand. As a result, households bid up the cost of housing in coastal regions. In addition, some of the unmet demand to live in coastal areas spills over into inland California, driving up prices there too. Second, land in California’s coastal areas is expensive. Homebuilders typically respond to high land costs by building more housing units on each plot of land they develop, effectively spreading the high land costs among more units. In California’s coastal metros, however, this response has been limited, meaning higher land costs have translated more directly into higher housing costs. Finally, builders’ costs—for labor, required building materials, and government fees—are higher in California than in other states. While these higher building costs contribute to higher prices throughout the state, building costs appear to play a smaller role in explaining high housing costs in coastal areas. This section describes how each of these factors increase home prices and rents in California.\nBuilding Less Housing Than People Demand Drives High Housing Costs\nCalifornia Is Building Too Little Housing in Coastal Areas. California is a very desirable place to live, with temperate weather, long stretches of coastline, and highly educated and culturally diverse economic centers. Many households wish to live in California. However, some of California’s most sought after locations—its major coastal metros (Los Angeles, Oakland, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, and Santa Ana–Anaheim), where around two–thirds of Californians live—do not have sufficient housing to accommodate all of the households that want to live here. The lack of housing on the California coast means households wishing to live there compete for limited housing. This competition bids up housing costs.\nRising home prices and rents are a signal that more households would like to live in an area than there is housing to accommodate them. Housing developers typically respond to this excess demand by building additional housing. This does not appear to be true, however, in California’s coastal metros. Building activity during the recent housing boom demonstrates this. During the mid–2000s, housing prices were rising throughout the country and, in most locations, developers responded with additional building. As Figure 4 shows, however, new housing construction, as measured by building permits issued by local officials, remained flat in California’s coastal metros. We also find that building activity in California’s coastal metros has been significantly lower than in metros outside of California that have similar desirable characteristics—such as temperate weather, coastal proximity, and economic growth—and, therefore, likely have similar demand for housing. For example, Seattle—a coastal metro with economic characteristics and average temperatures that are similar to California’s Bay Area metros—added new housing units at about twice the rate as San Francisco and San Jose over the last two decades. (Specifically, Seattle’s housing stock—its total number of housing units—grew at an average annual rate of 1.4 percent per year while San Francisco and San Jose’s housing stock grew by only 0.7 percent per year.)\nBetween 1980 and 2010, construction of new housing units in California’s coastal metros was low by national and historical standards. During this 30–year period, the number of housing units in the typical U.S. metro grew by 54 percent, compared with 32 percent for the state’s coastal metros. Home building was even slower in Los Angeles and San Francisco, where the housing stock grew by only around 20 percent. As Figure 5 shows, this rate of housing growth along the state’s coast also is low by California historical standards. During an earlier 30–year period (1940 to 1970), the number of housing units in California’s coastal metros grew by 200 percent.\nJump in California Housing Costs Occurred as Building Slowed. A look at housing costs in California’s coastal metros in recent decades shows a connection between the slow rate of building and higher housing costs. The slowdown in building in California’s coastal metros corresponded with a substantial rise in housing costs relative to the rest of the country. In 1970, home prices in the state’s coastal metros were about 50 percent more expensive than in the rest of the country. This gap has widened considerably since that time. Homes in the coastal metros are now more than three times more expensive than the rest of the country. Similarly, rents have grown more expensive, with the gap between the coastal metros and the rest of the country increasing threefold since 1970 (from 16 percent more expensive to around 50 percent more expensive).\nLink Between Development and Housing Costs Exists Elsewhere Too. The same relationship between growth of housing supply and housing costs exists throughout the country, suggesting that what has occurred in California is not coincidental. Looking broadly at major metropolitan counties (counties comprising metros with a population of 500,000 or greater) throughout the country, places with slower housing growth generally have more expensive housing. Based on U.S. Census data, the median home price in 2010 was just over $300,000 in the fifth of counties that grew the slowest between 1980–2010, compared with $195,000 in the fifth of counties that grew the fastest.\nOur review indicates that that the relationship between growth of housing supply and increased housing costs is complex and affected by other factors—such as demographics, local economies, and weather. Nonetheless, using common statistical techniques to account for the influence of these other factors, there remains a strong relationship between home building and prices. For example, our analysis suggests that—after controlling for other factors—if a county with a home building rate in the bottom fifth of all counties during the 2000s had instead been among the top fifth, its median home price in 2010 would have been roughly 25 percent lower. Similarly, its median rent would have been roughly 10 percent lower.\nSpillover of Demand to Live on the Coast Affects Housing Costs in Inland California. In contrast to the coast, more home building has occurred in California’s inland metros (Bakersfield, Fresno, Riverside–San Bernardino, and Sacramento) than typical U.S. metros. California’s inland metros added housing at about twice the rate of the typical U.S. metro between 1980 and 2010. Yet housing costs in much of inland California are above average relative to the rest of the country. High housing costs in the state’s inland metros appear to result largely from their proximity to California’s coast. Some households and businesses that want to locate on California’s coast but find housing too expensive there locate in California’s inland metros instead. This displaced demand places pressure on inland housing markets and results in higher home prices and rents there. Examining the relationship between housing costs in neighboring counties throughout the country using U.S. Census data from 1980 and 2010, we find that this spillover effect is substantial. Our analysis suggests that—after accounting for a variety of other factors that can affect housing costs—a 10 percent increase in housing costs in a county is associated with a roughly 5 percent increase in housing costs in its neighboring counties.\nHigh Land Costs and Low Density Development Make Housing Expensive\nLand Costs Are High on the California Coast. Land prices on the California coast are among the highest in the country. In contrast, land prices in inland California typically are at or below the national average. Comparing land prices across metropolitan areas can be difficult, largely due to data limitations. Nonetheless, several estimates of land values are available in the economics literature and they find that land is considerably more expensive on California’s coast. One analysis of land sales between 2005 and 2010 found that land prices in California’s metros ranged from twice as expensive as the average U.S. metro (Oakland and San Diego) to more than four times as expensive (San Francisco). We also examined existing data to better understand the value of single–family home lots in different areas. Using American Housing Survey data from 2011, we found an even greater divergence between California and the rest of the country. Residential land in an average U.S. metro was valued at around $20,000 per acre, compared with over $150,000 in California’s coastal metros. Land values were highest in San Francisco, where an acre of land was valued at nearly $400,000.\nHigh Land Costs Can Be Offset Through Dense Development. Although high land costs can translate into higher home prices and rents, it is possible to offset the effects of high land costs through more dense development. (The density of housing refers to the number of housing units per unit of land—typically measured in units per acre. Higher–density housing, such as an apartment building, has more housing units per acre.) Building more units on the same plot of land allows a developer to spread land costs across more units, lessening the impact of land costs on the cost of each unit. This is because land costs are fixed and do not increase if a developer builds additional units. For example, if a developer builds five homes on a plot of land that costs $100,000, the land cost per unit is $20,000. Alternatively, if the developer builds ten homes on the same plot of land, the land cost per unit is only $10,000. Builders faced with high land costs, therefore, generally will build more dense housing. When this occurs, the effect of high land costs on home prices and rents is reduced.\nLittle Increase in Housing Densities in Coastal Metros. While developers typically respond to high land costs by building more dense housing, this response appears to be somewhat limited in most of California’s coastal metros. As a result, high land costs in these areas have translated more directly into higher housing costs. We examined U.S. Census data to compare changes in housing densities during the 2000s in California’s coastal metros to changes in metros elsewhere in the country. Our initial review of California’s coastal metros found that housing densities rose significantly faster in San Francisco than the other California coastal metros, which is unsurprising given that San Francisco’s land prices are higher than just about anywhere else in the U.S. Because San Francisco appeared to be exceptional, we focused the rest of our review on California’s other coastal metros. We compared changes in density in these other California coastal metros with metros that have land prices and existing housing densities similar to those found on California’s coast. We selected Boston, Las Vegas, Miami, Seattle, and Washington D.C. as our comparison group of metros. Our review found that, during the 2000s, the housing density of a typical neighborhood in California’s coastal metros rose by 4 percent. This increase in density was considerably less than the 11 percent average increase in our comparison group. Furthermore, we estimate that the new housing built in these comparison metros was about 40 percent more dense than housing built in California’s coastal metros. New housing in the comparison metros had an average density of about 14 units per acre, compared with about ten units per acre in California’s coastal metros.\nBuilding Costs Increase Housing Costs\nBuilding Costs Are Higher in California. Aside from the cost of land, three factors determine developers’ cost to build housing: labor, materials, and government fees. All three of these components are higher in California than in the rest of the country. Construction labor is about 20 percent more expensive in California metros than in the rest of the country. California’s building codes and standards also are considered more comprehensive and prescriptive, often requiring more expensive materials and labor. For example, the state requires builders to use higher quality building materials—such as windows, insulation, and heating and cooling systems—to achieve certain energy efficiency goals. Additionally, development fees—charges levied on builders as a condition of development—are higher in California than the rest of the country. A 2012 national survey found that the average development fee levied by California local governments (excluding water–related fees) was just over $22,000 per single–family home compared with about $6,000 per single–family home in the rest of the country. (This survey reflects school facilities fees imposed during this period and not the higher so–called “Level 3” fees that school districts may impose in the future if the State Allocation Board makes certain declarations about the availability of school construction funds.) Altogether, the cost of building a typical single–family home in California’s metros likely is between $50,000 and $75,000 higher than in the rest of the country.\nEffect of Building Costs on Prices and Rents Varies Across Regions of the State. Higher building costs contribute to higher housing costs throughout the state. The relationship between building costs and prices and rents, however, differs across inland and coastal areas of the state. In places where housing is relatively abundant, such as much of inland California, building costs generally determine housing costs. This is because landlords and home sellers compete for tenants and homebuyers. This competition benefits renters and prospective homebuyers by depressing prices and rents, keeping them close to building costs. In these types of housing markets, building costs account for the vast majority of home prices. In two major inland metros—Riverside–San Bernardino and Sacramento—building costs account for over fourth–fifths of home prices. In contrast, in coastal California, the opposite is true. Renters and home buyers compete for a limited number of apartments and homes, bidding up prices far in excess of building costs. Building costs account for around one–third of home prices in California’s coastal metros. Under these circumstances, as Figure 6 shows, building costs explain only a small portion of growth in housing costs. Instead, increasing competition for limited housing is the primary driver of housing cost growth in coastal California.\nWhy DO Coastal Areas Not Build Enough Housing?\nAs we discussed in the last section, California’s home prices and rents have risen because housing developers in California’s coastal areas have not responded to economic signals to increase the supply of housing and build housing at higher densities. A collection of factors inhibit developers from doing so. The most significant factors are:\n- Community Resistance to New Housing. Local communities make most decisions about housing development. Because of the importance of cities and counties in determining development patterns, how local residents feel about new housing is important. When residents are concerned about new housing, they can use the community’s land use authority to slow or stop housing from being built or require it to be built at lower densities.\n- Environmental Reviews Can Be Used to Stop or Limit Housing Development. The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires local governments to conduct a detailed review of the potential environmental effects of new housing construction (and most other types of development) prior to approving it. The information in these reports sometimes results in the city or county denying proposals to develop housing or approving fewer housing units than the developer proposed. In addition, CEQA’s complicated procedural requirements give development opponents significant opportunities to continue challenging housing projects after local governments have approved them.\n- Local Finance Structure Favors Nonresidential Development. California’s local government finance structure typically gives cities and counties greater fiscal incentives to approve nonresidential development or lower density housing development. Consequently, many cities and counties have oriented their land use planning and approval processes disproportionately towards these types of developments.\n- Limited Vacant Developable Land. Vacant land suitable for development in California coastal metros is extremely limited. This scarcity of land makes it more difficult for developers to find sites to build new housing.\nWe discuss these factors in more detail below.\nCommunity Resistance Is Heightened\nLocal Communities Make Most Decisions About New Housing. Cities and counties generally decide when, where, and to what extent housing development will occur (cities make these decisions within their boundaries and counties in unincorporated areas). Local zoning laws and building codes specify where housing may be built, as well as its density, quality, and style. Housing developers are required to obtain building permits from city and county planning departments and typically must gain approval from local planning commissions and city councils or county boards of supervisors. Cities and counties also prepare General Plans that shape their communities’ long–term development patterns.\nLocal Resident Concerns About New Housing Are Common Throughout the U.S. In general, many potential or perceived downsides of new housing accrue to existing residents, while many of the benefits of new housing accrue to future residents. As a result, existing residents sometimes take steps to slow or stop development.\nThere are many possible reasons residents may be hesitant about new housing. Some residents may see new housing as a threat to their financial wellbeing. For many homeowners, their home is their most significant financial investment. Existing homeowners, therefore, may be inclined to limit new housing because they fear it will reduce the values of the homes.\nResidents also may feel that new housing reduces their nonfinancial wellbeing. Many people, as they become accustomed to their lifestyle and the character of their neighborhood, naturally are hesitant about change and future unknowns. It is unsurprising then that they would be concerned about adding new housing to their community because it presents uncertainty and possibilities of change. Expanded development can strain existing infrastructure—such as streets and roads, schools, and parks—requiring residents to change the way they use these public goods. For example, new development may increase traffic on existing streets and roads, forcing some residents who commute via car to take public transportation instead. Strains on existing infrastructure also may require state and local governments to make new investments in infrastructure to expand capacity. New housing also can alter the character of a community, shifting it from a rural to an urban setting or from a traditional single–family home neighborhood to a neighborhood with a mix of densities and land uses. In addition, new housing can place strains on natural and environmental resources, in some instances making it more difficult to ensure adequate air and water quality or to protect natural ecosystems.\nOpposition to New Housing Appears to Be Heightened on the California Coast. Hesitance about new housing can lead residents to pressure local officials to use their land use authority to slow or block new development or may result in residents directly intervening in land use decisions via the initiative and referendum process. Compared with the rest of the country, these types of activities appear to occur more often in California’s coastal communities, suggesting that community opposition to housing is heightened in these areas.\nMany Coastal Communities Have Growth Controls. Over two–thirds of cities and counties in California’s coastal metros have adopted policies (known as growth controls) explicitly aimed at limiting housing growth. Many policies directly limit growth—for example, by capping the number of new homes that may be built in a given year or limiting building heights and densities. Other policies indirectly limit growth—for example, by requiring a supermajority of local boards to approve housing projects. Research has found that these policies have been effective at limiting growth and consequently increasing housing costs. One study of growth controls enacted by California cities found that each additional growth control policy a community added was associated with a 3 percent to 5 percent increase in home prices.\nProject Reviews Along Coast Often Are Slow and Cumbersome. Cities and counties often require housing projects to go through multiple layers of review prior to approval. For example, a project may require independent review by a building department, health department, fire department, planning commission, and city council. Each layer of review can increase project approval time. Additional complexity in review processes also creates avenues for concerned residents to slow building or reduce its size and scope, as the story in the nearby box shows. One survey of city and county officials nationwide suggests that communities in California’s coastal metros take about two and a half months longer, on average, to issue a building permit than in a typical California inland community or the typical U.S. metro (seven months compared to four and a half months). Divergence from the rest of the country was more significant in some communities—for example, typical approval time was over a year in San Francisco and over eight months in the City of Los Angeles. If a project required a change in local zoning laws—as is common among large projects—approval time was much longer. The average time to approve a rezoning was just under a year in California’s coastal metros, about three months longer than in a typical California inland community or a typical U.S. metro. Researchers have linked additional review time to higher housing costs. A study of jurisdictions in the Bay Area found that each additional layer of independent review was associated with a 4 percent increase in a jurisdiction’s home prices.\nCommunity Challenged Recent Housing Project in Southern California\nThe story of a housing project in an expensive area of Southern California—according to various media reports—shows the potential effects of community resistance on housing development. In 2008, a Southern California local government approved construction of a condo tower in its jurisdiction. Following the approval, a local homeowner’s association filed a lawsuit attempting to overturn the approval on grounds that the project was too far out of compliance with the city’s land use standards. During the lawsuit, which lasted around two years, the developer defaulted on its loan for the project site and plans for development were abandoned. In 2011, a second developer purchased the project site and continued efforts to build a condo tower. The project was completed in 2014. However, in late 2014, in response to a second lawsuit from the local homeowner’s association, a judge ruled the project’s building permits were invalid because the developers had failed to preserve a historical building on the project site. As a result, some households were prevented from moving into the completed condos. At the time this report was prepared (early 2015), this issue has not been resolved.\nLocal Ballot Measures on Coast Have Limited Development. Many significant land use decisions in California’s coastal communities are made by voters. More often than not, voters in California’s coastal communities vote to limit housing development when given the option. Our review of local elections data between 1995–2011 found that voters in California’s coastal metros took a position that limited housing growth—either by voting “yes” for a measure constraining growth or voting “no” for a measure that would allow growth—about 55 percent of the time. On average, coastal communities as a whole approved five measures per year limiting housing growth (or rejected measures allowing new building). While most major local jurisdictions throughout the country have some form of an initiative and referendum process, California’s high degree of voter involvement in land use decisions appears to be unique. One review of election results across the country during the November 2000 election found that just under half of all measures related to land use planning and growth management were in California.\nWhy Is Community Resistance to New Housing Heightened on California Coast? A collection of factors come together on the California coast to create a particularly heightened level of community resistance to new housing. High demand to live on California’s coast results in constant pressure for additional housing. At the same time, residents of California’s coast have much at stake in decisions about housing growth, as their communities have very high home values and desirable natural amenities. As a result, residents often push back against proposals for new housing. In addition, there is very little vacant land for new housing, meaning that development often takes the form of redevelopment in established neighborhoods. Redevelopment changes these neighborhoods, creating additional concerns for existing residents.\nCEQA Can Be Used to Delay or Reduce Building Activity\nCEQA Requires Environmental Review for New Housing. CEQA was enacted in 1970 in order to ensure that state and local agencies consider the environmental impact of their decisions when approving a public or private project. Under CEQA, before approving new housing (or other development), cities and counties usually must conduct a preliminary analysis to determine whether a project may have significant adverse environmental impacts. If it is determined that a project might create significant impacts, then an environmental impact report (EIR) must be prepared. An EIR provides detailed information about a project’s likely effect on the environment, considers ways to mitigate significant adverse environmental effects, and examines alternatives to the project. Where an EIR finds that a project will have significant adverse environmental impacts, a city or county is prohibited from approving the project unless one of the following two conditions is met: (1) the project developer makes modifications that substantially lessen the adverse environmental effects or (2) the city or county finds that economic or other project benefits override the adverse environmental effects. This level of environmental review for private housing development is uncommon among U.S. states. Only four other states have comparable requirements.\nCEQA Can Be Used to Reduce New Housing Development. The CEQA process can provide valuable information to decision makers and help to avoid unnecessary environmental impacts. The CEQA review process also provides many opportunities for opponents to raise concerns regarding a project’s potential effects on a wide array of matters, including parking, traffic, air and water quality, endangered species, and historical site preservation. A project cannot move forward until all concerns are addressed, either through mitigation or with a determination by elected officials that benefits of the project outweigh the costs. In addition, after a local governing board approves a project, opponents may file a lawsuit challenging the validity of the CEQA review. As a result of these factors, CEQA review can be time consuming for developers. Our review of CEQA documents submitted to the state by California’s ten largest cites between 2004–2013 indicates that local agencies took, on average, around two and a half years to approve housing projects that required an EIR. The CEQA process also, in some cases, results in developers reducing the size and scope of a project in response to concerns discovered during the review process.\nLimited Local Government Fiscal Incentive to Approve Housing Development\nLocal Governments Weigh Fiscal Impacts of Land Use Decisions. When property is developed, communities usually:\n- Receive Increased Tax Revenues. Many developments, for example, generate increased property and/or sales tax revenues for the communities in which they are located.\n- Face Increased Demand for Public Services and Infrastructure. For example, developments can trigger increased demand for local governments to provide police and fire services to new residents or to expand streets and roads to accommodate increased vehicle traffic.\nBecause different types of developments yield different amounts of tax revenues and service demands, local governments throughout the nation commonly examine these fiscal effects when considering new developments or planning for future development. As a matter of fiscal prudence, development that does not generate sufficient revenues to fund a local government’s new costs often is revised or rejected.\nCalifornia Communities Often Benefit More From Commercial Development. In California, cities and counties typically find that commercial developments—particularly major retail establishments, auto malls, restaurants, and hotels—yield the highest net fiscal benefits. This is because the increased sales and hotel tax revenue that a city (or, in the case of a development in an unincorporated area, the county) receives from these developments often more than offsets the local government’s costs to provide them public services. As a result, cities and counties often encourage these types of commercial developments to locate within their jurisdictions—for example by zoning large sections of land for these purposes and by offering subsidies or other benefits to the prospective business owners.\nIn contrast, many California cities and counties find that housing developments lead to more local costs than offsetting tax revenues. This is because these properties do not produce sales or hotel tax revenues directly and the state’s cities and counties typically receive only a small portion of the revenue collected from the property tax. In addition, lower–density luxury housing often “pencils out” more favorably from a local government standpoint than higher–density moderate cost housing. This is because the luxury housing generates higher levels of property tax revenues per new resident.\nNot surprisingly given these incentives, many cities and counties have oriented their land use planning and approval process disproportionately towards the development of commercial establishments and away from higher–density multifamily housing.\nLimited Developable Land\nTopography Limits Developable Land. Topography is the primary constraint on developable land in California’s coastal metros. Just under two–thirds of the area surrounding the urban centers on California’s coast is undevelopable due to mountains, hills, ocean, and other water. This compares to less than a quarter of land lost due to topography in a typical U.S. metro.\nMore Extensive Development Has Left Limited Vacant Land. Another constraint on development in California’s coastal metros is the extent to which land already has been developed. Land in the center of California’s major metros (defined as land within a 25 mile radius of the city hall of the metro’s largest city) contains housing built at densities similar to metros in the rest of the country. By comparison, land in the outlying areas of California coastal metros (land beyond the 25 mile radius) has housing at about twice the density as outlying areas in metros elsewhere in the country (four housing units per acre in California versus about two units per acre elsewhere in the country). More development in outlying areas typically leaves less vacant land for future development.\nRedeveloping Land Possible, but More Difficult and Expensive. Overall, one survey of land in California’s urban areas conducted in 2006 found that less than 1 percent of land in California’s coastal urban areas was developable and vacant. Limited vacant land, however, does not mean that development must cease. Previously developed but abandoned or underutilized parcels can be redeveloped. Older, lower–density housing can be replaced with new higher–density housing. These types of redevelopment activities can yield increased housing supply even in areas where little or no vacant land exists. Redevelopment, however, often is more cumbersome and expensive than development on vacant land. Developers must demolish old buildings and often are required to address environmental pollutants and toxic substances leftover from previous uses. New construction, therefore, is likely to proceed at a slower pace where land must be redeveloped.\nCommunity Decisions Can Exacerbate Land Scarcity. City and county land use policies can alleviate pressures created by limited vacant land by encouraging redevelopment and allowing developers to build more housing on each parcel. In many California communities, however, for reasons discussed earlier the opposite is true. Zoning laws often require developers to build housing at densities that are common elsewhere in the community, preventing developers from building at higher densities to counter high land costs. In addition, local communities sometimes pressure developers to reduce a project’s planned density during approval processes. Cities and counties also can magnify the effect of scarce land on housing costs by choosing to allocate a large share of available land to nonhousing uses, such as retail and hotel development.\nHow Big Is California’s Housing Shortage?\nIn recent decades, California has built new housing at a slower rate than the rest of the country and much of this new housing has been built in relatively underdeveloped inland areas. As a result, California’s supply of housing has not kept pace with demand to live in the state and housing costs have grown faster than the rest of the country. To give the Legislature an estimate of the magnitude of this housing shortfall, we developed a quantitative model of California’s housing market. This section begins with a description of this model and its findings and then assesses the likelihood of similar–sized housing shortfalls continuing in the future.\nEstimating California’s 1980–2010 Housing Shortage\nOur Model. As described more fully in this report’s technical appendix, our model uses standard statistical tools to examine housing price and supply changes in major metropolitan counties throughout the United States and control for various factors. A key element of our model is its ability to estimate the number of housing units that needed to be built to satisfy demand and keep housing prices within certain ranges. We used the model to estimate the amount of housing that—had it been built between 1980 and 2010—would have kept California’s median housing price from growing faster than the nation’s. Under this approach, California’s median housing prices still would have grown between 1980 and 2010, but the rate of growth would have been slower and comparable to that in the rest of the country. Under this housing supply scenario, California’s housing prices would have been 80 percent higher than the U.S. median in 2010, instead of reaching twice the U.S. median (as actually occurred).\nKey Findings. As we discuss further below, our model estimates that keeping California home prices from growing faster than the nation between 1980 and 2010 would have required the state to have:\n- Built substantially more new housing—in the range of 70,000 to 110,000 additional units each year.\n- Shifted more home building to coastal areas.\n- Built denser housing, concentrated in central cities.\nMore Housing in Total. Between 1980 and 2010, California’s major metros added about 120,000 new housing units each year. Our analysis suggests that between 190,000 units per year and 230,000 units per year were needed to keep California’s housing cost growth in line with cost escalations elsewhere in the U.S. (Our midpoint estimate—which represents our single best guess at California’s housing need—is slightly above 210,000 units per year. For the remainder of this section, we discuss our midpoint estimates.) Figure 7 shows our estimate of additional housing construction needed in each of the past three decades. These statewide estimates, however, mask significant variation across regions of the state, as well as across cities within those regions.\nMore Building on Coast, Less Inland. Our estimates suggest that, to contain price growth, the geographical distribution of new housing over the past three decades needed to be different, with significantly more building in coastal areas and somewhat less building in inland areas. Figure 7 compares actual home building in California’s largest counties between 1980 and 2010 to the levels of building that we estimate would have kept home price growth in line with the rest of the country. As Figure 8 shows, most of California’s coastal counties needed to build three times as much (or more) housing as they did, while inland counties built more housing than our estimates suggest was needed to contain price growth.\nMore Building in Central Cities, Less in Outlying Areas. As we discussed above, insufficient housing was built in California’s coastal counties, causing demand to spill over into inland areas. A similar situation appears to have occurred within the coastal counties. Insufficient housing was built in the central cities of coastal counties to satisfy demand for housing, driving development into suburban and rural areas. As Figure 9 shows, between 1980 and 2010, home prices in most of California’s largest cities grew faster than home prices in surrounding areas within the same county. In general, because unmet demand results in competition for housing and rising costs, home prices and rents are highest where unmet demand is greatest. These price trends, therefore, suggest that unmet demand for housing is greater in central cities relative to surrounding areas. More housing development was needed in central cities relative to surrounding areas to contain growth in housing costs.\nDenser Housing. Much of the buildable land in California’s coastal metros has been developed. Because of this, adding more housing to these metros would have required housing to be built more densely. Figure 10 shows our estimates of how dense housing would be in California’s coastal metros if they had grown over the last 30 years at the rate necessary to keep their prices in line with the rest of the country. Housing densities in many coastal counties would be more than two–thirds higher under the LAO growth scenario than they are today. Despite these sizeable increases, housing densities in California’s coastal metros under our growth scenario would not be unprecedented. As Figure 10 shows, there are other metropolitan counties throughout the country that currently are as dense as California’s coastal metros would be under our growth scenario.\nFigure 10\nBuilding More Housing in Coastal Metros Would Require Denser Development\nHousing Density in a Typical Neighborhood in California Counties, 2010\n|\nActual\n|\nLAO Growth Scenarioa\n|\nCounties Similar to LAO Growth Scenario\n|\n|\nOrange\n|\n|\n|\n|\n4 units per acre (typical homes)\n|\n5 units per acre (typical homes)\n|\nCook County (including Chicago), Illinois Denver, Colorado\n|\n|\nLos Angeles, Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara\n|\n|\n|\n4 to 5 units per acre (typical homes)\n|\n7 to 9 units per acre (small lot homes and duplexes)\n|\nWashington D.C. Baltimore, Maryland\n|\n|\nSan Francisco\n|\n|\n|\n|\n18 units per acre (two to three story townhomes)\n|\n35 to 40 units per acre (midrise apartments and condos)\n|\nBrooklyn, New YorkBronx, New York\n|\nMore Housing Would Mean More Californians. If California had added 210,000 new housing units each year over the past three decades (as opposed to 120,000), California’s population would be much greater than it is today. We estimate that around 7 million additional people would be living in California. In some areas, particularly the Bay Area, population increases would be dramatic. For example, San Francisco’s population would be more than twice as large (1.7 million people versus around 800,000). In other areas of the state, where significant housing development occurred due to spillover demand in the state’s coastal metros, population would likely be about what it is today or potentially smaller.\nWhat Does This Estimate Tell Us About the Future?\nAs we have discussed, a collection of barriers have prevented California’s housing developers from responding to high demand to live on California’s coast by building more housing there. Our analysis in this section suggests that these barriers have created a major disconnect between the demand for housing and its supply. Looking forward, there are many reasons to think this dynamic will continue. Many of the primary factors that make California desirable—moderate weather, natural beauty, and coastal proximity of its major metros—are ongoing. At the same time, we see no signs that coastal community resistance to new housing construction is abating. In addition, many state and local policies that have slowed or stopped development in recent decades remain in effect today. We therefore think that, in the absence of major policy changes, California’s trend of rapidly rising housing costs is very likely to continue in the future. Our analysis suggests that building substantially more housing in coastal urban areas—possibly as much as 100,000 additional units each year—could prevent California’s housing costs from continuing to grow faster than the U.S. In our view, this major finding that demand for housing in California substantially exceeds supply should inform discussions and decision making regarding state and local government housing policies.\nWe do, however, recognize that any attempt to estimate the state’s future housing needs faces significant uncertainties. Unforeseeable changes in demographics, economic conditions, or technology could shift dramatically the dynamics of California’s housing markets. Readers, therefore, should focus less on our specific estimates and more on the simple story they tell: to contain rising housing costs, California would have to build significant more housing, especially in coastal urban areas.\nWhat Are the Consequences of California’s Expensive Housing?\nHousing costs are the largest component of most households’ spending. Because housing is such a large financial consideration, households make careful decisions about the location, cost, and amenities of their home. Faced with high home prices and rents, California households must decide: how much income can they spend on housing (and therefore what must they consume less of); where can they find housing of this sort; and how far is this housing from work, school, and local amenities? Each household finds its unique answers to these questions, typically responding to high housing costs with a combination of trade–offs. In the following section, we review five significant trade–offs households make when faced with high housing costs. These include: (1) spending a larger share of income on housing, (2) postponing or foregoing homeownership, (3) living in more crowded housing, (4) commuting further to work each day, or (5) sometimes, choosing to work and live elsewhere. We also discuss how these serious trade–offs affect the state’s economy.\nHouseholds Spend More of Their Income on Housing\nHousing Costs Are a Major Consideration for Most Households. Housing costs are the largest component of most household’s spending each month. For homeowners, these costs include monthly principal and interests payments; property taxes and homeowner’s insurance; and household utilities like water, gas, and electricity. For renters, housing costs are their monthly rent and any utilities the tenant pays. On average, American households spend about one–quarter of their gross monthly income on housing. (More information on this data is available in the box below.)\nHow Do We Calculate These Figures?\nAnalysis Based on Responses to the American Community Survey. The data in this section are from individual and household responses to the Census Bureau’s 2013 American Community Survey, which recently replaced the long–form decennial census. The survey asks a sample of all households detailed questions about their finances, employment, demographics, location, and housing characteristics.\nWhat Is Household Income? In the American Community Survey, household income is the total of incomes earned by each member of the household who is at least 16 years old. Income includes wages and salaries; business income; interest; public assistance payments; Supplemental Security Income; and social security and other retirement, disability, or survivor income. It does not include capital gains income, money from the sale of a property, gifts, lump–sum inheritances, or money that was borrowed during the year.\nWhat Are Housing Costs? For owners, monthly housing costs include principal and interest payments on their mortgage(s); homeowner’s fire, hazard, or flood insurance; property taxes; utilities (electricity, gas, water, and sewer) and fuel costs; as well as monthly condominium fees or mobile home costs when applicable. For renters, monthly housing costs include what they pay for rent and any additional utilities or fuel costs in addition to their rent payments that are not paid by the landlord on behalf of the tenant. Household rent payments are recorded as rent paid, even if rent is paid by someone that does not reside in the household—a situation that could occur, for example, if a university student’s rent was being paid in full or in part by his or her parents.\nDespite Relatively Higher Incomes, Californians Devote Larger Share to Housing. Median household income in California is about $9,000 more annually than the national median. Median California housing costs, however, are about $5,300 greater as well. For most California households, therefore, higher housing costs consume a large portion of their higher income. Specifically, the median California household spends about 27 percent of their monthly income on housing. The median household in the rest of the country, on the other hand, spends about 23 percent. This above–average trend exists throughout California. As shown in Figure 11, households in each of the state’s major metros spend an above–average share of their income on housing. In the state’s largest metro, Los Angeles, the average household spends 30 percent of their income on housing, 7 percent more than the national average.\nThe figures discussed above are median housing costs as a share of income; that is, the amount of income spent on housing where one–half of households spend a smaller share and one–half spend a larger share. In this way, they best reflect the typical household’s experience. For other types of households, however, differences between Californians and the rest of the country may be more or less pronounced.\nLow–Income Californians Spend Greater Share of Income on Housing. Households with low incomes spend a smaller amount of money each month on housing than do households with higher incomes. Lower–income households nevertheless spend a much larger share of their total income on housing, leaving fewer resources leftover for other spending and savings priorities. As shown in Figure 12, California households in the bottom quarter of the income distribution—the poorest 25 percent of households—report spending four times more of their income (67 percent, on average) than households in the top quarter of the income distribution (16 percent, on average).\nGap Between California and U.S. Largest for Low–Income Households. The difference between what California households spend and what U.S. households typically spend—a difference that is the byproduct of the state’s high housing costs—is largest for low–income households and smallest for upper–income households. As shown in Figure 12, California households with incomes in the bottom quartile report spending 67 percent of their income on housing, about 11 percent more than low–income households elsewhere. This “gap” persists across most income groups but becomes smaller as income increases. For higher–income households, as shown in the figure, California households and households in other areas spend a similar, much smaller, share of their income on housing. These findings suggest that California’s high housing costs are particularly challenging for the state’s low–income households.\nRenters Spend a Much Larger Share of Income on Housing. Nationwide, renter households spend a significantly larger share of their income on housing. The median renter spends about 30 percent of his or her income on housing, whereas the median homeowner spends 20 percent. Primarily, this occurs because renter households have notably lower incomes, on average, than owner households. In addition to generally lower income levels, renters spend more on housing, on average, because a portion of homeowners have owned their homes for many years and therefore have very low monthly mortgage costs or no mortgage costs whatsoever.\nLow–Income Households That Spend More on Housing Spend Less on Essentials. In high cost areas, households typically spend a larger share of their income on housing. As a result, households have less money available for other types of spending. For households with above–average incomes, higher housing costs may mean they spend less on other items, but these households typically have sufficient resources to purchase regular household necessities. For low–income households, though, high housing costs cut into spending considered more necessary. According to Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies, low–income households who spent more than half of their income on housing spent 39 percent less on food than other low–income households that spent less than half their income on housing.\nHigh Housing Costs Contribute to Poverty in California. The federal government each year calculates what share of each state’s population lives in poverty. Typically, poverty is calculated by the Official Poverty Measure, which defines a family as poor if their pretax cash income is less than a poverty threshold that is standard across the nation. Based on this measure, California’s poverty rate is slightly higher than the rest of the United States, as shown in Figure 13. The federal government also reports poverty levels using an alternative measure, the so–called Supplemental Poverty Measure, which adjusts poverty thresholds based on local costs of living. Primarily because of California’s high housing costs, the state’s alternative poverty level is 23.4 percent, the highest in the nation and almost 9 percentage points higher than average.\nHigh Housing Costs May Make Personal Finances More Fragile. One byproduct of spending a large share of one’s income on housing is that personal finances may be more fragile—meaning a smaller share of a household’s income is available for nonhousing goods and services, including savings. As a result, these households may find it more difficult to accommodate a drop in household income because they have a smaller amount of nonhousing disposable income and likely have smaller available savings.\nFewer Households Own Their Homes\nHomeownership Helps Households Build Wealth. The federal government has actively promoted homeownership since it restructured the housing finance system during the Great Depression. As a result, beginning in 1940s, the U.S. homeownership rate rose steadily and substantially, peaking at 70 percent just before the recent housing crisis. (Since then, it has fallen 64 percent, a low not seen since the 1990s.) Homeownership helps households build wealth, requiring them to amass assets over time. Among homeowners, saving is automatic: every month, part of the mortgage payment reduces the total amount owed and thus becomes the homeowner’s equity. For renters, savings requires voluntarily foregoing near–term spending. Due to this and other economic factors, renter median net worth totaled $5,400 in 2013, a small fraction of the $195,400 median homeowner’s net worth. For many households in high housing cost areas, though, homeownership’s benefits remain out of reach, as higher home prices (relative to area incomes) mean fewer and fewer households can afford to become homeowners.\nCalifornia’s Homeownership Rate Among Lowest in Nation. About 64 percent of U.S. households own their homes, but only 54 percent of California households do. (Only New York State and Nevada have lower homeownership rates.) In areas with high housing prices, including those in California, homeownership tends to lag behind more affordable areas. Figure 14 shows that, across the country, metro areas where home prices are high relative to average income levels tend to have lower homeownership rates. Most of California’s major metros, and all of California’s coastal metros, fall into this category.\nHouseholds That Do Buy Purchase Later and Take on More Debt. An additional byproduct of higher home prices is that young people delay purchasing their first home, possibly because saving for a down payment takes longer or households are not able to generate qualifying income levels until later in their careers. According to National Association of Realtors data, the median first–time homebuyer in California in 2013 was 34 years old, three years older than the median first–time homebuyer nationwide.\nIn addition, households that are able to purchase a home typically take on more mortgage debt because home prices are higher here. Urban Institute data shows that the average California homeowner had $55,000 in mortgage debt outstanding as of 2013, about $17,000 more than the average U.S. homeowner ($38,000).\nHouseholds More Likely to Be Crowded\nWhat Is Crowded Housing? Housing experts measure crowding by comparing the number of people in a household to the number of rooms in their home, including bedrooms and common rooms but excluding bathrooms. Although several definitions exist, we consider a household crowded if there is more than one adult per room, counting two children as equivalent to one adult. Under this definition, a three room apartment (with a kitchen, living room, and one bedroom) is crowded if more than three adults live there. It is also considered crowded if more than two adults and two children live there. Researchers who study crowding report that it leads to a wide range of negative outcomes, which we describe below. Researcher find these outcomes even after they account for other socioeconomic factors that might affect well–being, like income and educational level.\nCrowded Housing Affects Well–Being and Educational Achievement. Individuals who live in crowded housing generally have worse educational and behavioral health outcomes than people that do not live in crowded housing. Among adults, crowding has been shown to increase stress and aggression, lead to social isolation, and weaken relationships between parents and their children. Crowding also has particularly notable effects on children. Researchers have found that children in crowded housing score lower on standardized math and reading exams. A lack of available and distraction–free studying space appears to affect educational achievement. Crowding may also result in sleep interruptions that affect mood and behavior. As a result, children in crowded housing also displayed more behavioral problems at school.\nLAO Analyses of Crowding. In our analysis, we examined the relationship between California’s high housing costs and overcrowding. Because California has many households types that commonly live in larger, multigenerational households (such as households with foreign–born members), we examined different household types separately, as shown in Figure 15. Specifically, in our first analysis, we calculated crowding rates—the share of households that are crowded—for different types of households. We do this for California and the rest of the U.S. Then, we examined how likely each of these household types is to be crowded based on the cost of housing in their metro.\nCalifornia Households Four Times More Likely to Live in Crowded Housing. Certain household types are more likely than average to live in crowded housing, such as households headed by foreign–born adults, Hispanics, and those with children. California has a higher share of these household types than the rest of the U.S. Because of this, we would expect California to have a higher crowding rate. A review of the data, however, shows that California’s crowding rate is higher than one would expect based solely on its larger share of these household types. This is because crowding rates for each household type (including those most likely to live in crowded housing) are higher in California than they are elsewhere. As a result, California’s overall crowding rate is four times higher than the U.S. average, partly due to demographics and partly to other factors, including higher housing costs, as discussed below.\nCrowding Appears Associated With High Housing Costs. Determining whether housing costs affect crowding is challenging because areas with the high housing costs tend to have fewer households types that are likely to be crowded. Using statistical analysis, however, we found that living in a high housing cost area is associated with a higher likelihood of living in crowded housing, after accounting for other factors that also affect crowding rates. Figure 16 shows that the likelihood of being crowded increases when the area’s median home price increases (moving from left to right). For example, the average household’s likelihood of being crowded in a metro with average home prices (about $440,000) is about 3 percent, but the same household’s likelihood of being crowded increases more than threefold—to 10 percent—if they live in an expensive metro with median home prices of $900,000.\nHouseholds Commute Further to Work\nEach Household Makes Its Own Decisions About Commuting. Housing’s geographic location has lasting and important consequences. Ideally, each household could choose housing in their preferred neighborhood, near good schools and welcoming amenities, with only a short work commute. In practice, though, not only are ideal locations relatively sparse, those that do exist are desirable and therefore expensive. In response, households balance their preferences and resources, selecting trade–offs among housing costs, commute times, and neighborhood characteristics.\nComplex Metro Characteristics Influence Commute Times. Each major metro area in the country has unique characteristics that influence whether it has above– or below–average commute times. Most factors are straightforward—for instance, natural geography, existing transportation infrastructure and the availability of public transit, and the spatial distribution of jobs relative to that of housing. Other factors are less straightforward. A metro’s land area and its density affect commute times, but in complex ways. For example, up to a point, commute times generally increase as areas become denser because transportation options become more congested. After densities reach a certain level, however, the viability of public transportation options improves. In some circumstances, this can relieve pressure on other transportation options and reduce average commute times.\nCalifornia’s Coastal Metros Have Long Commutes. In 2013, workers in large metros throughout the country spent, on average, 55 minutes commuting each day. Workers in California’s coastal metros averaged 60 minutes, about 10 percent more than the national average. Commute times in Los Angeles, the state’s largest metro, averaged 62 minutes, 12 percent longer than the U.S. average. San Francisco has the state’s longest average commutes—72 minutes per day—about 30 percent longer than the U.S. average.\nHow Might Housing Costs Affect Commute Times? The relationship between metropolitan characteristics, including its housing costs, and average commute times is complex. Assuming neighborhood characteristics and other preferences are unchanged, housing costs should decline as one moves further from job centers. This is because commuting involves monetary and nonmonetary costs that must be offset somehow. Neighborhood characteristics and preferences change across metropolitan areas, however, making the analysis of commute times and metro characteristics additionally complex. To find housing at a price they are willing to pay, households in more expensive metros might choose to live further from work than they would if housing were less expensive. This could lead average commute times to be longer in areas with higher housing costs. Not surprisingly, we found that metro areas with higher housing costs tend to have longer average commute times.\nDo High Housing Costs Lead to Longer Commutes? Our analysis found that many important factors have statistically significant effects on commute times. These include: whether the commuter drives, walks, or takes public transit to work; the metro’s land size, population, and density; the metro’s median income; and weather. After controlling for these factors—in essence isolating the effect of housing costs on commute times—a 10 percent increase in a metro’s median rent is associated with a 4.5 percent increase in individual commute times. The fact that California’s average commute times are only moderately above average (despite notably higher housing costs) suggest that other California–specific factors reduce average commute times. These factors may include weather conditions, widespread development and availability of freeway systems, and an above–average share of commuters who drive to work. (Driving commutes are generally fast, and therefore metros with higher shares of driving commuters tend to have shorter commute times.) Despite these mitigating factors, however, our analysis suggests that California’s high housing costs cause workers to live further from where they work, likely because reasonably priced housing options are unavailable in locations nearer to where they work.\nHousing Costs Influence Where Households Live and Work\nDecisions About Where to Live and Work Are Complex. Understanding how housing costs affect a household’s decision about where to live and work is challenging. This is because regional and state economies are complex and numerous interconnected factors influence housing costs (as well as other costs of living) and economic opportunities in these areas. Despite this complexity, economists and other researchers have identified ways that housing costs affect migration—and, in some instances, have attempted to quantify the magnitude of these effects. Below, we summarize the aspects of this work we believe are most helpful when considering how housing costs affect migration and the state’s economy.\nHigh Housing Costs Discourage People From Living in California. Housing costs are a significant driver of migration to and from California, and changes in the state’s housing costs (relative to other areas of the country) influence migration trends. The ratio of in–migration to out–migration, a measure of population flow, is lowest when California’s home prices are high relative to other places. On the other hand, this flow is highest when California housing becomes relatively more affordable compared to other states. Our analysis of these trends, which we discussed in the preceding section, suggests that about 7 million additional people would live in California if more housing had been built here and the state’s housing prices had therefore grown about as quickly as those in the rest of the country since 1980.\nHigh Housing Costs May Make it Difficult to Recruit Employees. For most businesses, labor costs are their largest operating cost. In areas with higher costs of living, businesses generally must pay employees higher wages because they require additional income to offset the cost of living differences. California’s cost of living is among the highest in the nation, largely because California’s housing costs are so high. As a result, businesses in California’s coastal metros may find it challenging (and expensive) to recruit or retain qualified employees. In a 2014 survey of more than 200 business executives conducted by the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, 72 percent of them cited “housing costs for employees” as the most important challenge facing Silicon Valley businesses. Employee recruitment and retention, closely related to housing costs, was the second most frequently identified challenge. Similarly, other important sectors of the state’s economy may find recruitment challenging and labor costs expensive. For example, some higher education institutions in high housing cost areas provide housing subsidies in order to recruit successfully top administrators and academic specialists. Stanford University recently announced plans to lease a 167–unit apartment complex for their staff and faculty, noting that providing housing helps them “compete to recruit the best faculty from other parts of the country, where they experience very different real estate markets.”\nHigh Housing Costs Mean Fewer Californians Work in State’s Most Productive Cities. In general, businesses and employees in large cities are more economically productive than those in other areas. (Economists use the term “agglomeration economies” to describe these areas. Agglomeration economies are areas where worker productivity increases as population density increases.) Higher productivity leads to more economic output per employee, and thus greater economic growth in the region. Under normal circumstances, these economic opportunities attract new workers from other areas. Historically, this has led to significant population growth in the state’s cities. However, in recent decades, high housing costs have slowed this trend. This is because the expected wage gains (from moving to a city) are not large enough for many prospective workers to make up for their higher housing costs. California’s major productive cities have therefore grown less quickly than they otherwise would.\nFewer Workers in State’s Most Productive Cities Hinders Economic Growth. The slowing flow of workers to productive cities likely has constrained economic growth because potential workers, unable to move to productive cities due to high housing costs, do not benefit from the productivity gains occurring in cities. If more workers lived in the state’s highly productive cities (and therefore reaped these cities’ productivity benefits), per capita economic activity in the state would be greater than it is today. Estimating the magnitude of this impact involves considerable uncertainty. Recent research, however, may provide a helpful guide as to this impact’s order of magnitude. Economists at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Chicago recently estimated that annual U.S. economic output—the total value of goods and services produced each year—is 13 percent lower today than it otherwise would be due to “increased constraints to housing supply in highly productive cities.”\nLooking Ahead: What Is Needed to Contain California’s High Housing Costs?\nCalifornia’s high housing costs present many difficult issues for policy makers, residents, and businesses to consider. On the one hand, California’s constraints on housing supply—the primary factor driving the state’s high housing costs—show no signs of abating. If California continues on its current path, the state’s housing costs will remain high and likely will continue to grow faster than the nation’s. This, in turn, will place substantial burdens on Californians—requiring them to spend more on housing, take on more debt, commute further to work, and live in crowded conditions. Growing housing costs also will place a drag on the state’s economy.\nOn the other hand, addressing California’s constraints on housing supply would be extremely challenging and involve major trade–offs. Though the exact number of new housing units California needs to build is uncertain, the general magnitude is enormous. On top of the 100,000 to 140,000 housing units California is currently expected to build, our analysis suggests that the state probably would have to build as many as 100,000 additional units annually—almost exclusively in its coastal communities—to seriously mitigate the state’s problems with housing affordability. Adding this many new homes, however, could place strains on the state’s infrastructure and natural resources and could alter the longstanding and prized character of California’s coastal communities. Facilitating this housing construction also would require the state to make changes to a broad range of policies that affect housing supply directly or indirectly—including many policies that have been fundamental tenets of California government for many years.\nDespite these challenges, California’s housing problems warrant attention from state leaders. These difficult issues could require years of legislative deliberation, including discussions with all major stakeholders: the administration, local governments, environmental groups, affordable housing developers and advocates, and housing policy experts. In its deliberations, we recommend that the Legislature:\n- Aim to Build More Housing in Coastal Cities, Densely. The greatest need for additional housing is in California’s coastal urban areas. We therefore recommend the Legislature focus on what changes are necessary to promote additional housing construction in these areas.\n- Put All Policy Options on the Table. Given the magnitude of the problem, the Legislature would need to take a comprehensive approach that addresses the problem from multiple angles and reexamines major policies. Major changes to local government land use authority, local finance, CEQA, and other major polices would be necessary to address California’s high housing costs.\n- Recognize Targeted Role of Affordable Housing Programs. These programs play an important role in assuring housing access for many Californians with unmet housing needs. We note, however, that the scale of these programs—even if greatly increased—could not meet the magnitude of new housing required that we identify in this report. Accordingly, we recommend the Legislature consider how targeted programs could supplement more private housing construction by assisting those with limited access to market rate housing, such as people experiencing homelessness, those with mental and/or physical health challenges, and those with very low incomes.\n- Understand That Some Factors Are Beyond Policy Makers’ Control. Much can be done by state and local governments to promote additional housing construction and therefore slow down growth in home prices and rents going forward. Some factors, however, such as high demand to live in the state and natural limitations on developable land, largely are beyond the control of policy makers. As a result, home prices and rents in California likely will remain above–average for the foreseeable future, even if public policies highly favorable to new housing construction were instituted that slowed future growth in housing costs.\nTechnical Appendix\nHow Did We Estimate California’s Need for Additional Housing?\nCalifornia’s housing costs have risen faster than the rest of the country for several decades. This is largely because the state has built too little housing to accommodate all of the households that would like to live here. In general, home prices and rents are determined by the interaction between demand for housing and its supply. Home prices and rents help balance the number of households looking for housing and the number of new housing units constructed. When the number of households looking for housing exceeds the number of units available, households compete for housing and prices and rents rise. High prices and rents, in turn, discourage some households from entering the market, bringing demand and supply into balance. Conversely, if construction of housing increases, more housing units are available and therefore competition among households is reduced, causing prices and rents to fall.\nHow Much Additional Housing Was Needed? Our analysis attempts to estimate the amount of additional housing needed to prevent California’s housing costs from growing faster than the rest of the country in recent decades. In approaching this issue, we first recognized that if California’s housing costs had grown only as fast as the rest of the country, home prices and rents would have been lower and more households would have desired to live here. To maintain these lower housing costs, additional housing would have been needed to be built to accommodate these new households. Therefore, to answer our question, we considered a similar one: if California’s home prices and rents had risen only as fast as the rest of the country during the past three decades, how many additional households would have wished to live here (and, consequently, how much additional housing construction would have been needed)?\nDeveloping a Model of Supply and Demand for Housing. To answer this question, we developed an econometric model to estimate the number of households that would demand to live in California at a range of home prices. Because demand for housing varies throughout California, we conducted our analysis at the county level. Our model attempts to estimate a county’s housing demand based on the county’s home prices, its neighboring counties’ home prices, and various other factors that also affect the desirability of a location—incomes, population levels and growth rates, unemployment rate, education levels, and weather. While most of our analysis centered around the relationship between housing demand and home prices, we also conducted a similar analysis using rents instead of home prices. Our analysis using rents yielded similar results.\nFor our dependent variable, we used ten–year growth in the number of housing units (both single–family and multifamily housing) from the U.S. Census, corresponding to housing growth in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.We also obtained data on home prices, incomes, population, and education levels from the U.S. Census. For each of these variables, we averaged the values at the beginning and end of each decade to obtain a decade average value. Data on unemployment rates was obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Weather data was obtained from the National Climatic Data Center.\nEstimating Our Model Presents Challenges. Empirically estimating our model of housing demand presented two major challenges. First, as we discussed above, home prices and construction levels are determined by the interaction of demand and supply. Home prices generally tend toward a level at which the number of households looking for new housing equals the number of new housing units constructed. In this way, home prices and building levels are set simultaneously. Similarly, demand for housing in one county and its neighbors (and consequently the prices for these homes) often are determined by common factors. For example, major regional shifts in employment can affect many counties simultaneously. As a result, traditional statistical techniques, such as ordinary least squares, would give inaccurate estimates of the relationship between demand and prices for housing in a county and neighboring counties. To estimate this relationship more accurately, we used two–stage least squares, instrumenting for both a county’s home prices and neighboring counties’ prices using factors that affect home prices by influencing the supply of housing. Specifically, we use: the county’s land area, a measure of topographical constraints to development, and construction labor wages. Changes in these supply factors can result in changes in home prices but typically are not clearly related to changes in housing demand, making them suitable instrumental variables to estimate our model. Data on land areas was obtained from the U.S. Census, while topographical constraints were taken from research conducted by economist Albert Saiz. Construction wage data was taken from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nOur second major challenge was a limited number of observations for California counties. Because of data limitations, our analysis was constrained to counties comprising metropolitan areas (metros) of 850,000 or more people—roughly the size of the state’s tenth largest metro, Bakersfield. With this limited number of observations, it was difficult to obtain precise estimates of our model’s parameters. We therefore expanded our dataset to include all U.S. counties comprising metros of 850,000 or more people, giving us over 1,000 observations. The inclusion of non–California counties, however, comes with a trade–off: we must assume that households’ demand for housing responds to home prices changes the same way in California as in the rest of the country. This is a potential limitation of our analysis.\nResults From Our Analysis. The results of our regression are shown in Figure A–1. As these results show, we found a strong and statistically significant relationship between a county’s housing demand and its home prices: when a county’s home prices increase 10 percent, demand for new housing (the number of new housing units demanded as a share of existing housing) decreases by around 8 percent. Similarly, we find a significant relationship between housing demand and neighboring counties’ home prices: when neighboring counties home prices increase by 10 percent, demand for new housing increases by about 2 percent.\nFigure A–1\nHousing Demand Regression Results\nDependent Variable: Ten–Year Growth in Housing Units\n|\nIndependent Variablea\n|\nCoefficient\n|\nStandard Error\n|\n|\nHome price\n|\n–0.83b\n|\n0.10\n|\n|\nAverage of neighboring counties’ home prices\n|\n0.16b\n|\n0.05\n|\nUsing Analysis to Estimate Number of Units Needed. The next step in our analysis was to use these findings to answer the question: how many additional units would California have needed to build in order for its home prices and rents to have risen only as fast as the rest of the country during the past three decades? To do this, we used the coefficient estimates in Figure A–1 to determine how much housing demand would change in California’s counties if home prices had grown only as fast as the rest of the country. The best way to illustrate these calculations is to walk through an example. We use San Francisco during the 1980s for this illustration. Our calculation proceeded in two main steps:\n- Step 1: Within County Price Changes. During the 1980s, home prices in the average major U.S. metro grew by 28 percent. In San Francisco, home prices increased 80 percent. If San Francisco’s home prices had grown 52 percentage points slower (equal to the national average), our regression results suggest that demand for new housing in San Francisco would have increased by 43 percent (–52 percent multiplied by –0.83, our estimated coefficient for within county home price changes).\n- Step 2: Neighboring County Price Changes. Similarly, home prices in counties neighboring San Francisco grew by 53 percent during the 1980s, compared to 33 percent for the rest of the country. If home price growth in San Francisco’s neighbors had been 20 percentage points lower (equal to the national average), our analysis suggests that demand for new housing in San Francisco would have decreased by 3 percent (–20 percent multiplied by 0.16, our estimated coefficient for neighboring county home price changes). Because of this, our calculation from step 1 must be adjusted. We therefore adjust downward our estimate from step 1 by 3 percentage points, arriving at a final estimate of 40 percent additional housing growth.\nAs is often true with econometric studies, our analysis is limited by several factors, including the availability and quality of data, potential misspecification of our model, and the inherent difficulty of drawing conclusions from nonexperimental data. Because of this, we recommend that elected leaders and residents focus less on our specific estimates and more on the overall story they tell (as discussed in the body of this report): to contain rising housing costs, California would have to build substantially more housing, especially in coastal urban areas.\nHow Do We Estimate How Housing Costs Affect a Household’s Likelihood of Crowding?\nOur analysis of state and national crowding trends is based on 2013 1–year American Community Survey microdata. Microdata are large data files that include individual–level responses to the survey questions. Using them, we can study household–level crowding conditions and how those conditions are affected by a metro area housing costs.\nA First Look at Crowding. Upon initial review of the data, we found that, throughout the country, renters, households with children, and households headed by first–generation individuals or Hispanic individuals are all more likely than average to live in crowded housing. Also, the likelihood of living in crowded housing is much higher for low–income households than for wealthier households. We also found that these types of households make up a larger share of all households in the state’s inland metro areas (where housing is inexpensive) than they do in the state’s coastal metros (where housing is expensive). As a result, comparing crowding rates at the metro level to housing costs at the metro level would inaccurately suggest that higher housing costs are associated with lower crowding rates and vice–versa. (Some element of this may actually occur, but only insofar as lower–income households move to less expensive parts of the state to avoid crowding.) A closer examination of household level data, however, shows that the opposite is true—higher housing costs are associated with higher crowding rates.\nDeveloping a Model to Investigate What Factors Lead to Crowding. To examine the relationship between households’ likelihood of crowding and housing costs, we developed a simple econometric model to estimate the probability of a household living in crowded housing. We use a probit regression analysis, which asks: how do various economic and demographic factors affect the probability of a household being crowded? This type of model holds constant each of the economic and demographic factors so that we are able to isolate them individually and assess how they impact crowding. For instance, we are able to ask the question: how much more likely is the statistically–mean California household to live in crowded housing if they moved from a low housing cost area of the state to a more expensive one (holding all of their other economic and demographic characteristics constant)? The results of the probit regression analysis are summarized in Figure A–2.\nFigure A–2\nCrowding Regression Results\nDependent Variable: Probability That a Household Resides in Crowded Housing\n|\nIndependent Variablea\n|\nCoefficient\n|\nStandard Error\n|\n|\nMetro area median home price (1,000s)\n|\n0.001b\n|\n0.000\n|\nInterpreting Our Findings. The coefficient estimates from probit analyses are not easily interpretable. To make these results easier to understand, we use the regression results to compare the probability of being crowded for the mean California household (as well as Hispanic–headed households and households with children) when metro area median home prices are low ($167,000, equal to the state’s least expensive metro), average ($433,000, the statewide average), and high ($934,000, equal to the state’s most expensive metro). The results from this analysis are included in Figure 16. These results show the probably of living in crowded housing increases as median home prices increase, and that this increase occurs for all household types.\nHow Do We Estimate How Housing Costs Affect Commute Times?\nWe also use responses from the 2013 one–year American Community Survey to review how housing costs affect commute times in different metro areas. For our analysis, we calculated each workers commute time by looking at all the individuals who commuted to work in that metro, and not just the individuals who live and work in that metro. In some cases, an individual may live outside a metro area and commute each day into a metro area for work. For our analysis, those individuals are included in that metro’s commute times. For example, many individuals commute from the Los Angeles metro into the Santa Ana–Anaheim metro (Orange County) and vice–versa.\nWhat Factors Affect Commute Times? Various metro area characteristics affect commute times for workers in that metro. These include physical and geographic factors, such as the metro’s land size, the number of people who live there (related to its density), and the share of land in the metro that is available for development. For example, metros with a large share of their area occupied by mountains or water tend to have longer commute times because these features may make transportation options more challenging. Other factors also affect a metro’s average commute times, such as the area’s median income and what share of the metro’s commuters drive, take public transportation, or walk.\nHow Do We Estimate How Housing Prices Affect Commute Times? We develop an econometric model to estimate how home prices and rents affect commute times. Similar to our other regressions, this model holds constant factors that affect commute times, allowing us to isolate the relationship between average housing prices and commute times in a metro. We developed several models, using both rents and home prices. We also tested commute times at the metro level and at the individual level. Our main model is shown and discussed in more detail below.\nInterpreting Results From Our Analysis. The results of our regression are shown in Figure A–3. As these results show, we found a strong and statistically significant relationship between individual commute times and several other factors, including metro average rent. (We used rents in this case, instead of home prices, though the choice of which price measure to use has little effect on the results of the analysis.) The coefficient for median rent, 0.45, suggests that a 10 percent increase in metro median rent is associated with a 4.5 percent increase in average commute time. Also, notably, the coefficient for California metros is significant and negative, suggesting that California’s metro areas have some factors (beyond housing costs, income, density, and commute type) that lowers overall commute times. We discuss earlier several possible explanations, including widespread development and availability of freeway systems throughout the state, which likely reduce commute times overall.\nFigure A–3\nCommuting Regression Results\nDependent Variable: Individual Commute Time, One Waya\n|\nIndependent Variablea\n|\nCoefficient\n|\nStandard Error\n|\n|\nMetro average rentb\n|\n0.45c\n|\n0.01\n|\nAcknowledgements\nOver the course of several months, we consulted with numerous individuals and organizations about housing in California. This report benefited greatly from these conversations. We know that they do not always agree with our findings or endorse our conclusions. We nevertheless gratefully acknowledge their willingness to discuss these topics with us, provide feedback, and share their valuable experience.\nWe consulted many local governments in the development of this report, including the California Association of Counties and the League of California Cities; the Cities of Mountain View, Santa Monica, Riverside, San Jose, and Yucaipa; and Marin and Sacramento Counties.\nWe also received significant guidance and feedback from academic economists and other housing experts, including experts from the Economic and Demographic Research Units at the California Department of Finance, the Public Policy Institute of California, and the Center for Real Estate Finance Research at New York University. Housing California was particularly helpful as we considered the role that affordable housing initiatives play within California’s broader housing market. The California Building Industry Association provided important information and context about building costs in California.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Housing Discrimination\nThe California Civil Rights Department (CRD) is responsible for enforcing state fair housing laws that make it illegal to discriminate against or harass someone because of a protected characteristic, such as their gender, race, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion. (For a complete list of protected characteristics, see the section below titled “Protected Characteristics”). The law also requires reasonable accommodations for disabilities and prohibits retaliation against someone for exercising their rights. The law applies to landlords, tenant screening companies, property management companies, real estate agents, home sellers, builders, mortgage lenders, housing authorities, and others. The law applies to all aspects of housing and housing-related services, such as renting, leasing, sales, new construction, mortgage lending, insurance, municipal services, shelters, advertising, and restrictive covenants. Additionally, it is unlawful for cities, counties, or any local government agency to make zoning, land-use decisions, or policies that discriminate based on a protected characteristic.\nWhat Discrimination Looks Like\nCalifornia’s Fair Employment and Housing Act (also known as FEHA) applies to most providers of housing and services related to housing such as landlords, tenant screening companies, real estate agents, home sellers, builders, mortgage lenders, and housing authorities. This law prohibits people or entities that provide housing from discriminating against or harassing tenants, homeowners, residents, their guests, housing or mortgage applicants, home buyers, and others.\nExamples of actions that could be discriminatory if based on a person’s protected characteristic:\n- Refusal to sell, rent, or lease rooms, apartments, mobile homes, condos, or houses\n- Refusal to negotiate for the sale, rental, or lease of housing\n- Informing someone that an apartment is not available for inspection, sale, or rental when it is in fact available\n- Denial of a home loan or homeowner’s insurance\n- Cancellation or termination of a sale or rental agreement\n- Refusal to permit, at a disabled tenant’s expense, reasonable modifications – such as adding a ramp, widening a doorway, or installing a safety bar in a shower – when necessary to accommodate a disability\n- Refusal to make reasonable accommodations in housing rules, policies, practices, or services where necessary to provide a disabled person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling\n- Rules that restrict only on families with children, such as a prohibition against children using an on-site pool or playing in common areas of an apartment complex\n- Refusing to rent to a tenant with a section 8 voucher.\n- Not complying with the requirements of a rental assistance or subsidy program (such as section 8) by refusing to complete required forms, sign documents, or allow inspections\n- Refusing to rent to anyone with a criminal history\n- Screening prospective tenants – including when done by a third-party such as a tenant screening company – in a way that discriminates based on a protected characteristic\n- Retaliation against someone because they filed a complaint with CRD, requested a reasonable accommodation for a disability, or otherwise tried to protect their rights to be free from housing discrimination\nCalifornia law protects individuals from illegal discrimination and harassment by housing providers based on certain protected characteristics, whether or not someone actually has that characteristic or is perceived to have it. The law also protects against discrimination and harassment that is based on more than one, or intersecting, characteristics. Finally, California law protects people from discrimination and harassment that is based on the protected characteristic of their family member, friend, roommate, or any other associate.\nProtected Characteristics\nProtected characteristics include::\n- Race\n- Color\n- Ancestry\n- National origin\n- Citizenship\n- Immigration status\n- Primary language\n- Religion\n- Disability (mental or physical)\n- Sex and gender\n- Sexual orientation\n- Gender Identity\n- Gender Expression\n- Genetic information\n- Marital status\n- Familial status (families with children under 18 or people who are pregnant)\n- Source of income (including the use of government rental assistance such as a Section 8 Housing Choice voucher)\n- Military or veteran status\n- Age\nFEHA also provides protections for people and circumstances related to protected characteristics, including:\n- the right to operate a licensed family childcare in a provider’s home\n- specific protections for people with criminal histories who are searching for housing\nFor more information, please see CRD’s Fair Housing Factsheet and Fair Housing Booklet\nAvailable Remedies\nState law provides for a variety of remedies for victims of housing discrimination, including:\n- Recovery of out-of-pocket losses\n- An injunction prohibiting the unlawful practice\n- Access to housing that the landlord denied you\n- Damages for emotional distress\n- Civil penalties or punitive damages\n- Attorney’s fees\nFAQ\nWhat types of housing are covered by the Fair Employment and Housing Act?\nThe Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) covers the sale, rental, or occupancy of most housing accommodations in California, including single-family homes, multi-family homes, condominiums, apartments, short-term rentals, mobile homes, subsidized housing, dormitories, sober living facilities, group homes, residential motels, emergency shelters, homeless shelters, shelters for survivors of domestic violence, recreational vehicles (RVs) used as a home, farmworker housing, and boats used as homes.\nWho must comply with the Fair Employment and Housing Act?\nMost people and entities that are housing providers or who provide services related to housing must comply with the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). This includes landlords, homeowners, apartment managers, real estate brokers, state or local governments, owners of short-term rentals, appraisers, tenant screening companies, homeowners associations, mortgage lending companies, and public housing authorities.\n- When an owner is occupying a home and is renting to one additional person, the owner may exclude applicants based on protected characteristics. However, the owner still cannot make, print, or publish discriminatory statements, notices, or advertisements.\n- When sharing a living area in a single dwelling, the owner or occupant may state or imply that the housing is available only to person of one sex.\n- Housing specifically for seniors may be limited based on age.\n- Under some circumstances, housing for homeless youth may be limited based on age.\nCan a housing provider refuse to rent to families with children?\nGenerally, housing providers cannot discriminate against families with children. This is called “familial status” discrimination and protections include:\n- Prohibiting landlords and other types of housing providers from refusing to rent to someone because their household includes children.\n- Requiring that admission and occupancy requirements be enforced the same for everyone, including families with children. For example, if a housing provider allows up to four people to live in a one-bedroom unit, they must allow a family of two parents and two children, or a mother or father with three children, to reside in the unit.\n- Prohibiting housing providers from having conditions or rules that discriminate against households with children, such as charging a higher security deposit to households with children or excluding children from playing in common areas open to other tenants.\nHowever, housing that has been specifically designed for senior citizens (persons 55 and older in some cases or 62 and older in others) can exclude people based on age, including families with children. To qualify as “senior housing,” a housing accommodation must meet specific legally defined requirements, which may include a minimum number of units, age-based residency limits, and design features.\nIs it legal to develop and market housing for seniors?\nYes, but only when the facility or community is:\n- Provided under any state or federal program that the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development has determined to be specifically designed and operated to assist elderly persons\n- Designed to meet the physical and social needs of senior citizens; or\n- A mobile home park that:\n- Is intended for, and solely occupied by, people aged 62 years or older; or\n- Is intended and operated for occupancy by people aged 55 years or older and that meets a set of requirements including: at least 80% of the occupied units are intended to be occupied by at least one person who is 55 or older, the park publishes and adheres to policies and procedures demonstrating the intent for occupancy by people 55 or older, and the park complies with HUD’s rules for verification of occupancy.\nWhat is the definition of a disability?\nThe Fair Employment and Housing Act defines a disability as a mental or physical impairment, or condition that limits a major life activity. Examples of major life activities include cooking, cleaning, bathing, working, paying bills, and shopping. For example, if a person has a mental health condition that makes it difficult to shop for groceries and clean their apartment, they would be considered to be disabled under California fair housing law.\nPeople that are perceived to have a disability (whether or not they are actually disabled) are also protected under the law. For example, if a landlord discriminates against a tenant because they think the tenant has a mental health condition, this would violate the law, even if the person didn’t have a mental health condition.\nAdditionally, people who are associated with a person who has a disability are also included in the laws protections. For example, refusing to rent to a tenant that has a family member with a mental health condition that will be visiting the tenant, would violate the law.\nFor more information, please see CRD’s Disability Discrimination Factsheet\nAre tenants or applicants with disabilities entitled to special treatment?\nYes. Tenants, residents, and applicants with disabilities are entitled to reasonable accommodations and/or modifications that are necessary to allow them an equal opportunity to use and enjoy housing, including a housing unit and any common areas. The refusal to grant reasonable accommodations and modifications constitutes unlawful discrimination under state and federal law. See below for examples of reasonable accommodations.\nFor more information, please see CRD’s Disability Discrimination Factsheet\nWhat is a reasonable accommodation?\nA reasonable accommodation is an exception, change, or adjustment in rules, policies, practices, or services that is necessary to allow a tenant, resident, or applicant with a disability to have an equal opportunity to use and enjoy housing.\nExamples of reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities include:\n- Reserved parking spaces\n- Making exceptions to a no-pets policy\n- Changing the date rent is due\n- Allowing a third party to cosign the lease or pay the rent\n- Allowing a tenant to have a live-in aide\n- Delaying an eviction\n- Giving someone more time to vacate a unit\n- Relocating a tenant to another unit\n- Allowing additional time to comply with a rule or policy\n- Modifying the terms of a lease\n- Providing additional notice to the tenant for inspections or repairs\nExamples of requests that cannot be reasonable accommodations include:\n- Reducing the rent\n- Permitting the use of illegal drugs\n- Something that would cause a direct threat to the health and safety of others, such as allowing an emotional support animal that bites at other tenants\n- Something that would cause substantial physical damage to the property of others\n- Adding an elevator to a building without one\nWhen an applicant or tenant requests a reasonable accommodation, does it have to be in writing?\nNo. A request for reasonable accommodation does not need to be in writing. The person making the request does not need to use any specific words – including “reasonable accommodation” – to make the request as long as they indicate needing an exception, change, or adjustment to a practice or policy because of a disability.\nWhen and how should a housing provider respond to a request for reasonable accommodation?\nRequests for accommodations must be considered promptly by the housing provider. The time necessary to respond to a request depends on various factors, including whether the accommodation is needed on an urgent basis. Failure to respond to a request for a reasonable accommodation constitutes unlawful housing discrimination.\nIf a housing provider cannot immediately grant a requested accommodation, they must engage in an “interactive process” with the requestor in an effort to come up with a solution. The purpose of the interactive process is to exchange information to identify, evaluate, and implement a reasonable accommodation that allows the individual with a disability equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling or housing opportunity. If the housing provider determines that they cannot grant the request, they must work with the requestor to try to identify if there is another accommodation that is equally effective in meeting their needs. The interactive process should occur in a timely manner and should be negotiated in good faith.\nCan a housing provider ask for documentation to verify the need for a reasonable accommodation or modification?\nYes. However, if the need for a reasonable accommodation or modification is obvious or known, further inquiry is not necessary. If the need is not obvious, the housing provider may only request information that:\n- Is necessary to establish that the individual has a disability\n- Describes the needed accommodation or modification\n- Is needed to show the relationship between the individual’s disability and how the requested accommodation or modification is necessary to afford the individual with a disability equal opportunity to use and enjoy the housing.\nA housing provider cannot seek information about:\n- A particular diagnosis or medical condition\n- The severity of the disability\n- Medical records\n- Medical history\n- Other disability or medical issues unrelated to the request\nDoes documentation of the need for an accommodation or modification have to be from a doctor?\nNo. Documentation can come from any reliable third party who is in a position to know about the individual’s disability or the disability-related need for accommodation, such as a health care provider, therapist, social worker, non-medical service provider, member of a peer support group, parent, child, or other relative. Reliable documentation of an individual’s disability and/or their need for a reasonable accommodation or modification can also be provided by the person making the request. This may include proof of receipt of disability-related benefits, such as SSI or SSDI or the requestor’s own credible statement. The determination of whether a third party is reliable is determined on a case-by-case basis and may take into account how the third party is familiar with the individual’s disability and/or the disability-related need for the accommodation.\nCan a housing provider have a “no pets” rule?\nYes, but the housing provider must make exceptions to the rule as a reasonable accommodation if it is necessary to allow a person with a disability to have an equal opportunity to enjoy housing. Refusing to allow necessary service animals or emotional-support animals is illegal discrimination. Service animals and emotional-support animals are not subject to breed, size, or weight restrictions ordinarily applied to pets, and tenants cannot be charged pet deposits or pet rent for them.\nWhat is the difference between an emotional support animal and a service animal?\nAn emotional support animal (ESA) is an animal that provides emotional, cognitive, or other similar support to a person with a disability to assist them in managing the symptoms of their disability. ESAs are also referred to as comfort animals or support animals. A service animal refers to an animal trained to perform specific tasks to assist an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. For example, guide dogs are service animals that assist people who are blind or have low vision with navigation, and signal dogs are service animals that alert individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing to sounds. An ESA is not a service animal because the ESA is not specifically trained to assist a person with a disability.\nFor more information, please see CRD’s Emotional Support Animals and Fair Housing Law factsheet\nDid Assembly Bill 468 change California fair housing law regarding ESAs?\nNo. In 2021, California enacted Assembly Bill 468, which, among other things, requires a\nbusiness selling emotional support dogs and/or ESA vests, tags, or certifications to notify the buyer that an ESA is not specifically trained to be a service dog and is not entitled to the rights and privileges accorded by law to service dogs. AB 468 also places some conditions on health care practitioners providing documentation relating to an individual’s need for an emotional support dog. Importantly, AB 468 expressly does not “restrict or change existing federal and state law related to a person’s rights for reasonable accommodation and equal access to housing,” and the Fair Employment and Housing Act invalidates any state law to the extent it purports to require or permit any unlawful housing discrimination, including the denial of reasonable accommodations. Therefore, housing providers must allow\nreasonable accommodations for ESAs under the rules described in these FAQs. This includes existing rules regarding what type of documentation establishes someone’s disability-related need for a reasonable accommodation to have an ESA.\nFor more information, see CRD’s Emotional Support Animals and Fair Housing Law factsheet.\nWhat is a reasonable modification?\nA reasonable modification is different from a reasonable accommodation because it is a physical change or alteration to a tenant’s unit or the common areas associated with the unit. A request for a change or alteration is considered to be a reasonable modification if it is necessary to afford the individual with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their home. Under most circumstances, the refusal by a landlord, HOA, or other housing provider to allow an individual with a disability the opportunity to make a reasonable modification constitutes unlawful housing discrimination. Some examples of reasonable modifications include:\n- Installing a grab bar in a bathroom\n- Widening doorways to make rooms more accessible for persons in wheelchairs\n- Lowering kitchen cabinets to a height suitable for persons in wheelchairs\n- Adding a ramp to make a primary entrance so it is accessible for persons in wheelchairs\n- Altering a walkway to provide access to a public or common use area\n- Installing “blinking” doorbells or emergency alarms to provide alerts to someone who is Deaf, or brailed signage for someone who is Blind.\nIf a tenant with a disability needs to modify the rental unit, is the housing provider required to pay for the modification?\nIn most instances, the tenant is responsible for all costs connected to the modification. This may include the cost of restoring the premises to the condition that existed before the modification (other than for reasonable wear and tear). However, a housing provider is required to pay for the modification if:\n- The housing is government subsidized, such as when the housing provider is a government entity, or the recipient of federal or state funding for affordable housing, or part of a government entity’s program or activities to provide housing\n- The modifications are needed because of a failure to maintain the housing, especially of it involves an accessible feature (such as an elevator)\n- The accessibility feature was required by building and accessibility codes at the time of construction, but the building/housing provider failed to comply with those codes\nCan a housing provider refuse to rent to someone because of their source of income?\nNo. California law protects tenants from discrimination based on how a tenant will be paying rent (“source of income”). This includes the State of California’s COVID-19 Rent Relief Program, Housing Choice (Section 8) vouchers, (SSI) social security disability benefits, or wages earned from a job. Some examples of source of income discrimination include:\n- Refusal to comply with the requirements of any public assistance, rental assistance, or housing subsidy program, such as refusing to fill out necessary paperwork or to provide necessary information or documents\n- Applying different terms, conditions, and privileges to a tenancy based on the applicant or renter’s source of income, such as charging a higher security deposit for Section 8 applicants or refusing to allow tenants who are using rental assistance from using a pool or other amenities\n- Advertising a preference or limitation based on a tenant’s source of income, such as including in an a “No Section 8.”\nFor more information, see CRD’s Source of Income Discrimination factsheet and Source of Income FAQ\nCan a housing provider consider an applicant’s criminal history in deciding whether or not to rent to them?\nYes. Generally, a housing provider may check the criminal history of an applicant, but there are some limitations. Housing providers cannot consider some types of criminal history including arrests that did not lead to a conviction, records that are sealed or expunged, or records or matters processed in the juvenile justice system. Housing providers are also prohibited from having “blanket bans” of all people with a criminal history.\nIf a housing provider intends to deny someone’s application based on a criminal conviction, it must be directly-related to someone’s ability to be a good tenant and to not be a threat to the health and safety of others and the property. In determining whether a criminal conviction is directly-related, a housing provider should consider the nature and severity of the crime and the amount of time that has passed since the criminal conduct occurred.\nFor more information, please see CRD’s Fair Housing and Criminal History factsheet and Fair Housing and Criminal History FAQ\nDoes the law protect tenants from harassment by housing providers and other tenants?\nYes. California’s fair housing laws prohibit housing providers (including their employees or agents) and other tenants from discriminating against or harassing a tenant, resident, home seeker, applicant, homeowner, and others, because of a protected characteristic. Housing providers have a duty to correct and end discriminatory housing practices, including harassment, committed not only by the housing provider but also by third parties (such as other tenants, other residents, or contractors hired by the housing provider) when the housing provider has the legal responsibility or authority to correct it.\nFor more information, see CRD’s Housing Harassment Prevention Guide and Sexual Harassment in Housing factsheet\nMust I be a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident to file a complaint of housing discrimination?\nNo. California’s fair housing laws protect Californians regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. CRD does not inquire about a complainant’s citizenship or immigration status.\nFor more information, see CRD’s California Protects the Civil Rights of Immigrants factsheet\nWhat are the time limits for filing a complaint of housing discrimination?\nIn general, a complaint of housing discrimination must be filed within one year from the date an alleged discriminatory act occurred.\nIf I already filed a complaint with the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), can I also file with CRD?\nIf a complaint has been filed with HUD, it will automatically be filed with CRD as well. In most cases, HUD will send the complaint to CRD for investigation. If a complaint is filed with CRD and alleges facts that would violate the federal Fair Housing Act, the complaint is automatically filed with HUD, although CRD will investigate.\nDoes a person have to file a housing complaint with CRD before filing a complaint in court?\nNo. A person may file directly in court without first filing a complaint with CRD. This is different than filing an employment case, which must first be filed with CRD before a person can file a complaint in court. The time limit for filing in court is two years from the date of the alleged discrimination. If a complaint has been filed with CRD, the two-year time period does not include the time CRD spent processing the case.\nDoes CRD help people find housing or resolve landlord/tenant problems connected with their current housing?\nCRD does not help people find housing. CRD cannot help with housing issues not related to discrimination, and does not represent tenants in unlawful detainers. When unrelated to discrimination, CRD does not have jurisdiction over:\n- Plumbing, heating, or electrical problems\n- Failure to make repairs\n- Pests or vermin\n- Excessive noise\n- Entry without enough notice\n- Evictions\n- Violation of rent-control laws\n- Failure to return security deposit\n- Other housing issues\nDoes CRD help people resolve problems connected with subprime residential mortgage lending?\nPredatory lending is primarily a consumer law issue affecting all borrowers. Consumers can best seek relief under the Unfair Competition Law (UCL) by filing complaints against those businesses with the California Attorney General’s Office, which enforces the UCL. Consumers can also file complaints against residential mortgage lenders with the California Department of Corporations, which licenses and regulates lenders. However, if residential predatory lending has occurred because of discrimination against a protected category covered by FEHA, CRD has jurisdiction and should be able to assist those aggrieved borrowers.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

The Marshall Project used text analysis to identify 13 major claims about immigration in over 350,000 of Trump’s public statements from Factba.se, some of which Trump has made 500 times or more. All of them are untrue or deeply misleading.\nResearch has shown that as someone hears a statement more times, it feels more true.\nMillions of Americans and people worldwide have heard these claims. Here they are, fact-checked by the staff of The Marshall Project.\nTrump claims that:\n▪ Unauthorized immigrants are criminals [said 575+ times], snakes that bite [35+ times], eating pets, coming from jails and mental institutions [560+ times], causing crime in sanctuary cities [185+ times], and a group of isolated, tragic cases prove they are killing Americans en masse [235+ times].\n▪ They are stealing Americans’ public benefits [270+ times] and jobs [155+ times].\n▪ He has to build a wall [675+], and mass deportations are acceptable because Eisenhower did it [50+ times].\nSkip to the end for more context about these repeated falsehoods.\nclaimed by trump more than 550 times\nFor Donald Trump, immigrants bring crime. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said during his 2015 campaign announcement. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.”\nBut immigration in the U.S. is strongly associated with lower crime. Looking at data from 200 metropolitan areas, a 2017 study found immigrants are “less likely to offend than native born Americans” and “for property crimes, immigration has a consistently negative effect” on a region’s crime rate. That trend, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) research found, has been consistent all the way back to 1870.\nThose findings hold true for undocumented immigrants. Using estimates of undocumented populations, researchers in 2018 found that “undocumented immigration does not increase violence.” Similarly, a study published one year earlier asserted undocumented immigrants have lower rates of drug arrests, overdoses and drunk driving offenses than native-born Americans.\nWhy do immigrants commit fewer crimes? One theory is that the type of person willing to pack up their entire life to seek prosperity in America is also the type of person unwilling to put all of that at risk through criminal behavior, according to a 2007 NBER paper.\nWhile first-generation immigrants generally display lower levels of criminality, their descendants tend to behave more and more like the greater U.S. population as their families assimilate. “By the second generation, immigrants have simply caught up to their native-born counterparts,” reads a 2014 study.\nTrump’s oft-repeated assertion that immigrants make crime worse is shared by around half of Americans, according to a 2023 survey — a number relatively consistent with when Pew started asking the question nearly a quarter-century ago. Only 5% of respondents thought immigrants reduce crime.\nDonald Trump has repeatedly claimed that millions of immigrants crossing the southern U.S. border were intentionally released from overseas jails, prisons and asylums, especially in countries like Venezuela.\nThese claims have been routinely debunked by journalists, researchers and fact-checkers. Pressed multiple times, Trump’s campaign has not been able to corroborate the claims, making it difficult to fact-check something that may not exist.\nA kernel of truth driving Trump’s claim is that federal officials say they’ve encountered Venezuelan gang members crossing the southern border, though in nowhere near the numbers the former president is pushing. And there’s no evidence they were incarcerated or systematically released, intentionally or otherwise, to infiltrate the U.S.\nCriminology and immigration experts, both inside and outside of Venezuela, told El País, the largest daily Spanish-language newspaper in the world, that there’s been no emptying of prisons and mental institutions. Meanwhile, Trump has exaggerated and misattributed the country’s decline in violent crime. A 2023 annual report on violence from an alliance of Venezuelan universities links a more modest 25% decline in violence to peace agreements between organized gangs and fewer opportunities for crime amid a suffering economy. The report does say outward migration of youth gangs temporarily drove up violence in neighboring countries.\nRepublicans echo Trump’s accusations. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott proclaimed the border a disaster less than five months into the Biden administration. Last month, Abbott amended that proclamation to label Tren de Aragua — the Venezuelan gang at the heart of Trump’s unfounded claim — a terrorist organization.\nDonald Trump has claimed that Mexico is flooding the border with drug dealers, criminals and rapists by repeating emotionally powerful anecdotes. Two weeks after his 2015 presidential campaign announcement, Trump latched onto a poster child: Jose Garcia-Zarate, a five-times deported Mexican national who was charged with murder for fatally shooting 32-year-old Kate Steinle on a pier in San Francisco. She died in her father’s arms.\nTrump repeatedly invoked Steinle’s killing as part of an immigrant crime wave and said that he is “the only one who can fix it.”\nTrump’s focus on Garcia-Zarate is part of a pattern of highlighting undocumented people of color killing or raping White women: Lakin Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin and Marilyn Pharis.\nWhile each of these violent crimes is tragic, multiple studies have shown there is no crime wave: Documented and undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans. Individual cases of violence can always be found within a population of some 11 million undocumented immigrants, said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a professor at the Moritz School of Law.\nThese individual stories “serve as useful rallying points around which his supporters and members of the right-wing media ecosystem are willing to devote immense amounts of time,” García Hernández said.\nAnd some of Trump’s cases aren’t what he claims they are. A jury acquitted Garcia-Zarate of murder, finding the gun went off by accident and ricocheted off the pier before killing Steinle. Trump called it “a disgraceful verdict” and tweeted, “BUILD THE WALL!”\nSteinle’s family did not appreciate the attention. “For Donald Trump, we were just what he needed — beautiful girl, San Francisco, illegal immigrant, arrested a million times, a violent crime and yadda, yadda, yadda,” Liz Sullivan, Steinle’s mother, told the San Francisco Chronicle. “We were the perfect storm for that man.”\nFederal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections and the available evidence shows attempts to get around the law are vanishingly rare.\nState-level reviews of voter rolls have routinely found negligible numbers of noncitizens attempting or successfully registering to vote. For example, earlier this year in Ohio, about 600 noncitizens were found to have registered to vote. Of those, about 138 are believed to have cast a ballot, representing about 0.002% of the state’s registered voters. Similarly, in August, a yearslong review in Texas found about 2,000 “potential” noncitizens with voting histories on Texas voter rolls — or 0.01% of the electorate — but to date, none have been accused of voting illegally.\nRepublicans have still tried to tighten voter registration laws, specifically the 2024 SAVE Act legislation, which would force states to verify citizenship before adding someone to the voter rolls, an effort that Democrats have stymied to this point.\nAnother version of Trump’s argument is that pro-immigrant efforts by Democrats pad the census counts of Democrat-majority districts and give the party an advantage in House representation and the Electoral College. Trump ally Elon Musk has repeatedly echoed this claim, falsely claiming that Democrats have gained as many as 20 seats in the House due to illegal immigration.\nMultiple analyses have found that illegal immigration is responsible for between 0 and 1 additional Democratic representatives in the House based on the 2020 census. Additionally, at the statewide level, noncitizen arrivals have been concentrated in Republican-leaning states since 2019, according to an analysis by the Cato Institute.\nAlthough there is no single definition for a “sanctuary city,” Donald Trump is broadly referring to states or municipalities that choose not to cooperate with federal immigration authorities to arrest or detain people suspected of violating the country’s immigration laws. It’s a movement that traces its origins back to the 1980s, when churches banded together to shelter refugees fleeing violence in El Salvador and Guatemala. These religious communities offered migrants protection in open defiance of the federal government.\nTrump’s claims that these policies lead to increased crime by undocumented immigrants are central to the larger debate over whether the sanctuary movement threatens the safety of the local communities embracing it.\nResearch shows that there is no link between sanctuary policies and rising crime rates. There are numerous studies that reach the same conclusion using various types of statistical research methods. Instead, researchers find that migrants are less likely to commit crimes than their native-born counterparts.\nA 2017 study found that, across 107 U.S. cities, homicide and robbery rates tended to drop as the number of undocumented immigrants from Mexico increased, but only in sanctuary cities. One theory explaining why is that sanctuary policies allow undocumented immigrants to interact with law enforcement without fear of deportation, producing “a spiral of trust that supports police and raises informal social control over crime.”\nAt rally after rally, Donald Trump asks the crowd if they want to hear the poem “The Snake” and the audience roars. A Marshall Project analysis estimates he has read or referenced the poem at least three dozen times.\nThe poem is actually the lyrics of a song based on one of Aesop’s fables, in which a tender-hearted woman picks up a frozen snake and warms it. When it’s revived, the snake repays her kindness with a poisonous bite. She asks him why he would kill her and the snake replies, “You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.” In a speech in South Carolina, Trump told the crowd the lyrics were pertinent in light of “people coming into our country who are going to cause tremendous problems.”\nMisinformation can come in the form of outright lies, but also in the less tangible, and more difficult to fact-check, medium of a metaphor. A 2018 academic paper analyzed Trump’s use of metaphor and found he frequently evoked the image of immigrants as animals. “He uses this metaphor to present himself as a hero, as someone who will protect you from these animals,” a study author told Frontline.\nIronically, the song was written by civil rights activist and musician Oscar Brown Jr. Brown, who wrote essays against racism, ran as a progressive candidate in Illinois and for a brief time joined the Communist Party.\nIn an interview, Brown’s daughter Africa Brown said her father was “never against immigrants” and said, “Trump is the living embodiment of the snake that my father wrote about in that song.”\nDonald Trump’s assertions that members of Hamas, ISIS and other extremist groups are entering the country as refugees to conduct acts of terrorism largely don’t hold up to reality. Historically, most perpetrators of terror attacks have been U.S.-born citizens or permanent legal residents from countries not part of the Trump administration’s “Muslim ban,” which restricted travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\nA 2023 Cato Institute analysis found that the annual odds of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack by a refugee is one in 3.3 billion. The likelihood of being killed in a terrorist attack by any foreigner is one in 4.3 million, and the chance of being killed in a terrorist attack committed by an undocumented immigrant is “zero.”\nAccording to a 2015 Migration Policy Institute article examining nearly 800,000 resettled refugees since Sept. 11, 2001, only three — two Iraqi and one Uzbek — have been arrested for planning terror attacks: Two were to take place abroad, and one was “barely credible.” However, the following year, a Somali refugee in Ohio stabbed 13 people (none of whom died).\nAfter Israel’s invasion and bombardment of Gaza in response to Hamas’ attack that killed almost 1,200 Israelis and took over 250 hostages last year, Trump claimed, without evidence, that the “same people” behind the attack in Israel were entering the U.S. through “our totally open southern border.”\nPalestinians in Gaza largely cannot escape the war outside the strip’s borders because of Israel’s land, sea and air blockade. The main U.N. agency settling Palestinian refugees does not refer them to the U.S. The number of Palestinian refugees going through other countries, and referred to the U.S. by nongovernmental organizations, is quite small and subject to rigorous vetting to identify anyone posing “security risks.” According to the State Department, fewer than 600 Palestinians have come to the U.S. as refugees in the last decade. In the 2023 fiscal year, out of more than 60,000 total refugees accepted by the U.S., only 56 were Palestinian.\nDonald Trump often repeats that undocumented immigrants put a financial burden on American taxpayers by taking advantage of public welfare benefits. “Illegal immigration costs the United States more than 200 Billion Dollars a year. How was this allowed to happen?” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in 2018.\nUndocumented immigrants are able to use some public services. Undocumented children can receive public education. And the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), provides items like baby formula to low-income parents, including undocumented ones. However, fear often keeps undocumented immigrants from taking advantage of their benefits. After Trump took office, many undocumented families withdrew from WIC for fear of being detected and deported.\nUndocumented immigrants are ineligible for many other public benefits. Undocumented people can pay into Social Security and unemployment insurance, but are unable to access them themselves.\nThis is in contrast to veterans, who have benefits like the Veterans Health Administration, the GI bill to pay for education and specialized loan assistance programs.\nA report from the Cato Institute argued that undocumented immigrants could be a net benefit to public coffers because they tend to pay more in taxes than they consume in government services.\nUndocumented people contribute to the American economy by working, earning income and paying sales, income and payroll taxes, including through automatic paycheck withholdings or by using taxpayer identification numbers instead of Social Security numbers. Again, fear and lack of information about the tax preparation process often keeps undocumented people from receiving tax credits they may otherwise qualify for.\nAccording to a study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, undocumented immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in 2022 in federal, state and local taxes.\nOn the night Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination, Donald Trump claimed, if given the chance, she would “allow more than 100 million illegal aliens into our country.”\nAlthough Trump says Democratic politicians like Harris support “open borders,” both Harris’ presidential platform and the Biden administration’s current policies advocate for strong border enforcement.\nSince becoming the Democratic nominee, Harris has called for stricter asylum rules and vowed to prosecute drug-smuggling gangs. “The United States is a sovereign nation, and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our border and to enforce them,” Harris said during a recent visit to the border town of Douglas, Arizona.\nIn some ways, the Biden administration carried over Trump’s immigration policies. Both administrations enforced Title 42, a pandemic-related policy allowing Border Patrol agents to turn away migrants on the grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19.\nAfter Title 42 was lifted last May, the State Department clarified this change “does not mean the border is open.” Instead, immigration rules reverted to Title 8, which imposes harsher penalties for illegal border crossings, such as deportation and a five-year ban on reentry — consequences not enforced under Title 42.\nHowever, border crossings continued to rise and, earlier this year, President Joe Biden issued an executive order stopping the government from processing asylum requests when Border Patrol’s daily number of encounters with “removable noncitizens” averages more than 2,500 over the course of a week. Harris has pledged to reduce that limit to 1,500 per week.\nBiden’s order mandates deportation for anyone denied asylum, which exposes them to criminal charges and a long-term ban on reentering the U.S. A month after the order, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported the lowest arrest levels since September 2020, with a 32% decrease in illegal crossings.\nDonald Trump often points to the 1950s-era immigration policies of then-President Dwight Eisenhower when discussing his plans for mass deportations of migrants.\n“He moved out 1.5 million people and brought them back to where they came from,” Trump said during a 2015 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity.\nOperation Wetback, Eisenhower’s military-style deportation operation targeting undocumented immigrants, whose name comes from an anti-Latino slur, has been an inspiration for the former president and current presidential candidate. “We’re rounding them up in a very humane way, a very nice way,” Trump told “60 Minutes” in 2015. When asked to elaborate, he referred to deportations under the Eisenhower administration.\nBut despite Trump’s sympathetic characterization of Operation Wetback, historians widely describe it as inhumane. It’s not just that the deportations also ensnared U.S. citizens. Historian Mae Ngai wrote that, in one roundup, 88 migrants died of sunstroke. Ngai also pointed to a congressional investigation comparing conditions on a boat used for deportations to an “eighteenth century slave ship.” Many who survived the voyage were displaced to unfamiliar locations within Mexico.\nHistorians also contest the number of people deported. After the 1954 initiative, officials reported over a million migrant apprehensions and expulsions. But researcher Kelly Lytle Hernández’s review of records shows apprehensions and expulsions fell closer to 250,000. Hernández argues that the initiative’s results, much touted by officials, were “less than they were portrayed to be.”\nStill, she wrote, that “does not render the summer of 1954 meaningless” because it directed greater public attention to the United States’ ongoing push to exert increasing control over its southern border.\nDuring Donald Trump’s presidential run in 2015, he told rallygoers, “They’re taking our jobs.” At the time, the amorphous “they” were people from Mexico. And the jobs were manufacturing jobs.\nThis election cycle, Trump still says “they” are taking our jobs. This time, the meaning of “they” has evolved to encompass anyone who enters the U.S. illegally, and the jobs are what Trump has repeatedly called “Black jobs” and union jobs, reflecting two groups of potential voters the former president is courting.\nWhen Trump’s original claims surfaced, the Urban Institute noted that while immigrants were increasingly filling low-skilled, low-wage jobs here, the types of jobs were different from jobs native-born Americans did. Immigrant workers, especially those with less education, worked as maids, house cleaners, cooks and in agricultural jobs. Similar native-born workers were cashiers, sales clerks and janitors. Zooming out, a 2007 National Bureau of Economic Research study found that the last large wave of immigration led to a dip in employment for Black people at lower skill levels and, perhaps, higher incarceration rates.\nIn a September speech, Trump said that “Kamala Harris’ border invasion is also crushing the jobs and wages of African American workers and Hispanic American workers, and also union members.” It’s true that Black workers have largely had lower wages and higher unemployment rates than White workers for decades, due to discrimination and other barriers. In recent years, Black workers and all low-wage workers have seen their paychecks grow, driven by state-level boosts to minimum wage, and wage growth for Black workers from 2019 to 2023 outpaced White workers.\nWhen it comes to union jobs, until the early 2000s, modern labor and manufacturing unions were staunchly anti-immigration but flipped that stance and supported amnesty policies. A widely circulated paper from the Cato Institute found a link between increases in immigration in general — whether legal or not — and a drop in unionization.\nBuilding a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border has been a centerpiece of Donald Trump’s immigration policy. He argues it’s effective at curbing illegal border crossings and that Mexico can cover the construction costs.\nBut the reality of building a wall at the border is more complex and its efficacy is dubious.\nAccording to a Government Accountability Office report, from 2017 through January 2021, the Trump administration added about 450 miles of barriers along the over-1,900-mile expanse. But 81% of the new structures replaced old ones. Government officials and others “noted that the barriers led to various impacts, including to cultural resources, water sources, and endangered species, and from erosion,” the report said. Also, because of the wall, people are more likely to try to cross at more dangerous points, contributing to more injuries and deaths.\nHistorically, many undocumented immigrants have come into the country legally and overstayed their visas, something a wall wouldn’t prevent. Additionally, people have found ways of circumventing the wall with tunnels and even a hidden rail system.\nA review by The Washington Post of Customs and Border Protection records found smuggling gangs had sawed through the wall 3,272 times from 2019 to 2021, usually cutting it “with inexpensive power tools widely available at retail hardware stores.”\nThus far, despite Trump’s promises, Mexico has not covered the nearly $20-million-per-mile expense of building a border wall.\nTrump\nThe people that came in, they’re eating the cats... They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.\nFact-check\nThere is no evidence to support claims that Haitian migrants are abducting, killing or eating people’s pets in Springfield, Ohio.\nDuring a recent presidential debate against Kamala Harris, Donald Trump made some shocking claims about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio.\n“They’re eating the dogs. The people that came in,” he said. “They’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country. And it’s a shame.”\nTrump’s assertions about migrants eating pets drew further attention to other claims he and his vice presidential running mate, Sen. JD Vance, made: that migrants were in the U.S. illegally and that their presence had led to an increase in both crime and communicable diseases.\nIn a statement, Springfield spokesperson Karen Graves asserted “that there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.”\nIn a post on Springfield’s website, city leaders refuted claims about the city’s Haitian population committing high levels of crime or being undocumented. An August report from health officials in Clark County, where Springfield is the largest city, showed that, excluding COVID, infectious disease case counts in the county remained relatively similar to a decade ago, well before Springfield’s influx of Haitian migrants began.\nPolice body camera video purportedly showing a Haitian woman eating a cat in Springfield was ultimately determined to be an incident involving a U.S.-born American woman from Canton, Ohio, a nearly three-hour drive from Springfield. The woman was arrested on animal cruelty charges and her attorney requested she undergo a mental health evaluation. A similar story falsely claiming a Haitian migrant had captured a pair of endangered geese has also been debunked.\nSimilar tales of Haitian migrants eating cats and dogs date back to the 1980s, when it became a popular insult against Haitian American youth in places like South Florida. Haitians are not alone in being targeted with these types of rumors. Other migrant populations, including people from Asia, have been accused of using pets for food.\nKamala Harris: A more positive tone, backs tough policies\nReporters also searched for and reviewed Vice President Kamala Harris’ public statements about immigration. Since the Factba.se database is focused on presidential candidates, data for Harris was limited to the time since she became the Democratic nominee in July, resulting in far fewer statements than what was available for Trump. What statements there were, though, indicated a more positive tone toward immigration and those seeking asylum in the U.S.\n“Innocent people.” “Children who had fled incredible violence.” “Displaced.” “Dreamers.” “Families.” “Muslim brothers and sisters.” “We’re all immigrants.”\nWhile Harris frequently references her record of prosecuting transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers, she also supports the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants: “Let’s bring all of these folks out of the shadows into the sunlight, and be true to the value that we have as a country.”\nStill, as vice president, she has expressed what experts call the party’s toughest approach to immigration in a generation. Though these measures fall far short of Trump’s extreme proposals like mass deportations, they include increased border enforcement, raising the bar for asylum, and expanding immigrant detention centers.\nHarris also often cites a tough border security bill she supported. The bill would have increased funding for border personnel, shut loopholes related to the asylum system, reduced the ability of migrants to temporarily enter the country, and given more discretion to the president to close down the border. Trump derailed the bill, in part because its passage would “make things much better for the opposing side.”\n“Our administration worked on the most significant border security bill in decades. Some of the most conservative Republicans in Washington, D.C., supported the bill. Even the Border Patrol endorsed it. It was all set to pass. But at the last minute, Trump directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down,” said Harris.\nThe harm of repeating the false link between immigration and crime\nEven recognizing that a statement is false becomes more difficult when someone repeatedly hears false information.\nIn what cognitive scientists call the “illusory truth effect,” the more someone hears a statement, the more likely they are to believe it. A leading explanation for the phenomenon is that repetition makes information easier to process, making it seem more truthful. A 2021 study found that even as the greatest increase in perceived truth happened when subjects heard a piece of information a second time, subjects reported perceptions of truth increased with repetition up to nine times, and didn’t decrease with further repetition.\nFalsely linking immigration and crime has resulted in real policies. These include Secure Communities, a Department of Homeland Security Program that flags immigrants in local law enforcement custody for deportation, and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program, which delegates some immigration enforcement tasks to local law enforcement.\n“None of them delivered the increased public safety that was promised,” said Charis Kubrin, a professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California, Irvine. “Why? Because immigrant criminality was not a problem to begin with.”\nAccording to Kubrin, this focus shifts attention and resources from other public safety concerns such as mass shootings, violence against women and crimes with broad economic impact like fraud, corporate negligence and failure in regulation.\nDiscrediting election results\nClaims about immigration and crime can also strengthen attempts to discredit the results of the 2020 general election, and potentially, the 2024 general election.\nGov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia accepted the 2020 election results while raising concerns about noncitizen voting. While campaigning for Trump during the 2024 election, Youngkin highlighted his state’s purging of 6,303 names recorded as noncitizens from voter rolls. Election administrators say these registrations are often the result of errors when filling out paperwork and there are no records of noncitizens casting votes, and few instances of illegal voting in general. Youngkin’s registration removals now face a federal lawsuit.\nIn Texas, the right-wing group True the Vote has led a campaign to challenge voter registrations in the state, leaving election officials to process thousands of challenges while ensuring that voters aren’t improperly removed. While most of the Texas challenges are over the residence of the voter, the group behind the challenges has stoked claims of noncitizen voting.\nTrue the Vote, and other groups have also challenged registrations in states like Arizona, California, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The challenges are often based on name-matching software that has known issues with data quality and usability. This comes after activists pushed Republican-led states to leave the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a partnership of state election administrators that many regarded as the most rigorous system for helping states maintain up-to-date voter rolls.\nNormalizing hardline policies\nScholars have noted the cumulative effect of scapegoating immigration. Trump’s rhetoric helped shift the window of acceptable language, and policy, toward immigrants, making controversial practices like family separation or mass deportation more palatable, Laura Finley and Luigi Esposito, sociology and criminology professors at Barry University, wrote in a 2020 article.\nIn 2018, researchers reviewed available studies on policies that limited local cooperation with immigration enforcement, often referred to as “sanctuary” policies, and found there was little evidence that linked such policies, or immigration overall, to more crime. The researchers concluded that linking immigration and crime allows xenophobia and racism to be expressed under a “color-blind” concept of “rule-of-law.”\nPolls show more Americans favor fewer immigrants and more restrictions on immigration. A July Gallup poll found that 55% of respondents wanted a decrease in immigration. The poll, which has asked about immigration levels since 1965, has not found such a high level of those who wanted decreased immigration in nearly two decades. Other 2024 polls also show support for tougher border measures and that many Americans find immigration to be a key problem facing the country.\nThe same poll shows broad support for tougher immigration measures. A majority of those polled support temporarily halting migrants from seeking asylum at the Southwest border, hiring more border patrol agents and expanding walls at that border. Nearly half support deporting all immigrants in the country illegally. Despite this, large majorities also supported some path to citizenship for those in the country without authorization. Support for the restrictive measures rose from five years ago while support for pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants fell.\nPolling also shows support for tougher state immigration policy. An August poll found 63% of polled Arizona voters supported Proposition 314, a ballot measure before voters in the November 2024 election. The measure would make crossing the border with Mexico outside ports of entry a state crime, allowing state and local police to arrest migrants for the new crime.\nThe effects of repeating a lie\nBeyond Trump, there is a growing partisan divide around the way politicians talk about immigrants. In a 2022 article published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers describe how they analyzed over 200,000 U.S. congressional speeches and 5,000 presidential communications on immigration since the late 1800s. While there has been a general trend toward more positive language on immigration, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to use words like “crime,” “legality” and “threat” and to use dehumanizing language, the researchers found.\nPoliticians across parties and nations continue to reap rewards by blaming immigrants for social problems. “Politicians, from far-right populists to centrist liberals, use anti-immigrant narratives to deflect attention from deeper systematic issues such as affordable housing shortages, economic inequalities and failing public services,” Yvonne Su, director of the Centre for Refugee Studies at York University, wrote last month.\nFor Alex Piquero, a University of Miami criminology professor and former director of the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the body of research is “absolutely clear” that immigrants are not responsible for increases in crime.\nBut beliefs to the contrary are persistent. “What we have here is a mismatch between what the data show and what the political rhetoric says,“ Piquero said.\nTrump seems confident in the power of repetition. “I could get elected twice over the wall,” he said in a speech at CPAC in 2020. That didn’t happen that year. Will it happen in November?\nThis story was updated to omit the minimum number that some claims are repeated.\nCredits\nREPORTING AND WRITING\nAnna Flagg, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón, Geoff Hing\nFACT CHECKS\nAala Abdullahi, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón, Rachel Dissell, Daphne Duret, Shannon Heffernan, Ghazala Irshad, Jamiles Lartey, Doug Livingston, Ilica Mahajan, Ana Graciela Méndez, Joseph Neff, Aaron Sankin, Chris Vazquez\nDATA ANALYSIS\nRobert Flagg, Anna Flagg\nAUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT\nAshley Dye, Chris Vazquez, Kristin Bausch\nCOPY EDITING\nKelsey Adams, Lauren Hardie, Ghazala Irshad\nTRANSLATION\nAna Graciela Méndez, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón\nVIDEO EDITING\nAlex Gilwit, Celina Fang, Anna Flagg\nPROJECT MANAGEMENT\nAndrew Rodriguez Calderón\nPRODUCTION COORDINATION\nMara Corbett, Ruth Baldwin\nPARTNERSHIPS\nTerri Troncale, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón\nEDITING\nDavid Eads, Aaron Sankin, Susan Chira\nDISTRIBUTION PARTNERS\nDocumentedNY\nSpecial thanks to Moiz Syed for contributing design.\nLearn about how The Marshall Project is covering the 2024 election’s criminal justice and immigration issues across the U.S. and in our local news teams’ cities.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        In a recent video message from his desk at VA Central Office, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins addressed media concerns that Veterans’ benefits might be targeted for cuts.\n“I’m the Secretary of VA, and I’m telling you right now, that’s not happening… the reality is, Veterans benefits aren’t getting cut,” Collins said. “In fact, we are actually giving and improving services.”\nHe went on to emphasize that the Veterans Benefits Administration is clearing cases faster than ever and that VA remains mission-focused by doing what it is supposed to do.\nNow, in his first full week on the job, Collins also addressed concerns about the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and rumors regarding access to Veterans’ personal information.

Unless we have a name and a title then it is impossible to give compliments (as I did for one person from the OK office) or complaints.\nThank you in advance for providing a way for us to communicate DIRECTLY with your office, as many of these messages seem to “disappear.” Why can’t or won’t you identify an OMBUDSMAN team consisting of people who are committed to initiating ACTION to help solve REAL PROBLEMS?\nBR,\nDr. PDG, Jakarta\nDoug Collins is a liar. He is Trump’s VA puppet.\nThese politicians will say whatever they need to say to make it seem as if they care. They don’t care about me or you. I have been fighting for disability compensation since 2018 and my claims continue to get denied by someone sitting in a cubicle making decisions about whether or not my injuries were caused by my service to this country. The way the VA is set up is backwards. The VA shouldn’t be denying anyone their benefits that they earned. In fact, the VA should be the ones to prove that the injuries you sustained weren’t from the military, not the other way around. The way this country treats its veterans is shameful. Now we have a new Secretary of the Va but the same old BS. No transparency . I would love to talk to this Va Secretary but they have no interest in fixing this disaster. Just collect a paycheck that is paid for by you and me .\nDAC (Disabled American Veterans) has nothing to do with and does not receive any money from the government. DAV exists to help veterans, their widows/widowers and dependants deal with VA.\nI sent am email to the DAV a month ago asking them to help me with my claim.. I still haven’t received any response. It is good that the President is getting rid of the dead beats.\nDon’t expect anything from these incompetent fascist liars. trump actively hates veterans. Stop falling for his bullshit.\ns south korea 67-68 agent orange–7 years + if presumption of exposure is verified by VA\nif diseases are on the VA list that VA excepts THEN why would the VA deny benefits it may be the system GOOD LUCK\nfellow veterans please lets try to mind our words and stand by if we have nothing positive to contribute on this message forum- lets try to work together as i write this their are 2,238 comments on here and some are well intentioned, some are revealing our divide amongst our sides. I am on neither side I am with all of you as fellow Americans. This forum has been open since 05 November 2010, this thread has gotten the most comments ever and some are positive other’s are honest. I want to leave a food for thought moment, you are drowning in the ocean and the person who can save you is from across the aisle your political opposite. Is our divide animosity so strong that we may think it best to drown instead of receiving support from a fellow American.\nRespectfully,\naguilar santos\nFuck that. Fuck trump and fuck anyone who supports him. They are a threat and should be treated as such. Your both sides nonsense accomplishes nothing.\nWe need to get rid of nonVetrans in Key administration positions of regional VA Offices\nYes! They are mostly contractors. They are in charge of approving our benefits.\nIt’s sad that there are so many misinformed or ignorant postings on this site against President Trump. The government is going to run out of money and no one is going to get any benefits if the US goes bankrupt and the currency is devalued and we lose the dollar as a reserve currency. Most government offices, need to be reformed, but accurately reformed.. the number of NGO’s ripping off the taxpayer is phenomenal.\nEat shit, moron. Trump supporters are traitors and fascists.\nI don’t trust them yet.\nDon’t trust trump loyalists ever.\nThis person was on a network espousing how they cut only those who need cutting. Acknowledging he states lawyer first in his bio, where does he get his healthcare? Have gotten nothing but excellent service at the VA as did my father. Thank you Veterans.\nMore talk—–Wants you to think ,he talks the talk, to make things happen—-I can not see the end of my claim and it’s on it’s 13th month —-no communication anywhere in this Circus, travel on your time and gas and then wait for ages to even get reimbursed ——this is a like real life scene from FBI last Monday——-that was the truth.- check the reruns on Paramont that is what 100’s of our Vets are going thru.\ngreat now find those files and pay them been ready since 2023 oct was to pay may 2024 o ou are the only one per admirals etc who is at that pay level to okd and pass to payables then after 286 pd they are the oldest wating then take pf the next bunch it is not hard sit down and get this done about 3 hrs of your time also cant communicate stil waiting for pass code so where is that email. next is there no funds to take care this tell the yrue factsor jd is over this dept need help i will drive there and read each file you neglecting for some reason retirement is noexcuse so sPitit out i am older than you. so man show some guts if this postion is beyond your norm then step aside\n.DO YOU HAVE REQUIRED MANAGEMENT AND GET THESE THINGS DONE SKILLS. PROVE YOURSELF\nI’m wondering what happened to Mike Nachinek over the department of Veterans affairs? I couldn’t even get a case number through my father’s illness John Paul Brewer retired US Navy. My cases are at oscn.net Mayes county in appeal . I sent complaints today online to HHS and I would like prosecution due to a letter from Donald J Trump President to stop false hospice.\nVery unliley that anything gets better, when so many people (incluyding a ton of VETS) are getting fired. Sounds like more fo that “Just Believe me” stuff. Would love an IG that is a retired VET put in place and the VA leadership actually woirks with him to cut waste but employ imprvement prgrams WITH Measurable metrics.\nOne of the problems I have experienced is when I ask for a referral for community care outside of the VA. Sometimes it takes several months. Case in point, it took me from September last until March 11 this year 2025. I found out it was sent to VA several times. It was found to be on head dentist in Tuskegee since Jan 18 of this year. Had to get another’s Doctor to override last week. This happens quite often with my primary doctor at the Podeshef Clinic in Columbus Ga.\nThank you\nBilly Cumbie\nDear Honorable secretary of Veterans affairs. Please contact the President to force prosecution around a Sept 17 2019 VA case filed in the Mayes county courts with inspector general HHS complaints made today. I will have to go back and submit Medicare and Medicaid information. Please study cases at http://www.oscn.net for international false profiling around healthcare that led to inveigling,elder abuse,medical restraints through false hospice under Sheriff Mike Reed Pryor Ok\nYou will not get a meaningful response from these incompetent fascists. They do not care about veterans.\nThese community care are kids fresh out of college. Community Care really SUCKS!!!!!!!\nDo,you really expect Vets to believe this pack of lies? Trump just cut 37,000 VA jibs!!!!\nWell, you’ll be happy to know that a federal judge just ruled that no employees at the VA will be terminated. Those who have must be reinstated immediately. VA secretary Collins has lost all credibility with the veterans and really should step down.\nOn behalf of veterans everywhere, go fuck yourself.\nThe harm against Veterans has been going on since 1979, not just ten years!!! Will a female disabled Veteran be harmed, treated badly, and attempted lethal harm if she goes to the VA now? West Virginia VA treated me very well and cared about my health. But in other VA hospitals, there was way too much violent, destructive, intentional harm!!! Acting above the law like we don’t matter only certain ones. Never corrected, or those attacking Veterans never held accountable!!! Can we female Veterans, whistleblower Veterans, and Veterans that people don’t like to get to go to the VA without being harmed in any way? I hope so without people toying with our lives!!! Than you for being there for us!!!\nDear Sec Collins, Here is an email I sent out earlier today CONGRATULATING one of your employees but offering CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISMS/SUGGESTIONS to improve the services being provided by the VA FMP office to those of us who live/work outside the USA.\nDear Ms. Grace, (and Mr/Ms No Name Regional Office Director, CMS/VA Pittsburgh Regional Office (311)),\nMore great news!!! I received notification yesterday that the VA had been SUCCESSFUL in transferring my first payment from the VA ELECTRONICALLY. So, thank you once again, Ms. Grace, for making this happen so promptly!!! I hope that Sec Collins’ office has commended you on your outstanding CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!\nHOWEVER, consistent with the promises that Sec Collins made on 5 Feb 2025: https://news.va.gov/press-room/secretary-collins-message-to-veterans-and-va-employees/ still leaves me with more questions.\nWe’re going to deliver timely access to care and benefits for every eligible Veteran, family member, caregiver and survivor.\nWe’re going to put Veterans at the center of everything VA does, focusing relentlessly on customer service and convenience.\nWe’re going to challenge the status quo in order to find new and better ways of helping VA beneficiaries.\nWe’re going to celebrate the vast majority of VA employees who do a great job every day and hold employees accountable when they fall short of the mission.\nWe’re going to provide Veterans with the health care choices they have earned while maintaining and improving VA’s direct health care capabilities.\nIn the context of these promises, and given I am still holding Mr/Ms No Name Regional Office Director, CMS/VA Pittsburgh Regional Office (311) accountable for all these SNAFUS, given the original amount the VA transferred was $8,278.18 but the actual money credited to our account was only $8,139.08, I want to know WHY was I PENALIZED $139.10 (1.68%) when you were told originally that my preference was to use a dollar-dominated account? Does this meet the letter or intent of what Sec Collins has promised us? Is this what any Vet deserves for his/her service?\nimage.png\nSo here are the questions I am raising with the expectations that the yet-to-be-identified Regional Office Director, CMS/VA Pittsburgh Regional Office (311), will not only provide ANSWERS but will be PROACTIVE in making or facilitating the appropriate changes to bring the EXISTING policy and procedures in line to REFLECT the LETTER and INTENT of the COMMITMENTS Sec. Collins promised.\nQUESTIONS NEEDING ANSWERS AND CORRECTIVE/REMEDIAL ACTIONS from Mr/Ms. No Name Regional Office Director, CMS/VA Pittsburgh Regional Office (311) to meet the letter and intent of Sec. Collins promises:\n1) I originally provided a local USD dollar account with my local bank, but the VA informed me that they cannot/will not transfer to the dollar account, only to an Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) dominated account. Why should I, having provided my services to our country and now as a CUSTOMER of the VA, be expected to incur the risk of exchange rate fluctuations? Why have I been penalized $139.10 because the VA cannot/did not follow my original instructions?\n2) Why isn’t the VA ITEMIZING the payments? The VA paid $8,278.18, but how much of that was against the DISABILITY ($471.23 X 13 months = $5,482.49), and how much of that was REIMBURSEMENT of VA APPROVED payments for out-of-pocket medical expenses? ($29,775.06 through 23 Jan 2025) Without a detailed itemization showing what the VA FMP has paid and what you have not yet paid, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, for either you or us to manage the cash flows.\nAs noted, this email with attachments is being submitted on Sec Collin’s message page. https://news.va.gov/138326/va-secretary-doug-collins-veterans-benefits/#comment-827171\nThank you again!!\nBR,\nDr. PDG, Jakarta\nDr. Paul D. Giammalvo, CDT, CCE, MScPM, MRICS\nSenior Technical Advisor, PT Mitrata Citragraha\nYou will not get a response from those incompetent fascists. They do not care about veterans. Don’t believe their lies.\nYou are a liar.\nQuit lying and eat shit, trumpie.\nFuck you and fuck doge and fuck trump you fuckers. You have alienated queer veterans and you are fucking liars. Rot in hell where you belong. I hope this administration crashes and burns and takes all you supporters with it. Fucking traitors all of you. Piss off.\nWhy are our comments and questions on here being deleted? That just proves that the basic intent of the current VA administration is to manage what we hear and say in this forum because the administration is about to screw us out of our disability and benefits, While they swear they aren’t going to eliminate them. 80,000 firings will surely devastate veterans care and services.\nNo mention of a national day of rallies IN SUPPORT OF VETERANS… in state capitols.\nMarch 15, noon, GO to your state capitol please.\nOk chief I’m a 60% DV served in the Air Force so you say there is no cuts at the VA. So all the Veterans that they laid off is made up that’s why no one believes in the government anymore its just hurry up and wait BS. if you served you know what that means. How can anyone work for a person that has dodged service and made fun of veterans all the time. This fool lost my respect when he talked shit about Sen. John McClain and now he has a Nazi doing something about waste ok, where is the money that he has saved its are money tax payer money not the governments. God save the USA from these idiots.\nWhy are our comments and questions on here being deleted? That just proves that the basic intent of the VA is to manage what we hear and say in this forum because the administration is about to screw us out of our disability and benefits, While they swear they aren’t going to eliminate them.\nWhoever came up with your new log in system to my health vet, should be fired. It took me over an hour just to figure out how to sign in. Do you think a guy at my age could do this? Having to take numerous pictures of my driver’s license is just over the top. I had to take several pictures to get an approval. I am really upset with this nonsense. I am not a computer expert. What do you mean having to put in a website? Most people do not know their website.\nThat is what I would like to know. I haven’t been able to log in since December becuase of it.\nOk so it isn’t just me having this issue. Since late mid December I haven’t been able to log in. No matter what site I am sent to in order to correct the issue it fails.\nThank you for that information, my husband is 100% Vietnam vet,he also have PTSD,and agent orange disability.Glad to know he will be taking care of.We both are disable.I used to work for VA Hospital in the 1990’s and they were not good at all,a lot of messy people who was really mean, even before Trump was president,I had a hard time getting help from VA, and the hospital was awful, we had a hard time getting him approved for disibility.Still have a problem getting appointments and things he need,I hope things get better with Present Trump.\nI am so pleased that the Agent Orange claims. Will not end.\nI was exposed in the 1960s and now suffer from CLL leukemia.\nMy claim was opened in September of 2024. And I am in the process of submitting evidence of exposure.\nEdward N Peters\n[Editor: Do NOT publish your SSN or other personal information on the internet. I have removed it from your comment.]\nHe lied in Congress and he is still doing it. He is just another lying puppet MAGA MAGGOT!\nHe is a veteran\nDoesn’t matter; still a fascist traitor.\nBeing a veteran doesn’t automatically make you a good person. I’ve known many great people during my time in the service but also plenty of not so great people. I bet this new puppet is just as greedy and gluttonous as his master regardless of years of service. Stock up and get ready vets, I don’t see this ending without bloodshed on US soil.\nMy husband, Wayne A Pfuhl, was a US Army veteran and a retired police officer. His ashes were interred at the Ft Snelling National Cemetery in Minnesota on December 23, 2024. I placed a request for the Presidential Memorial Certificate for my husband to be signed by Donald J Trump. Can you advise if or when this request will be honored?\nGlad to hear this. but not convincing enough about Dodge. Dodge is BREAKING every law in its path, and he had not one word to say about that. He must be another Trump suck up.\nIf you are associated with Trump Administration, I don’t believe you.\nThat’s why you’ll always be a sheep.\nI hear Putin unzippig his fly. Line up to service him like a good tRumper. ?\nLick that boot, bow-n-scrap like a good tRumptard.\nSheep are the ones who don’t blindly follow something?\nAll this is confusing. I was trying to check my husband’s appointments on My Healthevet and got into this website. So many changes – they just changed the login procedures and now not sure what is happening. My husband uses Community Care for many appointments as getting appointments at the VA clinic was impossible or took months. Hopefully, the new Fredericksburg clinic will change that. It is very nice, but empty. As the speciality clinics are moved in I’m sure it will fill up. Most of the staff members are pleasant and do a good job. Mostly, the procedures for getting care could use some changes.\nWoundering why the VA clinic In Athens ohio will not put our president’s picture up .They had know problem putting Biden picture on the wall !!!\nI can’t stand looking at Trump, he is a criminal grifter.\nMR. Collins keep up the great work. I for one have had nothing but good experiences with the VA. There is a lot of hateful comments in this thread must be the Air Force. Keep up the good work, people need to relax and trust the process.\nwell, don’t expect those good experiences to continue as these cuts will result in fewer personnel to help with paperwork, doctors to find and treat illnesses, and facility maintenance personel.\nNext they will be requiring all disabled vets to be “re-assessed” under requirements that will push them out of care and into the streets. Trump doesn’t like losers that get captured or injured.\nfellas… fellas Much emotion discharged in all this commentary. BUT I FEEL YOU ALL! This battle for benefits is real for many a soldier who deserves what’s his… But for all the others who never proved themselves during their time of service, then shame on you for taking what’s not yours!\nAs for our new secretary, Doug Collins (and regardless of political orientation), we deserve to give this man the benefit of doubt but keep him in the “cross hairs” by measuring every word he says…. Verifying every promise he makes… Monitoring his deeds! And if he fails, let’s expose him then…. BUT if he performs and “does what he says he is going to do when he says he is going to do it”..then he deserves our praise and support.\nThat’s right fellas, lets grant this man the opportunity to prove himself battle ready.\nTime will ALWAYS either prove you or expose you!\nWhat the hell are you talking about. Does everyone who served have to receive a Purple Heart. I am USN and went to Nam and was washed over the side of my ship off the coast at 2 in the AM. We were pulling plane guard for the Midway. I served 3 tours, so bite ne. KMAMF.\nWhy would anyone trust him when he’s straight up lying to us?\nI am outraged that, as the purported leader of the VA, you are not doing everything you possibly can to disrupt and thwart this clear authoritarian plan to cut federal jobs, VA healthcare, and every other society-improving program that actually does good in this country. You should be ashamed of yourself, but it appears no one up there in the exec branch even has the ability to feel shame. So I am ashamed for you, and all those like you, who talk out of both sides of your mouth when trying to justify your actions. It’s reprehensible, and if you are not willing to lie down in front of the DOGE bulldozer for your constituency then you should just resign for principle and let someone more qualified and dedicated take the reins. Get out while you still have some semblance of a soul. Not that you ever did, by the looks of it.\ntrump hired him. Of course he’s a loyalist.\nI am completely shocked at the betrayal of this administration to its veterans. From mass firings across the federal government not based off performance of duties which affect numerous veterans to now cutting all their benefits and forcing the veterans around our nation who paid in blood t o have the bean counters turn their back on our veterans and have them suffer medically and possibly face homelessness is very disturbing and shameful. These actions will come full circle when all the veterans get a chance to vote this next go round and based off the above this administration is going to have to own this when the chips fall on them. So disgusting and shameful. May god have no mercy for these actions. I pray that we have no veterans die due to these actions.\nMr. Collins needs to crawl back into the hole he crawled out of. This is a privatization scheme. This is capitalism run amok. This is corruption in broad daylight. Someone’s going to have fat contracts and it won’t help the veteran. Traitors, all of you.\nDoug you are blue falcon , and a coward!! I bet you are receiving full benefits, while veterans are getting their taken away. Everyone sees through your lying Ass!\nWhy did you make a video to lie.? The cuts are posted on the Congressional Budget site. What is your problem? Can you read? I’m not sure you can because i am not sure you are qualified to hold the position.\nAs a service connected veteran I will be looking for a more streamlined VA system with better care. Staff that actually care about us the veterans.\nVa Secretary. Please stop acting incompetent. You have not been in office long enough to know what is or not good for the VA. Certainly letting Thousands go to any other means than Retirement is not being responsible or competent. Veterans signed a contract: Service Time and in return, life time treatment by VA. Not even you can or should try to do anything to derail such.\nYou took an oath of office. That Oath was not to a Man, King, Queen, Lunatic, or wannabe Dictator. The VA cannot afford to let anyone go without cause. Stop listening to Trump or anyone else.\nLiar.\nReduced service levels are just the first steps towards privatizing the VA.\nYou create a problem by cutting funding and service levels, and then say the solution is to privatize the system so the rich can get richer.\nComplete BS from this guy, he accepted slashing jobs in the VA. Then when people actually working at the VA say hey this is hurting us and hurting vets he goes on air and denies that lost jobs are causing issues. A total scumbag who will throw us all under the bus and rip away our benefits just to benefit himself and his masters.\nDoug Collins is the definition of a Bravo Foxtrot.\nRespectfully – This sounds like you’ve never called the public phone number for the VA. How is cutting your workforce going to make a vital and already understaffed department better able to help our Vets&their families? A huge percentage of VA workers are vets themselves, including disabled vets. Isn’t one of the goals to get Americans working? In past administrations when specific Fed jobs were deemed redundant the workers were retrained and given the opportunity for more efficient, needed jobs at equal if not higher pay. How is kicking these hard working Americans into the unemployment line pro-America? It seems like the ‘cuts ledger’ has only 1 side; these people (who’ve never served in the military, some of these kids are barely old enough to enlist) who are taking a slegehammer to the workforce seem to be (purposely?) neglectful of the future losses these cuts will cause. It can already take months for vets to be seen for therapy, medical care, job training etc. The faster our vets can get the benefits they need, to stay healthy and back to joining their families and communities, the better off for all of us. There are reports the VA Suicide Hotline is going to stop training because .. heaven forbid.. there are mentions of ‘LGBTQ’ in the training materials. While individuals are free to fear whoever they want the fact is LGBTQ people exist, there have always been LGBTQ Americans who have served our country. Shame on anyone trying to blame them for these ridiculous cuts -Turning your back not only on them, but on every other service member who is at the point of considering suicide is unconscionable. Please show what the US Military is supposed to stand for: protect our fellow Americans. Countries are not ‘businesses’ working to make profits for a handful of shareholders. The measure of ‘greatness’ isn’t a high profit margin. Stop selling out our veterans for a handful of businessmen who’ve never served and see those who did as ‘suckers’.\nI live in a rural area. We do not have local VA health care. This requires us to travel sometimes hours to get health care. I’m the last month travel pay has been turned over to a new agency that will not allow any contact from veterans and is denying my claims that have been verified valid requiring us to overload the appeal system to wait years to have valid claims paid while we suffer to obtain care so that someone in Washington can claim they are reducing fraud. There is no fraud here, when you can assign a contact number for vets to call in and review travel claim I will believe that you are not cutting. I have had 3 claims denied in the last month and need care. If you care, contact me… Then I will believe you aren’t blowing smoke.\nSure my stepdad been dead 3 yrs and still no grave marker.\nThen why Mr Secretary is the Legion having to push the Major Richard Star Act. Currently, combat-injured veterans face a reduction in their retirement pay for every dollar of disability compensation they receive. You lie. What’s next? Thank you for being another puppet in the Trump Musk Romper Room show. Resign sir.\nI find your videos to be absolutely arrogant and condescending. You do cheerleading for a POTUS who a 34x felon who DOES NOT respect vets. You say none of these haphazard cuts will affect healthcare but that is absolutely NOT TRUE and you know it. Stop lying! You KNOW the Veterans “Veterans Access Act” paves the way for pushing most and eventually ALL VA provided healthcare out into the Community so… Stop Lying (or hey, if you were unaware, see the assessment of this bill on Military.Com). You must be aware that there’s a GOP proposal to REDUCE VA disability payments by 30% once a disabled vet reaches 65.. right? Where are ya with that Mr. Doug? You’re also aware of the GOP proposal to reduce the healthcare services to those under 30% right Doug? Where are you with that? VA’s routinely SCORE HIGHER during Joint Commission audits than their civilian counterparts…. WHY Doug, would you want to dismantle a system proven to be better than outside hospitals? VA should be “the model” as their focus is on providing top-notch heath care rather than maximizing profit.\nAll those recent illegal firings now have the backing of a Federal Judge and have been ordered to be restored. Where were you for these employees? You just went along and broke the law… Then started spinning it. WHY? What is your motivation Doug? OPM’s now blaming the Agencies saying they never “ordered” you to do it… The OMB genius guy VOUGHT wants everyone traumatized. YOUR WORKFORCE is traumatized Doug… How do you expect a traumatized work-force to deliver top-notch care? How do you expect to attract and keep the best when YOU are literally terrorizing your staff and their families? Employees wont trust management for the next decade or longer and just how many of them are Vets that are being affected? You have to do better. If you cannot stand up to POTUS and his illegal actions, you aren’t fit to represent Veterans in OUR Affairs. If you are unable to tell the truth or do your job, please do the right thing and just resign. Right now you are absolutely tarnishing any legacy you might have had… The question is why? You ain’t no good ole boy, so stop with the bs ‘eh?\nWhere I am, my VA Doctor is the best doctor I’ve had. She is attentive, takes time to listen, and is very compassionate. She is leaving the VA because she is overwhelmed with the workload. The VA counselor I’ve been seeing for my PTSD is getting ready to leave because he is overbooked and sometimes double booked. I’m lucky if I get to meet with him once a month, (at my VA disability hearing I was instructed to see a therapist at least twice a month). There aren’t enough personnel to meet what is required. The pay is low, they get treated like robots, so they are leaving for the private sector. I have no idea how I’ll manage without my doctor and therapist. Getting hung out to dry after my service.\nI am not having fun or enjoying life as much today as the Veterans Association says their accounting records show I was overpaid by them a couple of years ago.\nI am told the Biden Administration and his Veteran System says I overpaid. The employee stated my old pension of $1413.00 a month would be $327.00 from now on. They reply,”there is nothing I can do about it as their accounting shows the proof. They never sent me any accounting or proof.\nThank god. I am 72 and get $1060.00 a month for social security. It was kind of a surprise for this old Vietnam veteran who is now having to live on $1387.00 a month.\nI just remember my old motto,”Things can only get better.” I am grateful though as I have God, family and you, my great friends in my life. I hate to post this but per the internet and on the Veterans sites it is an ongoing problem for over 50,000 veterans who are currently appealing this. Anyway, just wondering, can you help? Get the word out?\nThank you.\nJOHN BLANCHE/DBA ELVIS\nplease stop the cuts – you can’t cut your way to better health care. firing VA employees and reinvesting the savings doesn’t make sense. Government employees provide better service than contractors and in most cases at less cost.\nBlaming the press for news about significant cuts in VA personal is bogus. We veterans are not stupid. The fact that thousands of people are in fact being cut from the VA employee rolls (including veterans) is bound to have a detrimental effect on the delivery of benefits.\nAnd you did not address the question of whether Musk and his team of slash and burn expertise executioners will have, or do already have, access too our personal information. Instead you spoke about their reviewing contracts These actions are extremely worrisome to me and many others like me.\nIn this day and age, when “retribution” seems to be the operative word, I may be sticking my neck out by posting these comments, but as a conscious veteran I feel compelled to speak my piece, which I assume is still permitted in this great country!\nI retired from the Army in May of 1995. I didn’t apply for any disability rating until 17 years after I retired. My experience through out this entire time has been that the VA operates in a 3 word doctrine , Discourage, Delay and Deny. I watched as my neighbor who was a decorated Vietnam veteran of the 1st Cavalry Division kept applying for a disability rating for years due to combat wounds and Agent Orange exposure and after 5 years of trying he was awarded a whopping 0% disability rating. He passed away 2 years ago. I am rated at 70% currently but should be higher . My question for you sir is : Who sits on these revue boards and what qualifications due they have to make these decisions ? From some of claims that have been denied I think they are just unqualified people who can’t see the obviousness of why some claims are submitted. Please look into this ! I would also like to add that wait times for appointments at the Floyd Lindstrom VA clinic in Colorado Springs is way to long as it also is at the Rocky Mountain Regional Medical Center in Aurora Colorado. The excuse they both use is lack of staffing . When I ask for community care because the wait times are so long it takes another long period before you get an authorization. When there is an issue with getting a response from someone for anything and you contact a patient advocate, it takes sometimes 10 days to get a response from the. and just today I received an email from the the VA western Colorado health system that the Patient Advocate office hours are now limited again due to staffing issues. PLEASE FIX THIS !!\nWhy has the Indianapolis Radabush VA Hospital project to build a new Hospital been put on Hold??\nPlease assure us that The PACT Act will remain intact. We fear that laws passed by the previous administration will be targeted for DOGE scrutiny and removal. My husband is a “Bluewater Vet.” His Parkinson’s Disease and dementia are related to his Navy service in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam era, and we are grateful for the financial assistance provided by the PACT Act for his increasing need for care. Respectfully,\nThe out sourcing of disabilty claims is a nightmare for Veterans in many cases. Secretary Collins VA has our records. Many of us have records on file tha VA can provide by contacting a non VA intermediary. They often don’t have the Veterans records and the ask the veteran to to do the leg work in acquiring the records on their own. That can be beyond the capabilities of many us and a valid claim of a veteran may bo by the wayside and may be denied. Thiscan be simplified by VA keeping outside services who are I’ll equipped to provide proper service to the veteran. The want us to travel to their arranged places for tests. Many times they are many miles from our homes. When we have VA facilities in our local communities. I just had serious brain surgery and can not travel to locations for An EEG and another for an EKG and another for an XRAY and another for a psychiatric exam. This is out of control when all of these tests are in the VA records already. The aneurysm claim is linked to my service disability for high blood pressure. I need my claim to be expedited and granted 100% due to unemployability. I can not work with all of the issues that I have. This is not unique many of my fellow veterans are in this maze of VA red tape. I will assure you my local VA Clinic is outstanding but VA disability benefits go to outsourcing for further testing. Not necessary. This needs to get to VA Secretary Collins desk.\nI want the medical services at a VA Health care facility. Stop sending veterans to the private sector unless they specifically ask for that. Reducing staff means you’ll be trying to force veterans out of the VA health care system and into the private sector again. Stop denying it and stop doing it.\nThank you for saying this part. This has been my experience with the VA since 2020 and I hate it. When the VA was forced to use the private sector due to the CARE Act, I ended up being lost, forgotten and ignored by the private sector with the VA being unwilling to intervene. I’ve been without care for 5 years now. It took me years to get in to now have nothing and no faith in the system.\nGlad I left my VA job then too because I would’ve been fired for sure.\nThanks, Trump for fucking me and many other Vets over them and continuing to fuck us now, you Russian traitor. How the hell has any of what Trump has done has been good for us Vets?\nPlease partner with habitat for humanity to provide homes to vets. There are thousands of abandoned houses across the nation that they could refurbish and give to homeless vets\nI truly agree with this. It saddens me to see our boys in the streets… wondering about with a million thoughts in their minds…. No mission….no battle buddies….HOMELESS!\nI will personally work on this! Not via HUD and their red tape protocolos and policies, but via the private sector. I am designing $30,000 handicap-ready compact homes that can be built on a large track of land as cluster homes and be financed via our VA home loan benefits.\nIn essence, these will be Communities for vets only.\nMr. Collins\nAs Secretary of the VA, your job is to fight for Veterans Benefits rather than just accept the loss of 80,000 jobs. If you plan to just accept this loss you should resign.\nChet Hebble\nI will be asking the VFW,DAV , American Legion , Vietnam veterans of America, and all veterans groups to appeal to DOGE not to destroy the improvements that President Trump made in his first term in office. As someone who has personally dealt with downsizing of a organization I can understand the hard choices we need to make by contributing to the National Debt. I will be asking that Veterans Administration do a Four percent reduction in force for the first year 2025, Then five percent in 2026 . The total distruption of the Veterans Administration is not needed or necessary.\nYou are piece of crap Mr Collins. You and your drug addled south African asshole and go jump off a bridge. Its pretty clear that you, POTUS, and all republicans could care less about VETs.\nGO piss up a rope you fascist.\nDon your comments to Mr. Collins are totally uncalled for. I hope you don’t always have this attitude.\nHe has only been in the job three weeks. Your nasty post should of been deleted…………………………….\nGOLD STAR WIFE\nWhile your intentions sound good, why should anyone believe what you are telling us now? Trump and Musk are cutting things daily and the VA was already short. While the contention is that nothing will change for us Veterans, there have been too many lies, changes, etc., coming from the top, on a regular basis. Why should anyone trust you when you take your directions from these same unreliable people? With short staff already in place and open positions, cutting will only contribute to decreased care and less top notch providers.\nYOU ARE A FASCIST TRAITOR. I SEE A CHAPLAIN AND A VET. WHAT? A SINNER AS WELL.IT DOES NOT EVEN HAVE ENOUGH EMPLOYEES.I HOPE TO GOD YOU ARE NOT A FAMILY MAN.YOU ARE A HUMILIATING EMBARRASSMENT TO THE COUNTRY GOOD LUCK GOING OUT IN PUBLIC YOU WILLBE MORE HUMILIATED. God is watching you\nAs the saying goes: You can fool all the people some of the time and You can fool some of the people all of the time but you can’t fool all of the people all the time. Unfortunately you may be fooling enough of the people in the short term. I’m waiting to see improvements to the system not its demise. In the short term you may find yourself to be the bureaucrat hearing “YOU ARE FIRED”, And it may not even be your fault. You may not have been able to find enough fraud and abuse or at least to say that you have. There will be no next comment. I am a registered independent voter. A veteran who has thus far been treated fairly and respectfully by the VA. What is going on now does not have the appearance of fairness. Why call for balancing the budget while at the same time asking for tax cuts? Show some common sense first make progress on the deficit and come back in two years to get paid for any progress made.\nSelf promoting political hackery. Not a word is sincere or believable. The current VA secretary has no intention of honoring commitments made to veterans. I recently had a visit to the ER at a VA medical center, and the nursing staff is freaking out. How does frightening and overworking medical staff improve veteran care?\nIt is sad and embarrassing to see the comments from the free loaders that did nothing to earn the benefits talking crap based on their mistaken political beliefs. Grow up and get a job instead of expecting handouts. They should cut the benefits for all that didn’t serve in combat or do a full 20. No more welfare for the lazy.\nGary, I served 20 years, and in 2 combat locations. I dont expect handouts. I am not a free loader. DID YOU????\nIt pisses me off that this Administration full of draft dodgers and notorious for disrespectful comments about veterans are now in charge, what a mess. YOU SIR NEED TO REEVALUATE YOUR COMMENTS OR MOVE BACK TO RUSSIA, YOU FIT RIGHT INTO THE TRUMP MINDSET> .\nGary, KMA and lick trumps boots.\nCombat does not happen with all of the support people also in boots—Medical corpsman here—was medical staff on the ground back home in hospitals that serve those who come back also important to you. Maybe that view from your high horse needs to adjust. We were ALL important in our jobs so that you could do yours.\nI have the upmost respect for Dog Collins. I listened to his video presentation and it left me with more questions than answers. As a service connected veteran, not 100%, I have been able to access the on base recreational facilities for camping with my family and guest for the last several years. We recently reserved camping sites as before and paid the necessary fees. A week or so later I received a call from veterans services on base that the regulations have changed and the benefits have been restricted to veterans with 100% disability and of course the normal active duty, retired, and reserve. The Service Connected veterans with less than 100% disabilities have lost some of their benefits. I would like clarification please. Thank you.\nHow much money does the VA spend on promo items like pen sets, coin purses drink coolers and MANY OTHER ITEMS FRIG MANEGNETS A TPON OF CRAP?\nHey, Comrade Collinski…I hate it when someone pisses on my leg and tells me it’s raining out. And I hate it more when it’s a Trump ass-kisser doing it. Do everyone a favor and keep your lies to yourself.\nSecretary Collins:\nCutting 82,000 jobs will indeed cut our benefits. This proposed cut is not a media fantasy, it exists in an official memo–and you know that.\nI am a Purple Heart Combat Veteran, and I want you to know that the VA provides excellent health care with its very limited resources. The VA has been running on a reduced budget already, so it cannot absorb a slashing of 82,000 personnel and still provide benefits we now have. Wait times will further degrade. My local facility has already eliminated paid reception and desk jobs and replaced them with unpaid volunteers. There is no slack.\nPlease honor your pledge to ensure our VA will continue to provide good health care. Go to bat for us.\nVa has been trying to get the iu and they are trying take away after 67 will the 200.000 over 67 will get the shaft and loose loss what states provide. Like home tax, free fishing licenses and much more Texas will give no home tax relief for my wife if i die. I am 82 years old and it want long before I will die .\nYou piece of garbage! You, trump, musk and vance are ALL GARBAGE!!!!\nMaybe you should have done something and served in the real military rather than talk crap.\nSecretary Collins,\nIn your video, you stated, “I’m happy to partner with them to find things we need to get rid of so we can put the money where it belongs… back with our Veterans,”\nFirst, you must rely on the outstanding professionals in the VA’s Office of the Inspector General. Those folks know what they seek, honed by years of collective experience in the organization. They, not some group of uncleared people unfamiliar with the working and, often, legally required processes of the VA, are the BEST to continue their diligence in finding better ways to carry on the VA mission. They are your most valuable resources for improving the VA and investigating and uncovering fraud and corrupt practices. Further, your statement “…find things we need to get rid of…” speaks volumes about someone with very little experience in the processes involved. The key to gaining efficiency and effectiveness is not to “get rid of” but to find ways to IMPROVE the quality and the processes that help achieve the mission. As long as your “partners” try to trash the system they don’t understand, there can never be acceptable change for the better.\nAt first, 1400 probationary VA employees were fired. And, now, you recently announced another 80,000 to be fired. How do you expect the VA to better assist Veterans, especially in areas like getting appointments more rapidly if you are firing the people who answered the phones? You must realize that the people you call partners, including the president, do not have the best interests of Veterans in mind – he has already called us “suckers” and “losers.” And, from everything I have you say, you don’t care about veterans either. You better get this straight: we are neither. We have defended our nation against threats like this before and will again. We are Veterans, and we Vote. We had a term for “shipmates” like you, Bravo Foxtrot. So far, you have earned it.\nGer Elon Musk OUT OF THE VA. He doesnt care about VETERANS. NO PRIVATIZATION\nOH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just noticed your disclaimer that whatever a Veteran post, the post is going to be changed to more moderate wording. To that I say what I post is my 1st amendment right, so hand off the wording…………………..\nDam!!!, I cannot believe you took the time to make another video with NO Factual basis (all lies). I am 80 years old, Disabled Vietnam Veteran, and your good old boy down home speaking is as phony as the word coming out of your mouth. The V.A. clinic where I go for healthcare has a hard time servicing all of the Veteran who need help due to MUSK and Trump cuts. The more you cut employees the Longer and longer it is going to be to schedule an appointment for care. Not enough Doctors, nurses or medical folks with the right expertise to care for Veteran’s needs. I believe MUSK and TRUMP would rather have all of the Veteran who served this Great Country Die off rather than help them with their healthcare. I guess you don’t remember what NON-MILITARY (draft dodger) said about the Navy Hero Senator McCain. Trump doesn’t RESPECT him because he got CAPITURED, Tortured, something he or Musk will never experience…………..\nI just want to know, why is it that the first thing every party, democrats and republicans always wants to cut veterans benefits and social security??? I would think the kickbacks being taken away from the politicians would pretty much take care of the deficit, wouldn’t you agree??\nPlease secure jobs for the healthcare providers at the VA. These GREAT folks are overwhelmed with veterans requiring their services. It would benefit our veterans if you could increase the number of healthcare workers and decrease the number of bureaucrats (most of whom are quite useless). In fact the folks at the Wisconisin Evidence Intake Center have NO idea what they are doing when it comes to Vietnam Navy Veterans. These people cannot even determine longitude and latitude on a map when determining where a ship was stationed according to the ship’s deck logs. This puts our Navy Vets at a disadvantage when applying for benefits. Please Mr. Secretary sort out this bureaucratic MESS!!! Thank You\nYou overwhelmingly voted for a reduction in EVERYTHING, so stop whining. Trump was correct when he said veterans are a bunch of suckers.\nCollins, you are lying. Stop lying to veterans!! We have been betrayed. Lincoln made promises when he created the Veterans administration to care for those that shouldered the burden of this country’s wars. Trump, DOGE and Elon Musk are bragging about cuts. Trump has never respected us. He calls us suckers. He says he has no respect for POW’s because they are losers for getting captured. He doesn’t want the most injured of us all to be brought out at public events. We remember. I will never forget this country’s betrayal. I used to take great pride in serving my country. No longer.\nI have been dealing with the VA sense I retired in 1998. The past month VA help has been better than the past 20 years. I got a referral that I needed for back issues I have had for worn out hip joints from running 5 miles a day while in the military.\nI see many posts on this site condemning the new administration. Most are unhinged. With nothing more than Ad Hominem attacks on a man they never met. Whom they hate, with a hate a demon would be proud of. Not even willing to hear the truth, but are influenced by a political party that would leave them to die on the battle field just like in Benghazi, Libya in 2012, or Abby Gate in 2021.\nThank you Mr Collins for taking control of a broken health care system for us veterans that in the past would allow us to die in pain rather than give us the treatments we earned for our service. May God be your guide and give you his wisdom and strength to write the ship that was left to list in the mothball grave yard.\nVeteran care is being impacted already.\nAlong with many of the previous comments I don’t believe anything you say. You are allowing a draft dodger who knows nothing about military service and is known to badger and insult military people make decisions on something as important as our veterans, he is getting rid of the pact act for revenge my husband gave up so much and is now a 100% disabled. I can not express how disgusted I am with this administration\nDOGE wants to fire as many as 80,000 VA workers. How does this not impact Veterans who receive care at facilities around the country that are being threatened with closure and the loss of workers? Providing easy to access care to our Veterans is part of their benefits we the people (via our government including our Presidents) promised to them, is it not?\nAll we ask for is the earned return for our signature that’s it nothing more nothing less.\nHe’s a liar. It’s been a right wing project for decades to defund VA until it barely functions. Then they complain about how it’s too big a bureaucracy and it’s failing vets. This is all in an effort to give the medical contacts to their wealthy friends. The VA is the only public healthcare in this country, and it is much beloved, so they have to destroy it. Hands off VA!\nYOU’RE JUST SPOUTING THE PARTY LINE! TIME WILL TELL THE REAL TRUTH.\nMr. Secretary,\nThe biggest issue I see with the current mandate to cut jobs is that it focuses solely on reducing headcount rather than improving efficiency or service quality. If the goal were truly to streamline operations, the mandate should focus on identifying inefficiencies within the department—many of which appear to be intentional. The VA routinely slows the processing of claims and services, seemingly as a cost-saving measure. By creating delays, veterans are forced to wait for care, which in turn reduces the VA’s immediate financial obligations.\nA personal example: My therapist switched practices, and I requested that my authorization be transferred to the new location. Despite providing all necessary information immediately, Community Care first authorized the original practice instead. When I pointed out the mistake, they canceled my authorization entirely. Then, only after I followed up multiple times, I was told there was a two-month backlog for new authorizations. A simple administrative change took four months to resolve, during which my mental health deteriorated. I can only imagine what happens to veterans with more severe conditions who lack the ability to advocate for themselves.\nTo make matters worse, I was informed that this authorization was intended to close my need for therapy. That decision should not be made by bureaucrats—it should be between me and my therapist. Given the lasting impact of my military service, I will likely need mental health support for the rest of my life.\nIf the VA is serious about reducing waste, it should start by identifying policies and procedures that seem intentionally designed to create bureaucratic delays in services. These inefficiencies do not just inconvenience veterans—they actively harm those in need of care. Additionally, the VA should conduct audits to identify deceased veterans whose benefits are still being paid, preventing unnecessary financial loss without restricting care for the living.\nThe current approach to cost-cutting prioritizes hitting a number over people. It’s time to focus on real reform.\nAdditionally, another approach to improving efficiency and accountability in military and veteran affairs would be to consolidate the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) budget into the Department of Defense (DoD) budget. Instead of the VA receiving a separate allocation, a designated percentage of the DoD’s total budget could be earmarked for veteran care.\nCurrently, VA funding is a little over 41% of the DoD’s budget. Setting a benchmark of 40% as a starting point would save approximately $5 billion, while still maintaining strong veteran support. This shift would place greater responsibility on the DoD to prioritize the long-term health and well-being of service members, ensuring that decisions made during active duty do not create unnecessary burdens on the VA system later.\nAdditionally, this reform would introduce accountability mechanisms within the DoD. Right now, the DoD operates with virtually no financial checks and balances, as any effort to reduce or restructure its budget is often framed as being anti-military. By tying VA funding directly to the DoD’s budget, poor decision-making or inefficiencies within the military would have real financial consequences, forcing leadership to be more strategic about both spending and personnel policies.\nOf course, there would also need to be a separate accountability mechanism for the VA to ensure that the reallocation of funds results in better, not worse, services for veterans.\nI previously submitted similar ideas to the White House for consideration by the Department of Governmental Operations and Efficiency (DOGE), along with an offer to volunteer my expertise as a BA and MBA-educated veteran honor student. Unfortunately, I received no response. You have my name Mr. Secretary, I’m the only one I know of, feel free to have someone contact me.\nWould be even better if you didn’t reduce the benefits for a 100% disabled veteran because YOU made a mistake and paid me $1600 too much educational benefits when we’re sending money to every country, known and unknown, to pay for:\n* $1.5 million to “advance diversity equity and inclusion in Serbia’s workplaces and business communities”\n* $70,000 for production of a “DEI musical” in Ireland\n* $2.5 million for electric vehicles for Vietnam\n* $47,000 for a “transgender opera” in Colombia\n* $32,000 for a “transgender comic book” in Peru\n* $2 million for sex changes and “LGBT activism” in Guatemala\n* $6 million to fund tourism in Egypt\n* Hundreds of thousands of dollars for a non-profit linked to designated terrorist organizations — even AFTER an inspector general launched an investigation\n* Millions to EcoHealth Alliance — which was involved in research at the Wuhan lab\n* “Hundreds of thousands of meals that went to al Qaeda-affiliated fighters in Syria”\n* Funding to print “personalized” contraceptives birth control devices in developing countries\n* Hundreds of millions of dollars to fund “irrigation canals, farming equipment, and even fertilizer used to support the unprecedented poppy cultivation and heroin production in Afghanistan,” benefiting the Taliban\nBut good on you taking back $100 from me every month\nI appreciate what you said in your video. I have 3 claims that have been in limbo for months. Just trying to get the disability rating I deserve is a task I shouldn’t have to fight. I served in Desert Storm and Somalia (PACT ACT) and keep getting denied. Please fix that. It’s been months on these claims and they haven’t moved. DOGE needs to get involved with that aspect. People like Marc in his rude statement, should not be listened to. I’m a proud Veteran and I appreciate you. Thank you, sir.\nDeleting veterans comments because you dislike the words is not going to change the outcome for those that steal our benefits. Don’t forget who trained us and what we were trained for a$$clowns.\nYou were an election denier who signed his name to a brief seeking to overturn a free and fair election. No facts in that brief just made up hog wash.\nNow you are head of the VA appointed by Trump. You got your payback for supporting him.\nYou should be ashamed of supporting that lie on the record.\nFiring VA staff for no reason will only hurt veterans.\nEvery time I go to the VA I now have to avoid looking at your picture as well as Trumps.\nThere is no reason to be nasty to Mr.Collins.He has only been in the job a couple of weeks. Totally disrespectful.\nGold Star Wife\nGet off your knees and grow a spine. It’s unbelievable how a coward like you can actually run Veteran’s Affairs.\nMr Collins thank you for your post and video. I am a Air Force veteran from the 60’s and over all the VA has been good to me. However I hope you will look at the VA billing system which in my opinion is in great need to be upgraded, I am on a copay for some things and the way the VA handles this is a total mess. Just have someone check my account and it should be oblivious. I am treated out of the Columbia MO VA.I would be more thank happy to talk to someone about this. Thanks John\nYou miserable asshat! All you are is a “Tool” for an “Orange Painted” fool of a fascist. Your plans will harm those who you say, that you are there to serve. Grow a Spine!\nWow! A *lot* of comments here! Just wanted to say that I’ve been dealing with VA since ’76 and realistically in the past 6 years or so has it been consistently great for me. But now I can imagine which services are going to be axed, delayed and impaired with cuts… And basically cuts just for the sake of cuts (with a sword not scalpel), without actually looking at and identifying areas that could be cut, or further improved for matter. I hate to say it but it feels like, “hey let’s do what Elon’s doing because, hey, he’s the richest man in the world” even though helping veterans who served their country is far cry from buying satellite and rocket companies.\nSadly, I have noticed a slow down with processing claims Since the election, I am a supporter of President Trump but I think there’s been a mistake at the VA and it’s gonna cost all of us pain. We cannot even ask for a projected date for the resolution of one’s claim. Normally it would take about 45 days to approve or disapprove a claim now I am at 60 days in step number two and Fear that there will be no definite time resolution it could go on for months or years. I’m losing confidence in the system. This is very scary at 71 years old now I don’t have a lot of time. And from reading the comments below from my brothers, it appears that I’m not alone, the secretary remember is a politician first. So it appears that these cuts at the VA are in fact impacting veterans in a negative way. That’s why I came to read these comments one can only come to the conclusion that we as veterans are going to be hurt. How sad.\nThis administration gives a ratsass about veterans. Hell, the Dictator in Chief called us losers.\nWe will pay the bill for our votes.\nReally Johnny? So that’s why POTUS DJT started the Veteran Crises Hot Line in his first 4 years? Giving us Veterans a hotline to call if we need help. Maybe you should stop watching the paid for media outlets like CNN and MSNBC.\nYou actually believe that Trump created the VA helpline? The suicide prevention line? He did not. I worked in the field. Trump created nothing but problems for the active duty and now veterans. Those lines are not the work of Trump. Anything having to do with mental health related lines were already in practice. He takes credit for others’ work.\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs established the Veterans Crisis Line in 2007 as a 24/7 resource to provide confidential help to veterans and their loved ones in need of support.\nIn 2022, the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline transitioned from the standard 10-digit phone number to the more recognizable 3-digit number, 988.\nTo reach the Veterans Crisis Line, callers can now dial 988 and press 1. The line is accessible through call, text, or chat.\nThe intent of this shift was to make the phone number for the Lifeline easier to remember and more accessible for people who need immediate crisis support.\nJerry the veterans crisishotline has been going since 2007 you couldn’t be more wrong\nSo, what did you think he was going to do while you watched him lie to the American people? Then you voted for him. You are a fool for believe his lies!!! The Bible warns of increasing lies and deception in the “last days,” with passages like 2 Timothy 3:1-9 describing a time of moral decay and a strong delusion where people will reject truth and embrace falsehoods.\nIn 2000, DOD and VA conspired to drive off grass roots groups. We used\nto be invited to Pentagon briefs. But, with the creation of Deployment\nHealth – only members of the military family alliance that were chartered\nby Congress were allowed to attend any more. Service groups were fine\nwith this. Less disruptions. Less to compete with. DOD cuts us off.\nBy 2002, DOD slowly started to also cut off the service groups from certain\nevents as well. Limiting access to information. By 2003, all were distracted\nwith OIF OEF.\n2004, Deployment Health did all it could to pad, and hide any medical problems\nsurfacing from Afghanistan, Iraq. West Nile Virus, Acinetobacter Baumannii,\nVisceral and Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, and IED as well as EOD injury issues.\nBy 2005, VA no longer allowed grass roots upstairs to meet with staff. Only\nservice groups. Service groups were fine with this. IOM / NIH began cutting off\ngrassroots and service groups from its workshops.\nBy 2010, VA started driving away the service groups. Not briefing them on\ncertain things. As did DOD. Sec of VA Eric Shinseki had grudge matches with\nanyone publishing news or materials he didnt approve. Then he resigned\nin disgrace.\nBy 2012 VA and DOD actively started removing advocates from committees\nand functions. Started rigging VA committees with internal ringers that would\nnot publish, seeking out congress, or rock the boat. Media started writing less\nand less veteran stories.\n2016 would be the last serious batch of veteran related congressional hearings.\nCongress no longer wanted the service groups and limited them to there\nbudget proposals in the spring. After this, it was mostly OEF and OIF till the\nPACT act became necessary.\n2021 came along, Covid let VA and DOD keep every one at bay. Limit meetings\nto video conference. Stopped answering phones. Now media is on board and\nno longer writing veterans stories. Cutting VSOs out as well. Google started\nblocking any websites that said anything harsh about VA and DOD.\n2024, VA started removing public comments from its meetings and ignored\nany still up. VA stopped writing anyone outside of VA that wasnt part of\nthe inner circle. Openly opposing the service groups. No one was welcome\nupstairs and the dont have to answer phones, email.\n2025, Trump and Elon step in to take advantage of this vacuum to gut most\nagencies, and with VA disregard for veterans – there is no loyalty. So no job\nis secure and everyone is threatened. Your public comments here are largely\nangry veterans spewing at you with no loyalty. You may have a few ringers\non the inside still supporting you, yes men, its not enough to stop the wave\nof cuts coming. because there is no unification across the boards.\nThis all started with DODs need to hide in plain sight, and lump all wars into\nthe Deployment Health catch all. Make everything generic. Seems like now is\nthe time to team up with all sides, eras, and the service groups like it was\nbefore DOD undermined all this. Strength in numbers. Now is a good time\nto post a public voting format within VA of what its veterans want. Instead\nof telling them what they want.\nKeep the current path, it all ends in chaos. Stop insulting people, keep things\nsimple – and just provide the service you supposed to minus the games. At\nleast with this purge at VA, you will unite people alright – an angry mob that\nyou betrayed protesting in unison in front of your doors. The elitist days of\nsnobs looking down on the public is about to unravel. More of the same\nand worse failed. Each angry vet created is for a lifetime, and dont think they\njust plan to keep taking this. Millions betrayed, Im so thrilled Im not you.\nThank you for breakdown.\nSecretary Collin’s, I hate to see anyone lose their jobs but the answer to the problem isn’t quantity of people, it’s quality of people. My amazing VA primary care doctor retired and was replaced by a provider who personally insulted me the first time she saw me and has treated me like garbage. Now shdoes not want me for a patient and I don’t go to the doctor even when it is needed. I suffer daily! we have a beautiful new facility here in Columbus GA but I’m not sure what the purpose of building it was. It appears to be a big empty building.\nI am grateful for t he OUTSIDE care I get from the VA. Seeing outside providers is the only way I get quality care except for mental health care I receive. Why can’t I see someone outside the VA for primary care?\nIf you are going to reduce the VA work force by 83,000 employees. That means that 82,000 veterans will loose their jobs.\nAs a veteran, how is that supposed to be OK with me?\nAbsolutely Trump propaganda!! DOGE, project 2025 & Trump’s entire agenda is anti American, anti democracy, pro Russia & meant to advance the mega rich. Cutting the VA workforce by %20 (70,000) is not advancing the mission, it’s sabotaging the delivery of services to veterans. Musk/DOGE could start by eliminating the waste & abuse in Musk’s numerous billion dollar government contracts. You are part of Trump’s “revenge/retribution administration. We are not fools. Those who speak out I’m sure will be targeted by Trump’s administration.\ni have being trying to fight the VA for over 18 years and the only goal for the VA is to see us die and never get our entitlements. Sadly the VA is not here to help us Veterans but to impede us from getting help, aid and ensure that many of us never get our entitlements. I have seen many brothers and sisters die because the doings of the criminal organization known as the VA. I have being trying to disability retire from my current job but all can only be attainable if i ever get my 100% total and perm but even as my law firm fights for me, I still do not see the light because the criminal organization known as the VA will do anything to ensure we vets never get our entitlements and just die to completely push us away.\nMyself and many of my brothers at arms have been fighting the VA for years due to the VA denying everything illegally, unlawfully and simply in spite. I personally have being fighting the VA over 18 years and they illegaly remove % for our records to lower our profiles. after many years and many law firms i was able to get a 90% because they denied many ailments that where proved to began while in service but they have continue to deny myself and many of our brothers and sisters our rights. I was even downgraded illegaly to 80% without no appt, no proof or anything.\nWhen I left the military in 2007 I have no idea what i needed to do with the VA because nobody ever helped me or guided me to what my entitlements were, i had no idea. So since then i have been fighting this uphill battle. I have helped dozens of vets so they do not have to go through what i have been going thru for almost 20 battle. and thankfully most have been able to get their entitlements assigned properly due to getting out prepared and with good guidance.\nI am pursuing disability retirement from my current job due to my ailments but finally receiving my 100% total and permanent that I deserve is imperative and hopefully my current law firm will be able to finally.\nThe VA is supposed to be here to help us Veterans but they are only here to hurt us and worse.\nYou are a LIAR!!\nHell yeah he is. He must think we’re stupid.\nI’m a disable Vietnam vet and have been dealing with the VA since the early 70s.\nAll I can say about Secretary Collins’ “kicking the can” message is that it’s just more self serving BS from the Draft Dodger in Chief and his MAGA minions.\nThe VA has always been chronically understaffed, underfunded, and overwhelmed by requests for care so how is removing 1000s of employees, many of them veterans, along with programs and funding going to help anything or anybody, let along improve things?\nThe plain truth is that it’s not and if Sec. Collins goes along with this farce it just proves that he’s more interested in keeping his place at the tax payer funded feed trough than he is in helping veterans.\nAll you boot lickers are disgusting.\nStop by Doug Collins office, make him tell you to your face that he supports cutting 80k VA jobs.\n810 Vermont Avenue, NW\nWashington, DC 2042\n#VeteransRally\nI’m decorated, injured and former member of socom with full benefits, and have NEVER had an issue with my benefits or staff. Yes, there’s been a few messups but always resolved. We as veterans earned benefits and should greatly appreciate what we get. The members of other agencies who also put in work have often gotten none. Can it be inproved? Always !!!! It hasn’t even been 2 months. Breathe in people.\nWhile I am not in the same league at 60%, I also have had the best care at the VA for my SC injuries. However, I do not want to wait while my fellow veterans are harmed by the actions by this political appointee Collins. He does not appear to speak truth.\nCentral to these efforts is a pragmatic and disciplined approach to eliminating waste and bureaucracy, increasing efficiency and improving health care benefits and services to veterans,” said Collins. Collins is in support of cutting VA health care workers. He is a fake Jesus loving liar. He will need increased security\nArmy veteran.\nI listened to your comments on “making the VA more efficient”.\n70k job losses….are NOT the way you make the VA more efficient.\nMy suggestion? Check yourself into a VA mental ward.\nOoooh my mistake…the wait will increase from 6 months to 2 years to see a doctor with your cuts in VA.\nJust lunacy.\nWhy is the va allowed to use there own math when dealing with veterans disabilities I happen to be 100 percent disabled but va math makes it 70 percent to me this is a huge slap in the face of veterans who put there lives on the line then find out the very agency that is supposed to be helping veterans comes up with this formula I am not naive they use this tool to save money off the backs of those who have sacrificed themselves I would love to new secretary to address this issue.\nThanks\nSo please explain to me why I’m still a homeless veteran trying to deal with SSVF or VASH and human beings that should not be working in Customer Service or social work in Sacramento CA.\nJust saw this liar on PBS. “Veterans benefits aren’t being cut”.\nWhere does Trump find these dumb hicks to run his government?\nWho is this joker…?\nDOGE needs to focus on the top and work its way down. Why don’t they first look at how much The White House spends daily? Or why in 2000 we had a surplus and now in the trillions in debt. Hmm could it have been that we were in two conflicts for almost two decades. It was ridiculous the amount of money spent there. Why don’t they look at how much we spent on defense contracts all those years. Or maybe we increased our force during those times for the surges. Why haven’t we drawn down the force? It was done after Vietnam and first Gulf War. DOGE is focusing on making the rich richer and the poor poorer. I defended my country for 21 years active duty with multiple deployments. Is this what our country has become, full of lies from the top down? If each person in our Nation could do one kind act WE the people would become a Great Nation Again.\nHey 1sg, Newsflash, in 2000 the United states didn’t have a surplus. Check your facts before you spew bullshit.\nHow about you get the fact Cpt. Clueless.\nn 2000, the United States federal government had a budget surplus of $236.9 billion, the largest in U.S. history at the time. This was the third consecutive year of a surplus.\nDetails\nThe total revenue for 2000 was $2,025 billion, an increase of $197.7 billion from 1999\nThe total outlays for 2000 were $1,788.1 billion, an increase of $85.2 billion from 1999\nThe surplus was 2.4% of the gross domestic product (GDP)\nThe surplus was the largest as a share of the economy since 1948\nOther budget highlights\nThe surplus was the result of the Clinton administration’s economic policies\nThe surplus was the result of a $363 billion reduction in the publicly held debt between 1998 and 2000\nThe surplus was the result of eight consecutive years of fiscal improvement\nAdditional information\nThe federal budget for 2000 was a spending request submitted by President Bill Clinton to fund government operations for the period from October 1999 to September 2000.\nDear Secretary Collins,\nIn your recent X post, you said the word duplicative. Please consider this: When a veteran is considered for benefits, the VA will send the member to a VA-sanctioned vendor to confirm the disability. Why do this when the member was already tasked to have a certified MD acknowledge the condition via a Nexus letter. Are the physician’s credentials, words, and signature stamps not worthy of acknowledgment of the condition?\nAnother cost-saving measure might be to allow retired members who utilize TRICARE Primary Managers (already sanctioned to care for veterans), as the determining authority. Adding a VA vendor to this process is duplicative since TRICARE Primary Managers are already vetted to care for retirees.\nTheir is a memo CNN obtained from your office requiring the firing of 70,000 DVA employees. That’s 20% of the DVA workforce. You stated, “concerns that Veterans’ benefits might be targeted for cuts”, “I’m the Secretary of VA, and I’m telling you right now, that’s not happening… the reality is, Veterans benefits aren’t getting cut”, “In fact, we are actually giving and improving services.” The memo is published and factual. How is removing the workforce by 20% improve healthcare services, compensations and pensions, the PACT ACT, DVA medical housing, suicide prevention, and other disabled veteran services. It takes 9 months to get an appointment with a neurologist in Tucson DVA. Veterans have died waiting for DVA appointments. Senator McCain took actions to improve the Tucson DVA by adding the doctors you want to fire. YOU LIE and must have no care for veteran services, just veteran service reductions. Prove me wrong with facts, not lies. I had lots of respect for Republicans, but not for the person, proven a liar by a court jury, guilty of 34 incidents of fraud appointing you as Secretary of DVA. I have no respect for the Republicans siding with fear of this fraudster. You too sides with the Fraudster with praise due to fear to stand up to the fraudster.\nNine months is too long to wait in order to be seen by a VA neurologist. I also would like to better understand how removing 70,000 to 80, 000 VA employees will lead to better care for veterans.\nI stopped believing you at CNN.\nI personally visited the Fredericksburg 3 VA Clinic in Fredericksburg, Virginia on 3 March 2025. It is a beautiful facility that was not adequately staffed. I was told that the lab would only be open until 2 pm and that none of the specialty providers were available at that location due to funding. Secretary Collins, I implore you to have the honor and morals to do the right thing for your fellow veterans. We are hearing you tell us that VA services are not being affected as we watch it happen in real time. You have a moral imperative to do the right thing for the women and men who have honorably served this country. I expect more of you than this.\nMy husband has enjoyed VA benefits for many years and I am glad to read in this article that benefits are not going to be cut. I believe this info needs to be published on every news channel over and over. The American veterans need to know for sure that their benefits are not going to be cut in this attempt to make our country more accountable in the spending that is done.\nPlease tell the people . The left media seems to be spreading false information about Care for our veterans.\nhttps://newrepublic.com/post/192252/trump-lawyer-alina-habba-fired-veterans-arent-fit-job\nmy son was wounded in Iraq 2006,with TBI then MS. in a wheelchair, and went to Sneedville,Tenn. with a woman he married.

I was told died from MS> but I have alot of info. and statement from EMT. ,my son was left to starve to death. and I also found out more info. about other wounded . and us mothers call them “military maggots” who marry disabled vets for the funds. and I have dates ,times, and people who allowed my son to die this terrible way.

Dennis Keoki Cabanting served proudly ,only to die alone and neglected by so many\nAP article today 3/5/25 reports on an internal document outlining plans to fire 80,000 VA employees.\nAmerican veterans demand an explanation from Doug Collins.\nHow does this benefit veterans and their families?\nWhat services will be affected?\nHow will benefits be affected? How will they be “improved”?\nCan Doug Collins provide an explanation? Or is Doug Collins lying to veterans?\nhttps://www.wmtw.com/article/sen-angus-king-reacts-to-job-cuts-coming-to-veterans-affairs/64059551\nAs a 100% disabled vet (after a long 10 year battle) why does not the spouse get full benefits? They aren’t covered by the VA, they do not get Dental, they have to us ChampVA which alot of physicians do not take. Seems it would make alot of sense if they were covered just like the veteran is and could use the VA benefits he/she is entitled to. When you break it down, the spouse really doesn’t get benefits that are needed. Why is this:\nDefine faster. My 95 yr old mother is still waiting . Her case was filed for Aid and Attendance in Virginia in March 2024 and has been ” open ” since October 2024. It is now March 2025. Since she is over 85 , they were supposed to expidite it. I think they hope she will die first.\nGood day Secretary Collins, I got to say that something needs to be done to stop trump and maga. Tariffs! Really! The cost of living is already ridiculous. Folks working 2 or 3 jobs to make rent. I came from a Military family. My Dad, Brother and Myself. How can this person justify what he doing to us? Now he claims the flag is his. Bull Shit Sincerely. Alan Anderson\nI am pretty sure it has slowed down dramatically since Jan 20th. It was a 15 day turn around between steps, now its months before we see any movement.\nThe bva wing of the VA are full of unscrupulous lawyers and liers denying everything they can from veterans that need help the most. They don’t even try and hide their lies. It’s abysmal and this Collins fellow looks ominous and definitely insincere. He’s a lap dog for Trump. Good luck Vets\nHad hearing test at local VA add was told witch hearing aids I was getting and I told him I didn’t want that brand and he ordered them anyway. I told him again I didn’t want that brand and he said they are what I need and try them. Twice going back for adjustment and still ringing in my ears. Went back because the right one quit working. He said he would send it off for repair and once again I explained I didn’t want them. He said it’s been over six months and he couldn’t send them back. Once again I told him he should have done that on day one. He had no words. So now I have to go to Costco and get a new pair of what I want.\nI would like to see the VA look into the current practice of hosing the retired military on their disability payments. Any veteran who serves long enough to be eligible for disability gets the full amount tax free. if you are retiree, you get hosed out of the amount of your disability right out of your retirement payment. This inequjity applies to anyone with less than 50 pct disability. This is a capricious and wholly unfair practice referred to as the “VA waiver”. They take your money that you earned, with one hand and give it back to you as your oh so generous disability payment. The kicker is it is tax free. BFD. The standard deduction accounts for that if you are not filing long form. In the years since I retired in 1991 I have been stiffed out of several hundred thousand dollars by this asinine waiver. your reward for extra decades of service is to get hosed out of your actual disability by having it removed from your earned retirement. Bravo! If they overpay you for any reason on the disability side, they come after you as if it was not your own money in the first place. Honestly speaking, other than a slight tax advantage, there is NO disability for the military retiree should he fall under fifty percent. I would have more than my presenet 40 pct, but you can only fight them for so long before you just give up. Someone in power ought to look at the so called VA waiver and return fairness to those of us who served long and faithfully and are treated like second class citizens compared to those who did not stay til retirement and get the entire amount without any money coming out of their p;ockets.\nDear Mr. Secretary, At the VA here in Atlanta, they have a third party reviewing xrays. We used to be ale to view the reports and images on MyHealthEVet but now, we are unable to see either of those because of third party review. Those are our records and the y should be put into our records and allow us access to them so that we can see and understand what’s going on. If a third party is used, it must be made clear that the images and reports belong to the veteran and must be available for the veteran to have access to. Also, the VA uses some kind of strange mathematical formula to determine disability ratings. They like to brag about the fact that they aways err on the side of the veteran. That is an absolute lie. Can anything be done to change the formula that they use to determine ratings?\nDear Mr Secretary; I had a dental procedure done in Dec 2024,that I had to pay out of picket for. I mailed in the proper form 10-320 for reimbursement, with explanation and receipts. Today they are telling me I can appeal it. This isn’t how the President set community care. Go to any doctor pay for it and get reimbursed. Needs to be fixed! $1500. For a root canal.\nAre Vietnam vets claims given quicker consideration because of advanced age?\nAre Vietnam veterans claims addressed in a different manner than others? I.E. advanced age given more consideration?\nI am an 81 year old Vietnam veteran with 13 years military service (Infantry and Intelligence) and another 17 years working in DIA and the Old Soldiers Home.\nI know used car salesmen with better pitches than this. You should resign rather than allow several thousand VA employees to be summarily fired. It is hard for me to believe that you were a military chaplain. You are a disgrace to the uniform you wore and should be ashamed of yourself. Do the right thing and resign.\nToday March 2, 2025 White house Froze VA funding! I am deeply sad and just beyond words as to how horribly cruel it is of our own government to freeze funding for the VA.\nHas the President or his $ slashers stepped inside a VA hospital recently??? If they did they would witness many America Loving Veterans who have suffered severe atrocities of war or put their lives on the line for the benefit of all Americans to live safer lives. These same veterans are waiting and waiting and waiting for the serious medical care they need! They are all suffering in fear of dying in the hospitals because our government is showing a callous, uncaring temperament towards these hero’s!\nIt’s not just that many are in pain waiting for surgeries, it’s that the anxiety and panic amongst everyone, personnel included are at a high pitch! Who is helping? Who is helping? Who is helping these desperate, anxiety , pain ridden good folks! This is an American Abomination of an All Time High!!\nI was cut $500 it put me in a bad place I can”t pay all my bills!\nKathrine Clark, aka Kommie Katie, Congressional 5th District, Massachusetts lies about VA benefits. Please let her know the “gas lighting” has to stop. He lies are an abomination.\n“Hello Edwin,\nLate last week, Donald Trump and Elon Musk fired thousands of veterans and VA employees . That’s thousands of families suddenly without an income and millions of veterans carelessly put at risk.\nThis will mean longer waits for medical appointments, fewer VA home loans, more homeless veterans, longer claims, and worse PTSD support for vets in need. Of course, Trump isn’t just breaking our commitment to veterans for no reason. All of this chaos is an attempt to give a $2 trillion handout to billionaires .\nThat’s the Republican agenda in a nutshell: More for billionaires, less for vets.\nThis isn’t what people voted for. Republicans in Washington are openly betraying our veterans and we can’t let them get away with it.\nSincerely,\nAn image of Congresswoman Clark’s signature.\nCongresswoman Katherine Clark\nDemocratic Whip”\nMy comment for today, I would like to Thank each one of you 2,050 for there service that has posted on here.Being a Navy brat my father was in the service 30 years, my husband was military and I worked on the military base 33 years serving all active,retired,reserves. Reading all these comments it is hard to understand when I took my job to heart and gave it my all. It is a shame that all of you have to play a waiting game. Gold Star Wife\nInstead of American Taxpayers being forced to thank Veterans for their “service”, Veterans should be forced to thank American Taxpayers for their money. Veterans are a fat and self-entitled class of government-dependent parasites whose very existence is unAmerican.\nYou pos you veterans are parasites? WTF are you talking about asshole us veterans put our lives on the line so you can live your cushy life.\nIt’s obvious you never served your country, you are probably on welfare sucking the tits of American taxpayers. You sir should fu$k off.\nMr. Bender, I do hope that you will be able to allow your anger to eventually dissipate and know that Veterans are citizens who chose to volunteer to enter military service. As a five year old child, I was sitting on my father’s lap watching President Kennedy giving his speech after taking the oath of office. I was struck by his presentation and especially when he said “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what can you do for your country”. President Truman served in WW1 as an Army Captain of artillery, his unit was in combat throughout the war in France, President Kennedy was the Commanding Officer (in the Navy) of the PT-109, in WW2 which was engaged in seek and destroy missions in the South Pacific. President Lyndon Johnson was a Navy Lieutenant Commander who served in Australia and the South Pacific during WW2. My father volunteered for the Army in 1950 and served in the Korean War as a Medic in the 23rd Infantry Regiment. He was in the invasion force that landed at Inchon; he was wounded three times in separate battles and was awarded the Bronze Star with’V’ for Valor in late 1952. He was a quiet Veteran and was simply a citizen who went to War as it was his duty to serve. He and the millions of other citizens that have served were all honorable individuals and your ugly statement demeans their sacrifices.\nRepublicans haven’t told the truth since president Ford.\nSomeone is bitter…..Thank you for your taxpayer money. It will help provide the much-needed medical care after putting our lives on the line for ungrateful people like you. People like you assume you’re safe and secure because you are in the United States, the police, the FBI, etc. are a barricade and will protect us. Let me ask you this, who protects them? What are they going to do when a military-like Russia’s or China’s attack us? Do you think the police are going to be able to stop them?? Negative my ungrateful friend it takes young men and women like the ones in our military and our veterans to take the fight to our enemies thus returning to keep America safe. So next time, instead of running your mouth and being bitter towards what our country and its citizens have promised to provide us for our willingness to put our lives on the line, say thank you and move on!\nMy dad’s va check. Is short 1900 dollars they told him that the program that pays him for at home help care is being cut? I want answers and another thing got cut also they told hi m it was an executive order\nGood video, although I don’t necessarily believe what he says about the press and Doge, and current VA actions certainly aren’t a positive for we veterans. In addition, your actions as a Representative and current actions by Trump & Doge certainly make me, and others question whether we can believe you. But for now, I certainly hope you’re right. If not, you’ll get this video sent right back with a remark that his word isn’t worth the space it occupies.\nDirector Collings is a joke; he doesn’t have a clue. The most recent round of cuts has impacted my VA healthcare in two ways. First, I was to have a laser ablation procedure in my throat in April. When I called the VA yesterday, I was told that the contract for the laser machine had been cancelled due to the Trump/Musk/ Collins initiative. (Several of the hospitals in the area have a lease agreement to share the machine to reduce the cost. Now the hospital is waiting to find out when and if the contract can be renegotiated.\nSecond, I have two VA compensation claims on hold evidently because the DOGE administration let go the workers who are assisting with the claims process.\nNow the administration has rescinded their idiotic decisions, but the damage is done.\nMy procedure is delayed, and my claims are further delayed.\nWhat the administration is doing is fraudulent and a disservice to our veterans.\nDenying and/or reducing benefits for which Vets have qualified- especially when they have been receiving those benefits and relying on them- is cruel and un-American. Equally cruel and unwise is curtailing of survivor benefits. Who will want to serve this country when all incentives to do so are removed entirely? Also, once the disability is designated, along with the qualifying percentage, and the Vet is receiving compensation from the VA, it is unconscionable to reduce or curtail compensation on which that Vet relies. I am aware that some Vet benefits appear to be windfalls. However when time served earning what is essentially a minimum wage is considered, this seeming “windfall” looks more like appreciation for service. In addition, I have to note that disparaging and smug comments, (made by Vets who are not experiencing problems with benefits), are inappropriate and not in accordance with the spirit of service. Sanguine comments that mock and dismiss the harm caused by indiscriminate denial of benefits to fellow Vets says a lot about the integrity of the commenter. I would not choose to be in a situation wherein I would have to, as a service member, rely on such an individual to honor their oath and commitment.\nYour extreme right views and support for all Trump’s wants and desires and your stint with Georgia’s 9th Congressional District, one of the most Republican districts in the country, belie your claim that no cuts will be made to the VA system. And your support of DOGE, claiming that they are doing exactly what is necessary is laughable. Rolling Stone reports: “Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins’ tenure is off to a rocky start. The former Georgia congressman and unapologetic Donald Trump loyalist began by releasing a series of videos assuring that “despite the rhetoric, there would be no cuts at VA.” These videos preceded two rounds of layoffs at the department — first, 1,000 employees, many of them veterans, and then another 1,400 last week. Notably, Collins was not being forced to make these cuts by Trump or the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Instead, he appears to be slashing VA jobs simply to win favor with Trump and Elon Musk.”\nYou may not like Rolling Stone, but even the AP has reported: “VA pauses billions in cuts lauded by Musk as lawmakers and veterans decry loss of critical care. The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in contract cuts after an uproar that critical veterans health services were harmed, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday. ”\nI could quote many more news outlets, but you would simply falsely state they are all false claims. I give up.\n“Extreme right views” is all these veterans need to hear. You are a fake news consumer, aka Pravda Propaganda. Do some basic research. Your cognitive dissonance won’t let the facts in. Yes, the VA is notorious for their delay, deny and die ideology with it comes to veteran benefits. I’ve been fighting the VA for ten years. The battle continues. I will beat them at their own game.\nThe Democrat Communist Party Pravda Propaganda machine feeds us nothing except FEAR PORN. Fear is an emotional reaction. Using Critical thinking skills, logic and commonsense is the cure. Fight, Fight, Fight and win.\nMy heart goes out to Vets like Malcolm (who wrote on Malcolm February 28, 2025 at 09:01), and :\n“VA Secretary Doug Collins, I was exposed to Agent Orange while I was stationed at (Udon) Thailand in 1974, I have developed Leukemia due to my exposure…The VA just reduced my compensation on chronic lymphoma leukemia from 100% to 0%….My anxiety went through the roof”.\nI am a registered nurse formerly employed by the VA. Meddling with the disability qualification requirements and percentages is CRUEL, SENSELESS, UNWISE, and just WRONG. If they are eliminated or reduced (and they should not be), then the Vets or their survivors whom are already qualified should not be denied the disability benefits earned and that they have been receiving. It is not wise to eliminate any of the few incentives for Americans to enter the military, as it is. They give life and limb. How can this be happening in the United States of America?\nThank you, Barbie Roelofs, for speaking out. At 74 that was devastating news. I’m sure all of these comments fall on deaf ears…\nWhat about Health programs?\nNot to be trusted. Trump will push him to eat his words. Especially since VA personnel are being disrespected and “fired” by the thousands.\nThank you Mr. Collins. May God Bless you in your job as new VA Secretary.\nWOW, what a used car salesman presentation\nKeep it up va I go to Hampton va for my\nTreatment and meds thanks\nFor the service sir no complaints and wife gets her champ va everything is great for her\nSir, I think you need to rescind your assurances that veterans benefits would not be cut.\nthe CBO is beating the drum again this year for reduction or elimination of va disability pay.\nThey do this annually and cause much angst among veterans.\nIt appears to me that if their scheme is enacted, it drive thousands of widows into poverty\nbecause of the loss of Total disability by their husband and concomitantly DIC.\nVeterans who have been receiving IU 100% for years have been unable to establish IRAs’\nand other retirement instruments. They are unable to work. They also are uninsurable\nfor life insurance because of their disabilities.\nI voted for Donald Trump, I can say factually that the veterans community are re-thinking\ntheir decision. I am 100% p/t from Vietnam. There is a tidal wave coming, these ill advised\nproposals will pave the way for the Democrats to retake the house and senate.\nI can state unequivocably that if these idiotic actions become reality I will be changing parties.\nIs this really what these bureaucrats want for disabled veterans\nLOL. Trump worked hard for over eight years to tell the world that he would dismantle everything great about America. Real Americans warned you a thousand times. You failed America with your votes for Trump. Own it.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins, I was exposed to Agent Orange while I was stationed at Udorn Thailand in 1974, I have developed Leukemia due to my exposure…The VA just reduced my compensation on chronic lymphoma leukemia from 100% to 0%….My anxiety went through the roof\nImagine your 1SG letting another 1SG come into your company and discharging Soldiers at will. Collins let Musk do that. Proof that Collins won’t even protect his own workforce for the benefit of veterans.\nImagine your 1SG sucking up to the CSM like Collins sucks up to Trump.\nSecretary Collins … I would like to apologize, sir, for the need to say what I am about to say. Simply stated, I do not believe a word you said. On the one hand, with only a month on the job, you have not had a lot of time to prove your loyalties. On the other hand, we all know your reputation and, to be frank, do not believe for one minute that your priorities and loyalties are to the Veterans who defended our country and whose sacrifices have made your job possible in the first place. On behalf of millions of American Veterans, living and dead, I challenge you to prove to us, in the same way that we have proven our loyalty to our country, that you intend to be loyal to us. That’s it in a nutshell. Forgive me again, sir, but now the ball is in your court. History will record for all time where your loyalties lie.\nI second what John Washbush said here 100 percent. History and The Lord both will record your actions!\nMr Secretary Collins, I would like to extend my sincere THANK YOU to Ms. Grace Brumley, from the International Direct Deposit Team, VA Regional Office 351 – Muskogee, OK, for solving the 14 month long delay in my payments by getting Electronic Transfer rather than paying by checks being issued by the Foreign Medical Program (FMP) Office https://www.va.gov/health-care/foreign-medical-program/\nMs. Grace Brumley exemplified your challenge to ” focus relentlessly on customer service and convenience” and I hope that your office will recognize her efforts to “solve REAL PROBLEMS” being faced by Veterans in receiving payments or other services we have earned.\nThank you!!!\nDr. PDG, Jakarta, Indonesia\nStop doing videos and stand up to Trump and tell us what you’re doing instead of on a video. I do not trust this.\nWhy aren’t you doing press conferences instead of videos? These one-way videos make it seem like the director is afraid soemone will ask questions and demand real data.\nWhy are they firing most researchers ones that are in the middle of studies that was already paid fo outside the VA makes no sense and all was to try and help the veterans i thought that was your job to help the veterans i was in the hospital on the 24 th. And everyone was scared about having a job if you think that helps the veterans your wrong and i voted for trump.\nWelcome to the Find Out stage of FAFO.\nWhy is the VA not properly paying its Community Care Providers, specifically Therapeutic Massage. We took a 24% rate cut in October of 2023 in the middle of the worst inflation we have ever seen. This caused many providers to cancel their contracts and others to reduce the number of veterans served. This action is directly responsible for the suffering of our Veterans. Please fix this problem!\nVA Secretary Collin’s ….DOGE= Dog “Shit”…They are cutting essential Personnel, How are us as Veterans suppose to get the care we need when the VA Facilities & Community Care are empty…..These are some of the most dangerous & corrupt cuts that ever could happen…..Rag-Bag Elon Musk(not even From our United States)..?? You need to explain yourself Sir, when you say you agree what (So called DOGE) is doing or are you committed to standing up for myself & my Brothers & Sisters (Veterans)…these cut @ VETERAN AFFAIRS… Secretary Collin’s has done nothing to speed up anything (except THE AGENDA) Veterans want “REAL ANSWERS” not the Politically Correct answers…..Our Veterans Employees deserve better than this Crazy Shit that is happening to them & thier Families….Lead,Follow or get out of the way!!!\nListening the emotional outbursts of liberals are annoying and bothersome. Grow up do some research.\nWhy are the VA facilities empty?\n“Collins said he would seek to bring more employees into the office rather than allowing them to telework, though he noted he was bound by collective bargaining agreements that represent 80% of the VA workforce. He similarly pledged to follow labor contracts and all other legal processes when seeking to fire more department staff, though he said he would ultimately not be restricted in getting rid of malfeasant workers. “\nThe VA demeans veterans when it does not permit admission into the VA medical system because of an income above some low level.\nI hope Doug can help with the LOGIN.GOV over reach of Veterans personal information. I’m absolutely disgusted with the VA as it pertains to that, specifically!\nThe VA is indeed clearing cases faster than before, but only because they are declining more than ever. Veterans hospitals are not improving, they are getting worse, The VA hospital I attend is very short handed on doctors and I learned yesterday that 2 more of our really good doctors are leaving the VA. Loosing Doctors and the hiring freeze is causing a 2 to 4 month wait to get an appointment. I applied for counselling at my VA due to depression and am having to wait almost 2 months to see a councilor. I have been fighting for my VA disability since 2010 and am still being denied. I can truly understand why Veterans commit suicide.\nNot worried about privacy info being exposed. After all, Equifax was hacked to the tune of 143 million citizens, so it figures that all of my info is already floating around the dark web somewhere!\nYour living in a friggin dream world!!! The VA in both NJ and wills Barre have done everything and did DESTROY\nMy ability to pass any background check by leaking out flat out toxic gaslighting lies all were from a fake woman rep 1 when I used to live in Jersey and now in wills Barre pa both were not related to each other but the pa VA hates vets so much when I applied for my PTSD and my broken bones from army they will call either 2 things “Nutzo or slutz”!! They deliberately infected me with a toxin from a surgical instrument in wills Barre pa and made me so ill I couldn’t even walk! The top brass gives orders to make sure you don’t get your benefits and if they find out you got them before admin finds out they litterly make sure you never go there again, so I tried waiting 2 years and went to one in upstate NY not only did they tried to lie to me, they wanted a surgery to go to the Bronx NYC for the dental surgery that would “take months” to recover when I said you know how can I have surgery when there is no teeth to pull? I knew the last wills Barre didn’t pay the community care dentist and I had to call a congressman to get the va to pay the dentist that and I’m guessing did not sit well with the top brass in Willsk Barre so a vendetta was made without my knowledge, so it’s a good guess that they want to give you the same dental treatment that John Gotti got in prison. The gov gave him cancer in a dental filling, and that’s what I’m guessing they have tried to do to me, this was a warning for me never to go back to Any Va!!! Willsk Barre is run like the Mafia.!!!!\nRep Collins , I not writing this to complain about the service of care providers in our community but, lol I have one small issue that we don’t have a VA hospital in Anchorage or Fairbanks,Alaska. I am lucky enough to be able to go to Chief Andrew clinic in Fairbanks and just to let you know I have received the best care I have ever received from VA. My issue is if I go to the VA clinic it’s over a damn computer and a nurse doing everything a Dr is supposed to do to help me. I don’t know how you feel about having to sit and talk to a doctor over a computer. When just down the street I get to see a doctor in person and God as my witness I can say that I have never been seen and treated like I’m a King ever time. We’re wasting our money on a clinic that works over a computer and I don’t see why we should pay for that kind of treatment. I would like to see that my fellow Veterans get the same treatment that I do thank you for listening to me. Per capital we have more veterans than any other state. Thanks Ron\nMr Collins , you are saying one thing , but in reality you do the opposite. I do not trust you, along with other veterans. You are allowing VA employees to be fired, possible changes in healthcare and disability. Whenever there are budget cuts, veterans are the first on the chopping block. Veterans do not want a yes man for the current administration. We want someone that will fight for us. We have earned every damn VA benefit. The current administration could care less about us. Trump is allowing an unqualified and unelected man to make decisions about the VA programs. Musk is the hit man for Trump and they are destroying everything that we know. You are either for veterans or you are not. Find your spine, voice and protect veterans. We have served our country through wars and conflicts. It is your responsibility to fight for us. Freedom is not free.\nGreat to that we got a Secretary that cares about Veterans. Let’s see if he’ll get us more than an annual 1-2% COLA increase. Congress goes and proposes a 40% pay increase for themselves and only about 10% served in the armed forces defending our country and the citizens of it.\nSome of us are deemed unemployable and struggle paycheck to paycheck. Like myself.\nI honestly don’t believe, or trust you.\nAs a Trump loyalist, your true allegiance is not to us, the veterans, but rather to the President.\nFrom your previous term, you should be well versed on the “Concurrent Pay” issue.\nWhy hasn’t this been taken care of. Even (then) Sen. Harry Reid made it his FIRST bill submission. It always gets buried.\nI was ripped off for half my 30 years of disabled retirement. When I received $400 for disabiliy, my meager enlisted retirement check was struck with a $400 deduction.\nPresident Lincoln established Concurrent Pay to help the enlisted soldier. It also was meant to put the responsibility of disabled Officers (then Aristocrats) on themselves. This is no longer close to fair today (although I have no idea why an officer gets 2-5 times more than this combat/retired/disabled Green Beret).\nShow us what you are made of. You should be our Governor or Senator. I hope you are the man I think you are.\nLead the charge, Sir!!! I have no dog in this fight as I’m now 100% (after a 29 year fight). But, our Brothers in Arms don’t deserve this.\nAnd, if President Trump wants to give away money, skip the people who won’t work and slide it over to us who have been screwed and fighting with our finger nails to get a fair shake. Otherwise, take care of the brothers behind me.\nGod Bless\nDe Oppresso Liber\nHe is correct. Many INSANE people who listen to FOREIGN CORPORATION MEDIA (Nearly every media source in USA) – most directly owned and paid by the WEF and it’s insane globalists.\nDOGE will make efficient, streamlined action. Good GOD, people: NONE OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EVER SAY ANYTHING TRUE. DO A SIMPLE SEARCH ON the company which owns your news station, which owns that, which owns that – you will find they are foreign companies.\nI am dating a 78 year-old veteran and I am 72 and all we do is argue because I’m a Trump supporter and he is not any throws in my face that this morning the president said he was going to cut the veterans benefits. What can I say back to him to quit listening to the fault narratives that are on the news but he said that Trump said it so can you clarify it for me?\nTell him that his statement is, as labeled by the great Gen. Swartzkoff…. “bovine scatology!” LOL! Just a thought! :D\nI’m a veteran and this administration has declared war on us… WHY?\nDo I believe that Collins has any control over the matter???…Hell No! Anyone who sits across the table from this president or Elon Musk will toe the line of the administration’s conjured up policies, regardless of whose lives they destroy. Wise up, and don’t be a party to this foolishness, Mister Collins.\nMy experience with the VA is that of honest people attempting to do their best with little time, resources, and management support. I pity them, but wholeheartedly thank and respect their dedication to. the cause.\nYou obviously don’t know Mr. Collins. He doesn’t cower to anybody. He shut down the Trump Impeachment with his legal prowess.\nYour experience with the VA is similar to mine, except I find several persons hanging around with seemingly nothing to do.\nI pray that God Almighty creates a special place in hell for anyone that wants to privatize the VA.\nDO you support the Heritage Foundation and Project 2025’s framework for restructuring, reducing and taking benefits and disability ratings from the veteran community ? Please answer this question.\nEnough of the Fake News lies: Project 25 is from a private organization. It has nothing to do with President Trump. Do some basic research.\nWill health care professionals be let go? The VA has made vast improvements in last 10 years or so. I was dealing with the medical issues. The whole operation seemed to be chaotic. Nobody would return phone calls. Sometimes there would be a neurologist on staff. Other times the nearest neurologist was in Buffalo. You never knew what to expect. I really dreaded dealing with the VA. I’d have to drive to the VA to get information or prescriptions or to get a simple question answered. Those days are over. Please don’t let them come back. You’ve made such great improvements. The VA has a new facility here (ROPC). I’ve had the same medical team for eight or so years now. The staff is friendly and concerned about my health. My meds arrive on time. And other vets I’ve talked with feel the same way. I can’t adequately express how much the VA has improved. The care I receive at the VA is better than civilian care (they seem to be going down hill). Please don’t let the VA slip back into chaos\nI was notified by my local VA that community care service is being eliminated. I had to cancel my next appointment. They said I could either go to the community care but then could not go to the VA. That doesn’t make sense. Now I have to drive an hour and a half to my closest VA instead of 2 blocks to local hospital. Also some of my appointments\nare further apart due to staff reductions??\nAlso since Trump started all of the funding cuts my medication deliveries have been stopping and I am constantly calling to straighten. Out the mess. Things just seem to not be working smoothly anymore.\nIn no way do I trust the current CIC, any of his appointees, and certainly not the “DOGE”. Looking for inefficiencies in all Federal government agencies is certainly a necessary endeavor, napalming those agencies is unacceptable and un-American.\nThey cut my benefits\nWhat? Are you kidding?\nWhat benefits were cut?\nExplain your situation, my benefits have not been touched. I don’t know where everyone is lying about their benefits being touched. Can you please give more details\nI got my disability cut from what they say is from 100% to 90% from apllying for the pact act and got cut from over $3800 to $2297 starting March 2025 and talking about going down to just over $2200 and wished I never put in for the fraud Pact Act to give others our money and I’m going to be homeless and starved to death and Unemployable that’s the thanks for our service is all we get and they hope we die before we get to 100% and decrease it. Just like the cadence says “they give you a hundred dollars and take back 99. I’m telling my grandchildren stay out of the military from grandad’s expeirience until they get the benefits right without the paper chase beuracracy\nYou didn’t know the Pact Act was a setup to do exactly what they did to you? If you were already 100% WHY did you file another claim??????\nYeah, you are a complete idiot for touching your claims after already having 100%\nThis is a sad day when people are on here rooting for this idiot from Georgia who is part of the problem. The Trump administration just fired the company that cleans the surgical tools in the operating room before they operate on a veteran they also just let go of the company who checks the radiation on the MRI and X-ray machines to make sure the veterans don’t get too much radiation. But some of you are on here praising this man they’re trying to sell the headquarters of the VA lol but they can actually sell the Federal building but they tried. And I see a couple people in their talking about give the man a chance you guys are pathetic. Cutting $80,000 jobs when the VA was already struggling and then you have somebody that is actually showing you they want to take veterans out anybody that voted for this crap is getting what they deserve.\nWhy is a company called Veterans Evaluation Services being used ? It has been my experiences with them to be a waste of time and “our” money ! All they have ever done is look at my VA records and confirm that my records are valid ! I’m sure that my 12 year old Grandson could do the same thing if I gave him access to my files ! And welcome aboard Secretary Collins !\nI really hope that I don’t get cheated as I been for 13 years, with concussion that has caused me demihelanation of brain,chronic high\nblood pressure, sleep apnea, seizures when anxiety is elevated and many others secondary disabilities.i have been unemployable since 2009 and not rated.\nI applied for an increase in my disability rating on 6/10/24. Since then I have received requests for employment info that I have responded to. However it seems I am in a loop without end. I respond and then receive another request, then I respond again. I feel that this is a delay tactic to avoid making a decision. It is frustrating to say the least. I hope with the leadership change with the VA that this can be resolved. I have always been grateful for the care I received through the VA, and by and large have been very pleased with the level of care its provided.\nCongratulations Secertary Collins on your new appointment. My husband was a veteran. He was shot in the head in Vietnam. He was in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. The VA took care of him for 55 years. Several years ago, a CT scan was done, and we found that injury took 50% of his brain. The VA paid for his rehab, education and ALL of his care. They even helped me through many difficult times. They hired him as an Educational Therapist and later as Prosthetic & Sensory Aid Services Representative. He was employed for many years and retired in 2000. We both felt that if he had been taken care of in the private sector he would not have survived near as long. The multidisciplinary team approach plus the knowledge related to veterans’ long problem lists allowed him to survive the 55 years. I realize there is waste in the VA and the waste needs eliminated. However, do not let anyone eliminate the system. It was certainly a blessing for him and me. Thank you.\nWhere is the waste? Elon Musk will gut everything and ask forgiveness later. You cannot encourage the reckless behavior of billionaires who have never known hardships. They don’t care what they cut as long as the number is big.\nYou are correct. Many INSANE people who listen to FOREIGN CORPORATION MEDIA (Nearly every media source in USA) – most directly owned and paid by the WEF and it’s insane globalists.\nDOGE will make efficient, streamlined action. Good GOD, people: NONE OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EVER SAY ANYTHING TRUE. DO A SIMPLE SEARCH ON the company which owns your news station, which owns that, which owns that – you will find they are foreign companies.\nActually I think you are a communist spy, trolling this site and spreading propaganda and lies, like a good little comrade. Please go take your cut and paste post and shove it.\nBottom line, a Vietnam draft dodger and a corporate welfare foreign national (the latter unelected) running and destroying our government and thus our country that we here lived and in some cases died for.\nSir, please don’t cave in to the spoiled Brat Billionaires who never served and don’t give one shit about us veterans. Anyone that calls POWs loosers can rot in hell – yes I’m talking about Captain Bonespurs Trump, he said that, check tape.\nI can only pray that current VA leaders have the spine and backbone that politicians left at the door.\nI am a 1980s Cold Warrior till I die, and you poster are in fact a commie if you support a Putin, Xi, Kim loving president.\nAnd I call BS on your post. It simply isn’t true, and you are probably a Russian spawed bot anyhow.\n(yea, Musk isn’t even a real American, he’s from South Africa and only naturalized in 2002, holds citizenship in 3 different countries, so yea, where does his allegiance lay?)\nThank you for the information, transparency and congratulations on your appointment. I’m a veteran, but also a proud spouse of a VA employee (also veteran). I’m hopeful that in the coming days you and your leadership team will be providing transparency to VA employees and staff so we can anticipate any future changes. I know the situation is changing daily and quite fluid and I’m sure we aren’t the only family looking forward to this information. We appreciate what you are trying to do. Best wishes.\nfellow veterans please lets try to mind our words and stand by if we have nothing positive to contribute on this message forum- lets try to work together as i write this their are 1,955 comments on here and some are well intentioned, some are revealing our divide amongst our sides. I am on neither side I am with all of you as fellow Americans and veterans. This situation we are living through can be overcome but we must work together, remember our discipline and memories of how we work together as a team even in the most dire of situations. We must hope and expect the best from our current chain of command as our success or failure is coalescent on their decisions and actions. Health, fortitude, peace and humor as we navigate these next few years but above all optimism that things will work out.\nRespectfully,\naguilar santos\nHey Santos, you going to be so polite when your orange Jesus deports you?\nCongratulations Secertary Collins on your new job. I see all these comments and veterans are confused and need their questions answered. I see Kirt Love postings and he has many unanswered questions that need your support. Why doesn’t someone from your office get back to Kirt Love for some real questions to get answered. Please follow up. Ed Bryan\nCongratulations Mr. Collins on your appointment and your transparency. I receive excellent care all throughout the VA – way better than civilian care. Now, to all the negativity a select few continue to post – We are all proud that President Trump is back (I repeat, BACK!) in the White House.\nNo, we are not all proud that white supremacists who want to end the Constitution are back in the oval. You sure don’t speak for me nor millions of other patriots who want to PRESERVE the Constitution.\nI’m dealing with a really bad case of bone spurs. LOL\nGuess what over 50% of the people working at the VA are not Veterans, they don’t even know what a Veteran has done for this country, their families. You work somewhere, your boss ask or the book keeper as what you did that week before you get paid. Hey you can tell them and will tell them to keep your job. Realize that a lot of people took advantage of the virus, stopped going in to work, but continued to get paid by the taxes you and I pay to the government, then got another job or moved to an foreign beach and send in work by computer if at all. Notice how you can’t get anyone to answer the Phone. Wake up, they need to go and only those who care and want to work should be kept.\nI wrote to you last week, I have been a claims agent accredited for years 20 or so. The problem is here in Arizona Doctors are needed in community care. However, a chiropractor in Camp Verde put his application in again to help and was turned down and not answered as to why, he has to be creditionaled only by one company and that company want you to pay them and you have to take all of the insurances they have or you can’t be part Of them. Kick back in sure. For all of central and no. As there is one chiropractor. This is wrong and should be checked. Verde Valley Family Chiropractor Kyle French was at one time signed with VA, but stopped working for a while family diffaculties. Now they won’t let him help. Hope you can find out the problem. All doctors and nurses are needed in this area and across the country.\nI watched the video several times and all I heard was “the media is telling you things I don’t like. Well, nuh-uh!” but in a folksy voice.\nAgreed. What a waste of hot air.\nThe Veterans Health Administration is America’s largest integrated health care system, providing care at 1,380 health care facilities, including 170 medical centers and 1,193 outpatient sites of care of varying complexity (VHA outpatient clinics), serving 9.1 million enrolled Veterans each year.\nI suspect that many of the negative, fear-mongering comments here are people with memory deficits. As a caregiver of a 100% disabled Veteran since Vietnam era, I have seen the VA rise and fall with each administration. I distinctly remember the previous short 4-years under the first Trump administration as being a breath of fresh air after the Obama administration’s middle finger to Veterans. By the end of his first term, President Trump had managed to clear the backlog, get enough doctors and medical specialists hired and streamlined the process of getting care. https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-putting-veterans-first/ Within just a few months of Biden in charge, it went right back to the boondoggle of the pre-Trump years.\nThe VA is a HUGE beaurocracy with multiple layers of services for every type of veteran from WWII to present. If you expect the system to change in 30-days, you’re only kidding yourself. You can yell or you can do something. Every county is represented by a Veteran’s Service Officer. Every county is represented by both State and US Congressmen and Congresswomen. Most, but not all, VA employees serve veterans and will do everything possible to assist you with information, processes and procedures, communications and expectations. If you’re not a jerk, one or all of these avenues are open to you. Even if you are a jerk, most will still try to help deserving veterans and their families.\nDoug Collins and Donald Trump have been elected to try to straighten out the mess once again. Work with them instead of against them and you will see a dramatic improvement once the waste, fraud, abuse and red tape of previous administrations are cleared out of the way. They truly do need to “clean house” at VA to make room for dedicated people with the will, training and dedication to help with this mission. There are a lot of them but we need 100% mission-driven patriots from the front door to the top floor and no slackers need apply.\nIn what bizarre world is A Vietnam War draft dodger who badmouths POWs, Veterans, even service members killed in a helicopter accident, a patriot???\nOh, and his buddy Musk isn’t even a real American. He’s an immigrant from South Africa naturalized in 2002, look it up. So yea, also not a patriot.\nThey are both self-serving billionaires with billionaire cronies, who don’t give two shits about Vets. That means you Reader, regardless of which party you vote for. These guys are gonna screw you in a heartbeat.\nHow can you tell a republican is lying? His lips are moving.\nCollins may believe he’s telling the truth but as soon as Con Man Trump determines the time is right, he’ll screw all veterans. You should expect nothing less from the draft dodger. And when he does change his mind, Doug Collins will be right there kissing the ring and do nothing to support veterans. It’s almost like I can see the future – right Doug.\nAs a veteran enjoying the benefits I earned after serving for over 32 years I can personally attest to how great The Community Care program is for when I need care that’s not offered at my local clinic. This program was introduced during President Trump’s first term. I can also remember how bad the VA was during former President Obama’s administration whenever I attempted to get care. Thankfully I had healthcare insurance through my civilian job. May I ask if you’re a veteran? If so, what has been your experience?\nYou may want to research that further. It’s so tiresome that people are always looking in the rearview mirror to vilify past leadership in an effort to elevate the current traitor, even if it is a lie. Pres. Obama signed it into law!\nThe “program started in 2014 following a scandal over wait times at Veterans Affairs facilities. The program was created through the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, a bipartisan bill that was signed by President Barack Obama.”\nFact Check: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-veterans-free-health-care/\nFact Check: https://www.factcheck.org/2018/03/trump-veterans-choice-program/\nGlad to hear you are having a good experience and it is working well for your healthcare needs; however, it is not the same for everyone, everywhere.\nWhere I currently live it is not efficient. Females are farmed out to the community for basic healthcare, and the claims are routinely denied for stupid reasons, regardless of an authorization. Community care is limited to a monopoly healthcare system, and Veterans are not always treated with kindness or respect. The whole community care program is also untimely.\nFor example, getting a mammo or other female care should not require multiple intermediaries to get an auth and schedule the care. Furthermore, if a mammo is abnormal, and follow-up is required with further films or an ultrasound, etc. It’s back to waiting for the process, again.\nThat said, if I receive an unfortunate diagnosis and need to navigate community care program for cancer care, etc., it would be a nightmare. In my line of work, I saw what Veterans had to deal relative to unpaid community care claims, etc. The process could definitely be streamlined.\nNOTE: Any misogynists or sexists who feel the need to make negative comments about female Veterans can keep them. I’ve already heard it, seen it, and experienced it for years.\nThank you for setting it straight. I get so tired of hearing what Trump has done when it iks just an extension of Obamas work and I have been in VA care the whole time so I have experienced it personally\nI know of a lady who works for the Social Security. She told my wife that on the horizon are works in place so that we have to choose between SSN and our Veterans benefits. Maybe this is a rumor started in house to provoke us to behave badly. I trust my government, and that this is just a silly rumor perpetrated by opponents of our duly elected president.\nDoge is not a government entity. I insist that you stop working with a bunch of criminals.\nThey are not vetted or have security clearances. They are a bunch of egomaniac punks.\nDodge serves as the pleasure of the President. Legal\nAt the pleasure of a convicted felon, lifelong grifter, and someone convicted of sexual assault. Why would I trust him?\nThe predator in chief serves at the pleasure of an incompetent nepo baby. Clear the GOP lies from your ears and look at what’s in front of you. Donald Trump doesn’t care about you and never will. Elon Musk comes from a family of billionaire emerald mine owners who were literally proud members of the nazi party.\nI cannot believe how easily so many of you gave our country to a bunch of billionaire oligarchs who are cozying up to mass murdering dictators. Victor Orban, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un were the only people voting against the UN resolution condemning Putins illegal invasion of Ukraine, and your idiot president joined them.\nCongrats Mr. Secretary\nWould you please consider the letter on Panama Veterans submitted by 34 members of congress to identify Panama Veterans under the Pact Act/\nHe is lying.\nSenators (all Rep except Hawley from\nMO) rejected an amendment to the budget outline proposed on February 20.\nThe amendment brought by a Democratic senator I believe From Connecticut requested the VA healthcare funding be at the same level. It is now to not reduce those levels in the new budget. It was rejected by all, except that one Republican senator. All the Democrat senators and the independence voted for the amendment. They want funding for veterans healthcare to at least stay where it is now and to not be cut.\nA lot of people claim to be for the military and for veterans but when it comes down to it, they are not. They are for lining their own pockets. Rolling Stone has a great article about how doge has not found fraud in the VA all they’ve done to save money as fired, doctors nurses office workers and things like that.\nGoing to pitch a idea for everyone coming here. Instead of you posting once\nand walking away, look for others you share similarities and unite.\nVA does not want any of you to rally. They want you to remain individuals\non here and bicker. That way they can claim there is no common interest\nand nothing to answer.\nBest possible place to try: Change.org and set up a petition of things you all\nwould support. Single idea, easy to agree on. Dont write a book, Get the\nfirst or second idea running with a few thousand on board. Then VA cant\nignore you. Like “Open door policy at VA”.\nRight now, they just want to see who the loudest people are to ignore. This\nis a test bed on who to turn away or frustrate. Even the service groups. These\nfolks want to rule by keeping you all “Armies of one” No matter how good the\nidea, VA only responds to numerical support – angry mob.\nBeen doing this 28 years, watched what hasnt worked. Been pitching this to\nadvisory committee to bypass there own deadlocks. You only have to be a team\nfor that one idea folks. Regardless of personality.\nOther wise, sec of VA Doug Collins is going to ignore every one of you. He is\nalready doing that with me. All talk, same old song and dance as the others.\nIts easier than you think folks. Commit to a idea, and unite on it.\nI just got my second denial letter for VA referred community care since there are no in-house women’s programs where I live. As a 100% disabled vet, I’m once again a subpar citizen simply because I don’t have male genitalia. I get to bleed to death from a military related injury. Thanks guys!\nHi, thanks for commenting. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance.\nI agree!!! Same here! I don’t even bother to get female care anymore because it is an effing nightmare! Every time I was sent to the community, it was denied and not paid, regardless of a prior auth. Optum is notorious for denying payment even after they give an auth. I finally escalated it, with all the receipts, and nothing.\nHow many current and planned positions have already been lost since January 20th?\nHow many families have uprooted to move for a promised position only to have it canceled since January 20th?\nCan you explain why a pharmacist can change the dosage of medication prescribed by a heart specialist?\nSeems a bit strange.\nCongratulations on your new job. I am happy to know that you were selected for this job. I know that you will do great for us veterans.\nFor years democrats have controlled the VA. Now that President Trump and his team are in charge, democrat vets are singing the same disrespectful songs of the fake news radicals. (See comments) Secretary Collins has been in office for less that two weeks and they are already saying he is a failure. For God’s sakes men, give him a chance. The entire administration has only had a month to improve things, and the improvements in every area are significant. God bless you, President Trump, and your entire team. AMERICA FIRST!!!\nBernie Sanders and President Biden have done fine jobs on helping veterans but you want to believe a draft dodging LOSER and his lies over actual proof of those first 2 men obviously supporting veterans. I mean you do remember that President Biden had a son in the military he lost? All of DJT family dodged serving their countries, even his granddaddy first immigrated here to dodge his country, Austria’s draft to come here. You do know that means every time he dodged his draft other men were selected to go in his place? You’re worship of one of the most greedy money hungry loving conman actually makes me sick. You’re the type to have joined a hunting party to go after escaped slaves before and during the Civil War, just reading your comment tells me a lot about the type of person you really are. Probably joined the military to get to kill more than animals too, well I joined to help defend my country and to get more education and to travel the world and learn about different cultures etc\nShut down the VA go to medicare. I’ve been waiting for a consult for 3 months and no one can say why. They have lost some of my records when they can find any. Doing away with the VA is not cutting benefits. I can almost write a book of the disrespect and l ack of care I’ve received from the VA. https://news.va.gov/138326/va-secretary-doug-collins-veterans-benefits/\nAMEN!!! EXCELLENT reply, Ron!!\nI only hold them to the promises they made. No one forced them to claim they would lower groceries on Day 1, they said that . I say hold them to it or they lied for your vote and you still back them? Sad\nYou people are the biggest bunch of crybaby whiners I’ve ever seen. Not a positive comment in the bunch of you about what good the VA does; just complaints and “give me more”. Try a little gratitude for what good comes your way from the VA instead of all this entitled bull**\nEntitled? Are you even a veteran or just commenting to be a good little DT bootlicker? You do realize that some of these people have been waiting for decades to be able to get benefits like healthcare that they need in order to be alive? I know this one guy that said he’d fought for 20 years because he had to dump toxic waste for the military, but he lied about his age to join and they did something with his service record and he’s got witnesses etc but they’ll literally wait them out to death so they don’t have to pay out\nRoger That, Doug!!! It’s really difficult to believe that most of these brainwashed, Crybaby Whiners could have ever served our Republic with service in our Armed Forces!!!\nGood soldiers are not afraid to ask questions. Some of the people that you are censoring may have a question that you did not think of to answer. Stop badmouthing these heroes who are exercising the right that they fought for.\nThis sounds like the same attitude that our Vietnam Veterans received after the war when years later we found that their complaints were real.\nWell Doug (Collins), is this how you treat disabled Veterans. As “crybaby whiners”. This is why you should be last to be the Sectary of DVA. You finally responded to my request to view these complaints. “Not a positive comment in the bunch of you” makes you look like the biggest “crybaby whiners”.\nThe comments I made are relative to the community care process, not the VA care. The VA has provided excellent care and is my preference. My providers are outstanding and caring and very professional. Unfortunately, the facility doesn’t provide a lot of female care.\nOf course, this will be a reason for misogynists and sexists to vilify female Veterans.\nMy dad died in a VA hospital because of a lack of human resources. He sat in the ER for over 6 hours missing his medical golden window to survive and then spent 30 days in ICU with sepsis where he died. Veterans like my father deserve THE BEST.\nSo why, are so many veterans being intimidated about what they’re doing at their job. So excuse me for not believing a word you say, because you don’t really know it’s not you, is that criminal in the White House Trump and his pet muskrat, that will destroy veterans lives. It already has disrupted them by forcing them to answer by Monday night. I know a lot of veterans at the v. A, that I confused disturbed about what’s going on.So what do you have to say about that\nThank you for the comment. There are plenty of videos and quotes proving how little the current administration cares about veterans and anyone really\nRight on, Thomas! We have a right to ask questions. When I was an NCO, whenever a commander got in front of us for questions, I threw my hand up and encouraged my soldiers to do the same. Let’s keep doing the same thing. We are not a bunch of mindless infants. We are soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that answered the call. Ain’t scared of nothin’!\nThe 1991 agent orange Bill was pass for all Vietnam Veterans that had agent orange Health Problems. in 2002 the V.A said had boot on ground. Congress passed Years later to 12 miles off shore. Many Vietnam Veterans server pass 12 miles but are got agent orange and toxions . Please help us to get the back to the Vietnam service medal like it was in the 1991 agent orange bill for all Vietnam Veterans with Health Problems. Please help us. we are dieing out that need Benefits. that had got Bad Health Problems.

To vote for someone who has absolutely no integrity ,releases criminals from prison because they adore him , which is what he believes we all should do . Because after all he is the king . Money and power for him and his rich supporters is his agenda . The rest of us be damned . Shame on all of you!!\nI’m appalled by this gaslighting and it was a Democratic President that passed the PACT act and has helped veterans immensely and because his son was a veteran, President Biden obviously cared a great deal about us veterans, especially those of us who were disabled. I also remember Senator Bernie Sanders a liberal,(Independent/Democrat) doing a wonderful job when the VA was struggling with backlog by years and even decades in some cases. I myself am still struggling at 70% when they stole my silver fillings and replaced them with the then new composite crap that’s cured with a blacklight. The 70% is for the agoraphobia they caused but they also caused PTSD and aggravated all of the previous to my service, mental health disorders. I feel like they tried to make me a mindless thing they could control and the programming failed if I was 1 of 5 from my squadron all in the hospital the night of the Air Force’s Airman’s Ball with the 17th Commander of the Air Force attending (his wife started the digitized blue, white and gray in all shades ? BDU idea, like people don’t need to “blend” into sky, they’ll be seen, duh ???) for trying to end our lives early. Yeah I know I’m giving to much personal information but it’s partly due to my manic phase I’m in right now.\nHow anyone would trust a man who was well known not to pay his contractors, cheated on all 3 of his wives as an unrepentant adulterer after he vowed to honor and cherish them, lusted after his own daughters (there’s plenty of interviews that are cringe AF with him describing baby Tiffany’s rack size and legs being like Marla’s and the Katie Johnson interview describing her looking like Ivanka and he made her wear a blonde wig when she was with him and to wear gloves so she couldn’t get any DNA from him because he had to see them get destroyed after use, he was careful not to leave behind evidence and she was a Epstein girl and happened to be close to his daughter in age at the time, he also stole her purity according to her account of their last meeting) and y’all think he didn’t and doesn’t LIE to y’all EVERY SINGLE TIME he opens his yuge gaping mouth?\nSir, what you described is literally what the Biden administration and democrats did. President Trump and Mr. Collins have only been in office for weeks, doing more that Biden did in four years. Shouldn’t we wait and give them a chance to set things right again, or are we going to continue to allow our feelings to dictate blame without facts? Personally, I am very confident that President Trump and his cabinet members will do everything in their power to correct what is wrong and then build it back better. Because the majority of the voting population to include a lot of the Democratic legislation are finally acknowledging how criminally unjust he was treated during his first term and are now supporting him. Don’t you think its time to trade our feelings in for observable merit-based accomplishments?\nNO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT CONCURRENT BENEFIT DOUBLE STANDARD …. VETERANS WHO EARNED BOTH DESERVE BOTH\nMr. Secretary,\nYou are not telling the truth; Veteran’s Administration staff are being terminated by email. You know this, if you really stand behind every veteran then you also need to be standing behind every VA staff member who has been terminated by the weakness and constant lying of Donald Trump. Every veteran served by the VA has been on the front line, in harm’s way they trusted the soldier, the marine, the airman, and the sailor next to them. It is time that you not only step forward, that you step up and call out the ignorance that this coming from the White House.\nVeterans have paid the IRS federal & State taxes for many years. I have paid taxes since I was in college until I retired in my 50s. Will veterans who pay no tax on VA benefits get a “DOGE Dividend Check”? I’m certain the IRS used the tax money for fraud, that veterans have paid as civilians, and we deserve a refund, as well.\nJust curious, has our care gone to crap becasue DOGE is trying to make it better? I used to have great care at my local VA healthcare facility. I believe a big chunk of the staff is gone. So how is that helping vets? I think waiting over 2 months for a Urinary Tract Infection is unacceptable. If you look online it states the average wait time to be seen is 2-15 days. Oh, and don’t fall for the lie of using the local urgent cares. The VA doesn’t cover the labs if they decide to do a urinalysis. I paid $149 to pee in a cup of which the VA will not reimburse.\nWell done and well said Mr. Secretary!\n34 years I been waiting on just one ounce of truth behind how I was Deserted in Desert Storm and how the Government has destroyed records and the time is coming to answer to the International Humanitarian and War Crimes major violations. I am an American Fighting Machine I will never give up on Justice or my innocence because I’m an American soldier and veteran. Put your seat belt on Mr. Collins. Because the final battle may come on your watch\nCan you explain how laying off probationary workers and offering buyouts to our underpaid healthcare providers is eliminating waste?\nWe need more people, not less. Instead of letting some kids who aren’t old enough to rent a car screw around with your systems, maybe hire some actual veterans to audit the system who give a shit. You do not have our consent to be doing this and it will come back to haunt you.\nBelieve it when I see it. The president is a lier and has always hated veterans. He avoided service. The idea of privatization of the VA is just a money grab by private insurance companies and private health care. They will deny care and keep our money. The VA isn’t perfect but works leave it alone. Many are happy with it.\nThank you, Doug. My husband is going through the process right now, and we received a phone call just yesterday, and our case is moving forward. Looks like the Democrats are spending every penny they have embezzled on trolls again. The only time I have ever seen attacks like this was after a pro-Trump post in 2017 when they targeted Trump. Just remember that liberals do not like losing power, and they have lost it all. Their following is only about 15% of the population, but their voices are always loud. We are winning. Keep moving forward as fast as you possibly can. All the right people are united in this administration. We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to show the world how wrong the liberals have been. Power and money are all they care about. I’m sure Elon is going to find a great deal of fraud and abuse. That money is for the veterans, and I trust this administration and you to put the funds right back into the veterans’ needs. God bless this administration, and God bless you, Doug. Thank you for stepping up.\nOUTSTANDING reply, Laura!!!\nThe VA does EVERYTHING in Slow Motion. From needing to see a Doctor (several weeks) to getting prescriptions (2 to 3 weeks) New glasses (6 to 8 weeks). God forbid I should get really sick! Someone needs to light a fire under under the VA!\nUs Vets have already shown we are willing to put everything on the line. Now the Rich want to cut our benefits? Lets find out. Glad to know my post will flag me for DOGE or some authoritarian response.\nI received a letter from VA a few days ago telling me that I was over payed in my benefits. The number is quite very high. They didn’t give any time frame of the over payment. I’ve been receiving service connect payments since 1993. What the heck, why did it take this long and why didn’t they give me more indepth information on the matter. All that was said is I owe money and my entitlements will be garnished. Sounds pretty lame to me. Now I have to pony up for a lawyer because VA just can’t get their act together.\nA VA debt waiver is a decision to forgive or cancel a debt owed to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). You can request a waiver if you can demonstrate financial hardship or that repayment would be unfair.\nTo request a waiver:\nComplete and sign VA Form 5655, the Financial Status Report\nWrite a letter on a separate sheet of paper explaining why you should be granted a waiver\nInclude supporting documentation, such as proof of income, assets, and expenses\nSpecify “Waiver” in Block “3” of the Financial Status Report\nInclude your file number and name on each page of documentation\nWhen to request a waiver\nYou have one year from the date you received your first debt letter or copay bill to request a waiver.\nFactors that may help your case: Low income, High essential expenses, Unexpected financial burdens, Inability to pay, and VA errors or misinformation.\nAdditional information\nYou can call the VA Debt Management Center at (800) 827-0648 for questions about benefit overpayments.\nThis is just a complete lie. There is no sense in which arbitrary firings can possibly lead to improved care.\nThere is also absolutely NO plan to *redirect* funds to VETERANS. The only “beneficiaries” you’re talking about are the rich paying less in taxes.\nShame on you. Shame.\nAre you a draft dodger too, Bryan?\nWe hear this all the time; however, the VA has been broken for a long time. I’m not holding my breath. The VA policy is delay, delay. and aways tell you what they can’t do never what you can do . As long as you have clinics like the one in Bismarck ND There are many others, but this one has to be the worst-case of incompetence. Talk is cheap, let’s see if we see any actions. I won’t hold my breath.\nYou will justifiably suffer if you believe you will be told the truth by anyone who has been given position and power under the Musk/Trump administration.\nDoug Collins DID NOT ANSWER the question about Musk&Minions having access to PRIVATE/PERSONAL information as with Medical information–An outright HIPAA Violation!!!! I DID NOT “release” my records to DOGE! Did you???\nThere is NO transparency and/or accountability amongst the lawless incompetents and robber barons accessing veteran/private citizen information via the Department of Veterans Affairs or any other government agency that tRump has opened to a billionaire TechBro that knows he’s buddied up to the perfect ‘mark’ giving him access to Data Mine the entire US Government. INFORMATION is POWER.\nNo doubt this DOGE activity will emerge as the largest (sanctioned) THEFT OF PERSONAL DATA of every Vet/US citizen (for misuse and monetization) in the history of the world. There will be ZERO recourse as all the avenues of reporting and enforcement are simultaneously being dismantled and/or lead by and stocked with tRump/MAGA castrati at the top and lots of sheep in the ranks.\nDoug Collins, Musk and Trump are liars and time (very soon in fact) will tell. The bad thing is our vets will have to pay the price when they have already paid so much to defend this country. Why treat them like they don’t matter.\nDan, your wrong. These people are known liars with intentions to lower the disabled veteran population to reduce the expenses of DVA. Less disabled veterans. My issue is the rest of the republican’s siding tor lies, injustice against the American ways. They are not the Superman’s except in their dreams.\nIt will be 2 decades before republicans can be trusted again.\nI admired Reagan and the Bushes, especially with the concept of “War against terrorism”. These were trusted Republicans. Now they are humbled, by Dictator Putin. What republican now believes Putin did not start the war?\nDoug Collins, prove us wrong and get the current president to promise VA disability, Social Security, and VA health care will not be lessoned like when he wanted to reduce social security to the 100% IU’s on a $ for $ ratio, to pay for his wall. Get the president to promise he will not treat disabled veterans like he did with the Honorable Senator John McCain, the last republican I could trust..\nMake that promise yourself. Promise to follow the Constitution over Trump.\nSorry Dan for the statement that you where wrong. You are right that the vets will pay.\nFWIW Mr Collins, most of us MIL vets don’t believe you have any power – Trump & Musk tell you what to do and you do it or get fired. They have demonstrated this thousands of times in the past month.\nAnd worse yet for us and what’s left of the VA you occupy office space at, this article was posted by Wired . com just 2 days ago – “DOGE’s USDS Purge Included the Guy Who Keeps Veterans’ Data Safe Online.”\nI’m a Disabled Veteran & I suppose when I posted the last time it got moderated…..but all of us Veterans need to think about all of the Employees @ DVA & thier Families that got walking papers and will not have a paycheck next month…..Really Sad for all involved…. Be Blessed\nMr. Collins…I very much liked your plain and to the point INTRO to believe! As DIS VET myself, it took me 11 years to convince the VA that a documented service connected disability was warranted coupled with my effort to have been massively complicated by attempting to do so via normal mail from an overseas location! I would like to see the VA promoting solid guidelines to the federal managers/selecting officials in the federal employment arena to consider job appointments for jobs applicable to qualified and certified 50% +, disabled VETs!!! Veteran preference is an absolute optional in my subjective opinion…as a Master’s degree holder, re-instatable federal candidate, TS security holder with 25 years+ experience, I quit applying for federal jobs after my 40th attempt!\nSome pretty harsh comments here. Gotta give Secretary Collins credit for not blocking them. But then maybe he didn’t see them, being busy as he must be talking up DOGE and Trump’s accomplishments so far, which can’t be impressive, considering they’ve only had a month to make a mess of things. Personally, I thought VA care improved a lot in the last couple of years, at least it did down here in the Texas coastal bend. Seems not all clinics and hospitals are run equally well. Mr. Secretary, I am sure you are a nice guy and want to give Vets the best care you can, but here’s the rub, your boss doesn’t seem to care much for Vets. Will he stay out of your hair?\nWhy would I believe this lying POS any more than I would believe bone spurs. The draft dodger said he will cut benefits in the V A, Social Security, and Medicare and he is doing it one by one with the help of that illegal immigrant musk. It’s just a matter of time. VA employees are being fired all over the country. They aren’t cutting fat, they’re cutting out the heart and soul of the V A and the country.\nThe “real truth” is my retired Army husband has oxygen tubes follow him around the house and is so disabled he never leaves the house. To get his 40% disability re-evaluated for an increase to 100% or at least 70% would require a 3 hour trip each way to Winston-Salem even though we are only 40 minutes from the Durham VAMC. He can’t even leave the house but a long trip is required. Retired Army were promised health care for life.\nThe last time we went to Durham VAMC he had to wait in the car for ten minutes because they ran out of wheelchairs. Civilian doctors say he needs a motorized wheelchair and home health care, but the home health care company needs orders from his VA physician and say his doctor doesn’t respond. I’ve called many times trying to get his physician to put in the orders. They say they relay messages but they never respond. It’s obviously due to cutbacks and poor organization since the last election.\nMr. Collin’s, you should be wearing a diaper on your chin for all the shit you are talking. They are cutting Veteran Employees who served in the military. If that is not a cut to the hard working veterans that served. You sir are just another Trump and Musk disappointment.\nAs a disabled Viet Nam war veteran, I have found the VA to be very good for all of the needs my condition requires. After discussions with the American Legion rep I found that many of the problems vets are having getting the care they need comes from failure to follow the rules in applying for and keeping up with the requirements of the VA. The other problem I see in all of these comments are the failures of the writers to show respect by making demands on others when they have not complied with the requirements properly. If you are confused or think it is too difficult, then contact your Legion rep and ask for assistance. Also, anyone who thinks that denigrating and disrespecting our President will help them, they are mistaken. Ask the Desert Storm vet who rode home on Trump’s plane whether they think he is not a good person.\nOUTSTANDING reply, Don!! There sure are a whole bunch of brainwashed, Communist CRYBABIES on here for the past couple of days, aren’t there??! I find it very hard to believe that most of them ever truly served our Republic in the United States military. If they really did, they sure aren’t displaying the characteristics one would expect from Warrior veterans!!\nNo cuts to VA staff or benefits? Unbelievable that our own Secretary is trying to have us believe this nonsense.\nI live in the Worcester, Mass. VA service area and was unable to see my Primary Care Physician on the two occasions I called for an appointment in the past 4 weeks. When I finally was able to reach someone in authority at the Worcester VA, that person explained that Worcester was experiencing sever Staff shortages and appointments for urgent care were being redirected to the ER’s in the area as well as commercial Urgent Care facilities. Ever try to get chronic disease related care at your neighborhood Urgent Care facility of ER? If you are near death due toa coronary issue or perhaps a stroke they are pretty good…but honestly they don’t really care about RSV or Sinusitis…both of which were misdiagnosed while I suffered with both for 4 weeks until I finally found a specialist through Community Care and was treated with antibiotics..cleared the sinusitis in two days. No reductions in VA care for Veterans? Nonsense…and shameful.\nSounds reassuring, seeing is believing.\nIt doesn’t matter where you go, you can’t escape chronic TDS. And frankly I’m beyond sick & tired of those more ons. It’s only the bottom of the first inning yet they’re already predicting the game is lost. Go away, PLEASE.\nI am glad to have seen the time come when veterans that have served this country get the care and benefits that they deserve and have been promised for years. The VA system is broken and needs restructure. Put administrators and department heads on a fixed salary that is appropriate to their skills, and expertise. Do away with the bonus system of saving money for the VA. Remember the VA is supposed to serve the veteran. It should not be about administrators and department heads withholding services and medical supplies to the veteran in the name of saving money and getting a bonus for themselves.\nDoctors and practitioner’s need not be sitting at their desk looking at the clock when the veteran is their to be treated. If additional medical staff needs to be hired, hire them. Spend some of that money that normally goes in the pockets of administrators and department heads in the name of boniness’s, in the name of money saved and cost reduction\nMake the system of filing for disability more efficient and in a timely manner instead of just “rubber stamping” denied to his or hers claim hoping that they will get discouraged and go away. Or even just die.\nOne other item that is important to me and most veterans i am acquainted with, is the prescribed drug program. If the veteran needs a particular drug made by a particular pharmaceutical company, prescribe that drug to him or her. Don’t prescribe a lesser quality drug instead. Which I have experienced personally. And address the issue of having the veteran pay for drugs, or even a portion of the cost. Remember the veteran has written a check to the Government that has no expiration date or amount on it. Giving his or her life for this country. What I have stated here are situations I have personally experienced and true to my knowledge.\nSo I would ask that the new head of the Veterans Administration, being a veteran himself, take these comments by this veteran into his consideration.\nYeah, no, the DOGE team shouldn’t have access to anything. To lie and claim they do not have access to the health records is laughable. They have access to our records. Also, they made sure the VA is an unsafe environment for LGBTQ veterans.\nGod bless you Sir, and God bless President Trump too. Clean it up please. Too many of my brothers and sisters have been waiting far too long for adequate physical rehabilition and/or adequate medical care. The disability review and decision process needs to be examined for more efficiency no doubt as well. Thank you Sir.\nLying puppet of the administration. Get bent, tool!\nThere is a reason he releases videos through youtube, and that is to circumvent actual reporters who might call out his blatant lying.\nI am sorry but when they fire the people that are in charge of our nuclear weapons and struggle to find them to hire them back is not a media problem. It doesn’t take a genius to know that if you are firing thousands in days you are not putting much thought in what you are doing. When you are telling people they are being fired for performance issues and your supervisor is telling you that is not why you are being fired. It creates a problem. There has been no time for performance issues to be evaluated on thousands of people. It’s not what DOGE is doing, it’s how. You people at the top will never get it. Thanks for trying to quell our fears but I am not feeling quelled.\nI see mostly sour grapes coming from what i believe to be disgruntled democrats. As far as I am concerned the VA is a god send for myself and vets who can still think for themselves and not be one of the bleating sheep who drank the joe and kalama kool aid\nAnything will be an improvement. My 95 year old mom has been waiting to see if she can get Aid and Attendance in Virginia since last March. Supposedly you expedite claims for those over 85 yrs old., if this is the fast track, lord help those younger. I guess you are hoping she will die first.\nHi, Betty. Thanks for commenting.

Now, I see\nall the comments…And I “KNOW!” of many, many veterans who VOTED FOR TRUMP. I said, this guy, with his\nrecord and his philandering….his treatment of General MILLY, his treatment of General H.R.

Now suck it down……….\nCan’t cut what they don’t give. Veterans are not taken care of\nI do not DOGE anywhere near any of my information in the VA database. Doge is not House or Senate appointed or established entity and Elon Musk is not an elected official with legal rights and responsibilities for any of the actions he has been undertaking.\nIrene A. Abels, CDR, USNR, Ret\ni would rather you be focused on HELPING the veterans. not pushing your own numbers….\nIts why i am continually failing to recieve proper treatment, with BLOOD IN MY STOOL, and BLOOD IN THROW UP. Yet its not worthy enough to help a 100% disabled vet\nno…. no…… Cases. cases. cases. number number number\nMark my words……………….. I will die from this illness from lack of treatment, and then my autopsy and written testament will be plastered all across the country\nHi, Jared.

Its going to take Congress to stop these cuts they are all to spineless to do their jobs but even if they took trump to the Supreme Court we all already know what the Supreme Court thinks too.\nThis is Trump’s agenda for the VA…\nTo revamp the Department of Veterans of Affairs with proposals to increase privatization, narrow the eligibility criteria for health benefits and replace civil service-style employees with political appointees in its ranks. – he basically wants to make money off denying care. Kinda like united health (whose CEO was recently gunned down) And to turn the VA into an extension of MAGA.. as in hire January 6er’s instead of career civil servants..\nThank you for looking out for veterans and their families and caregivers. I have been taking care of my 100% disabled vet since 1999. In 2000 he had a major stroke. During the next 20 plus years, hip replacements, open heart surgery and now suffering from dementia, parkinsonism, diabetes. I gave up my retirement money to help raise our children and in down payment for our home. He volunteered at an adult day care where he was placed to recover from the stroke until the last few years. The only retirement I have is Social Security and a small one from Wells Fargo. I just learned of the caregiver program about a year ago where I was able to get the stipend. My husband collapsed in our living room last December–heart failure–he is now in a nursing home (not a very nice one–none want to contract with the VA cause they do not pay enough). I now have to make a 40 mile trip (one way) to visit him. 3rd UTI and hospitalization since being there. Wehn he passes away, his disability pay from the VA and SS will be taken away along with the stipend. I will then have to apply for survivor benefit–which is not even half of his disability pay. In addition, last March he was diagnosed with arterial dementia and the VA supplied a wheelchair and walker. I knew I would be responsible for hauling him to appointments etc….and my 2006 vehicle was too small–so I purchased a 2020 vehicle that had more room. Now I am left with not even half the income and car and house payment (yes we purchased a different home as stairs in our split entry were too hard for him–so we got a rambler). I wish they would eliminate the survivor benefit for those married to vets long term and just let them at least keep the disability pay–sort of a retirement plan for caregivers. I hope you will consider this. It has been a difficult road for us.\nThe VA has been good to me. I have a good doctor from India. A concrete truck hit me from behind and I got surgery to correct a hernia. I fell 19 feet and cracked ribs and had a collapsed lung…the VA paid for the hospital and treatments. I would have been 5 figures in debt to the hospital if I didn’t have VA benefit. I consider myself lucky, most people have to pay horrendous amounts of money on insurance, and for the many things their insurance company refused to cover. I did complain when I first got into the VA because it takes so long for appointments, but I changed my tune when the VA stepped up to cover my emergencies.\nThank you, I think we all need to hear the real truth and not rumors. The main sream media likes to spead rumors just to get everybody all worked up. Again thank you and the VA to taking care of us Veterans. And I would like to send a BIG THANK YOU out to all those employees that are taking care of us, they are always courteous and caring to us.\nI and many others appreciate the efforts of ALL within the VA that strive to assist veterans. Thank you to ALL within the VA doing so much to help us in many ways!!!\nI don’t trust anything you say.\nComing from the state that you used to represent, I find you to be a very partisan politician.\nAs VA Secretary, I was hoping to hear something out of your mouth that didn’t sound like we are stupid and not smart enough to research facts. Instead we got a political soundbite.\nTime will tell what happens to us all.\nThe doctors at the VA Medical Center in Birmingham, AL said that they are worried – they’re hearing that VA Centers are going to be closed and many doctors and nurses are going to lose their jobs. Also, I have confidence that President Trump will keep his promise. The Biden admin gave VA money allotted them by the federal gov’t to Mayorkas to use for illegals. Our SS money has also been used for illegals. If people are given checks because DOGE has found fraud and abuse, then please give the same to our veterans. Social Security was in a private trust acct until Pres. Johnson used it for the Vietnam War – it continues to be in the general fund and is being used for anything they want. It’s so amazing how the Biden admin ignored any laws they didn’t like and broke them. Also, those who are slamming Pres. Trump for not being in the military – neither was Obama or Kamala Harris. I didn’t hear anyone saying anything negative about them – at all. President Trump will make this country operate as it should – he’s a business man who knows exactly how things should be done – fraud and abuse of taxpayer money isn’t going to fly with him.\nSo far I have been shown NO reason to believe we vets will not be targeted. Especially the disabled. There are changes that really need to be made. Start with Congress and their leadership abilities, moral and financial. I expect this will be be deleted.\nTo those pushing the “Leave a comment” conspiracy theories…the majority of negative comments are real and heartfelt. Veterans and retirees have always felt as if they were battling to obtain healthcare, especially for service connected conditions. They support system has perpetually lagged behind our nation’s desire for a capable and forward deployed military. It is not the general fault of an existing or prior administration. However, and with emphasis, there has never been an internal assault on our military operations and support systems as we have witnessed in the past couple months. I wont delve into the detrimental effects on other Federal entities…but they are all connected. VA healthcare is being negatively impacted, and political mouthpiece gaslighting cannot allay our concerns.\nYou get what you vote for…just dont complain about it after the fact.\nPlease add dental care to the Care in the Community program. Delta Dental insurance costs over $53.00 per month and offers only partial coverage for fillings, crowns and bridges. The VA does not offer dental care except for rare service related problems. I know veterans that avoid social interactions because of the poor quality of their teeth. Thanks.\nYou wrote: “Secty. Collins said. ‘In fact, we are actually giving and improving services.'”\n“He went on to emphasize that the Veterans Benefits Administration is clearing cases faster than ever and that VA remains mission-focused by doing what it is supposed to do.”\nGood, but not good enough. At a regional VA medical center town hall this week too many veterans complained of delay and inaction on their cases. My personal experience is PACT Act claims procedures need improvement. This was affirmed in Congress with proposed legislation last session to additionally resource VA claims processing but it was not fully voted on. There are too many processing errors due faulty procedures and rework is 3x as costly as getting it right the first time. Clearing a case is not a measure of success when the final disposition is incorrect.\nThat’s great thanks. But I think it is somewhat over-kill. There are a lot of problems and I am not happy with the VA, so many things I won’t even get into here.\nMy biggest concern though is and has been Why I have zero Dental coverage.\nThe other issues will work themselves out in the coming years.\nThank You\nAnd President Donald J Trump\nGod Bless\nI just don’t believe him. The 20 somethings with no military background will cut as they see fit and whether on purpose or accidentally benefits/services will be reduced. Will sooner rather than later. It will come like a thief in the night but be assured it will happen. If they can fire leadership, cutting services will occur. When your benefits are delay remember his comments.\nI have been at the VA 3 times since the election everyone is positive and looking for bigger and better. Doug Collin’s has been the head of the VA for what three weeks and he has communicated to the Veteran twice . I can’t even tell you who led prior … I have been involved with the VA since I got out of the Army in 1971…. I have good stories and HORROR stories … So let’s look for success\nYou talk the talk, NOW WALK THE WALK\nCome on my fellow VETERANS, how about giving the new SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS the opportunity to prove what he has said. Before you get on my case, I was drafted on Jan 17,1966 and sent to South Vietnam on Dec. 1, 1966.\nWhile there I went hospital twice. First time had a hernia the size of an ostrich egg. Second time,malaria two other tropical deseases, worms, and my temp hit 104.9 degrees. The only thing I currently qualify for is PTSD @70%.\nI also meet those other listed requirements, but have been denied compensation for them.\nThe VA DOESN’T DO THE INITIAL EXAMINATION OF CLAIMS ,THEY USE DOCTORS GROUPED UNDER THE VETERANS EVALUATION SERVICES! A doctor in Maryland decided that I didn’t meet the VA ‘s standards! I LIVE IN LOUISVILLE KENTUCKY , I HAD NO INTERACTION WITH SAID DOCTOR!\nNot Sure I can believe this. The present administration is fire-bombing most federal offices with major firings and layoffs across the board, including at least 1,000 in the Veteran’s Administration. I contacted my local VA Medial Center’s administrative office to ask about buyouts affecting staffing levels in the VA healthcare system and was told that, while buyouts were offered, medical staff was exempt and could not take advantage of the buyout. Still not sure how support staff, administrative staffing, etc. would be affected. The person I talked to said that there were still questions, particularly about any future actions. I guess we will have to wait and see what the future of VA medical care will look like. As a Vietnam Vet on disability, I am very concerned and this Rah, Rah speech didn’t do much to ease my mind.\nSecretary Collins,\nIn your video, you stated, “I’m happy to partner with them [Musk’s DOGE team] to find things we need to get rid of so we can put the money where it belongs… back with our Veterans, …”\nFirst, you must rely on the outstanding professionals in the VA’s Office of the Inspector General. Those folks know what to look for, honed by years of collective experience in the organization. Your existing VA OIG team, not some group of uncleared people unfamiliar with the internal and, often, legally required processes of the VA, are the BEST to continue their diligence in finding better ways to carry on the VA mission. They are your most valuable resources for improving the VA and investigating and uncovering fraud and corrupt practices; that is what you are looking for. Further, your statement “…find things we need to get rid of…” speaks volumes about someone with little experience in the processes and practices involved. The key to gaining efficiency and effectiveness is not to “get rid of” but to find ways to IMPROVE the quality and the processes that help achieve the mission. As long as your “partners” try to trash a system they don’t understand, there can never be acceptable change for the better. You must realize that the people you call partners, including the president, do not have the best interests of Veterans in mind – he has already called us “suckers” and “losers.” You better get this straight: we are neither. We have defended our nation against threats like this before and will again. We are Veterans, and we Vote.\nThank you!!\nI have a tough time understanding all the comments regarding mistreatment by the VA. I am USAF Veteran in the upper Midwest, I have nothing but good to say about the treatment I have received. It’s either me or just there are different VA’s out there. I am more than please with the VA. Thank you…keep it up!\nThanks Doug\nVETERNS NEED HELP WITH VA AND COMPENSATION- VETERN GOES TO IRAQ 2004-2005 ATTACHED TO 1ST ID QUARTER CALVES AT FOB MACKENZIE COMES HOME HAS A WIDOW MAKER AT 47 ANOTHER HEART ATTACK A MAJOR STROKE A SEIZURE BUT THE VA CAN NOT HELP HIM VA CAN NOT LINK ALL THIS TOGETHER. VETERN HAS NOT WORKED OVER A YEAR BECAUSE HIS CONDITION BURN PIT OINLY GETS 10% A JOKE EXPLAIN TO THIS VETERN WHY NO HELP VA SERVICE OFFICER WITH CLAIMS QUOTE THE BS RULES AN REGULATIONS VA SAYS NOT SERVICE CONNECTED VETERN NATIONAL GUARD FILES FOR PTSD VA CLAIMS TOLD HIM HE WAS NATIONAL GUARD DID NOT QUALFI FOR PTSD WHY\nThis is the classic Republican response when they want to cut spending:\n“We need fetter out any fraud, waste, and abuse. ”\nAnd yet, it is Republican run government programs where fraud, waste and abuse exist!\nFor instance, Republican supporters on this forum claim that fraud, waste and abuse exist evidently in the VA!! So OK you folks, can you point out anything you have seen or found in the VA system that is fraudulent, waste or abuse? I want facts baby and not your assumptions! My VAMC is great and takes care of all of my health problems. Hardly if ever had any problems with their servicing me! It seems that every Republican administration-Congress always tries ways to cut spending from the VA! Any anytime budget considerations come up VA funding-wise, they find excuses to vote against them. In reality, the VA medical system would not exist if not for Democrats!\nAnd please don’t give me this all liberals are communist bull! With Trump basically in bed with Putin, Xi and Kim Un, you know how he says he has love affairs with them, well–face it–they are all real communists. And anyone here who supports Putin and Russia (really still the Soviet Union) is in fact a communist or a communist sympathizer! And right now, its Republicans who fall into the communist category! It is the Republican party that does not want free and fair elections and supports a wanna be autocratic dictator in Trump! Trump has always said he wants to rule like Putin, and he sure as heck is trying really hard to do so!\n“We need fetter out any fraud, waste, and abuse. ” Hmm.\nI would like to see the exact cases made for each fired VA member accuse of “any fraud, waste, and abuse”. These employees need to be given the facts rather than the opinion of DOGE or the president. Did they provide specific incidences or just told them you loss because we suspect you of “any fraud, waste, and abuse”. Where is the Due Process within the Constitution that Trump himself applied to himself?\nThe Fraud part is at the top, with the person who got the due process and was guilty of Fraud. It is his second nature. To commit fraud is to lie. Therefore, Trump is a proven liar, and he will lie about his lie, like the Big Lie he did not lost to Biden.\nDoug Collins, prove Daft-Dodger Trump is not a liar. Prove to us that you served in the military and actually care for the disabled veterans. It is on you. If you do not respond here, then you show your lack of respect for people who served in the military., and people will not trust you.\nYeah? And trump said Medicaid wouldn’t be touched hours before endorsing a house plan to gut medicaid.\nI sure hope you’re willing to fight for this nation’s veterans Mr. Collins.\nHopefully, but time will tell. For those concerned with their information… really? Come on, your on the Internet answering this message and more than likely on social media, your information has been bought and sold long before DOGE had anything to do with it. The Patriot Act guaranteed that. Google and Meta are the ones you need to be concerned with.\nThe malpractice this administration is going to commit and the expense of veterans do to extreme incompetence and narcissism is going to be devastating and you, sir, are complicit and will be held accountable.\nWas this message put out before or after they decided to cut 1000 employees at the VA Administration..?? The date is the same.\nI, for one, am so glad that Doug is at the helm. Right man for the job, in my books.\nMr. Collins, please take a moment and actually listen to the people that are doing the job in C&P and see how it can be improved. There is still a backlog, these workers just got off mandatory overtime due to reduced backlog. Now with the firing/buyout there is a known fear that they will experience another backlog. Because whom is going to do the jobs of those people you let go? Then when those persons that are left to cover their work and those who left, and fall behind, then they are in fear of getting put on PIP and losing their job! The PTSD/Anxiety associated with helping veterans as a many are veterans of not knowing if you are getting a letter for firing, is unfair to those whom serve to serve others. THE BACKLOG IS NOT CAUGHT UP, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE AND THEY SAID THAT IS NOT THE CASE. Someone is fudging numbers!\nPlease listen to those persons who are doing the job, not the GS 14s and up, heck too many of them!!! if 19, 20 years olds can work for DOGE, clearly you can listen to the GS 12s and below. Heck, I have a few names to improve the processing!\nWhile you are at it, can we get 2 increases a year, or 5% will truly assist us!! TOO MANY Chiefs at the VA and that is a fact jack!! too many petty managers that will fire hard workers because NOW they can for their own personal agendas.\nNo one should be allowed to touch veterans benefits or to privatize the VA hospital. It’s quite alarming that the two people who wants to cut our benefits never served in the military.\nDon’t believe you.\nI won’t file a claim because of the Hassel I have to go through, I’m a Vietnam Vet and desert shield Veteran, Please cut all the red tape.\nIf there are ANY interruptions to my benefits, Doug Collins, I will hold you personally responsible. There will be no explanation that will satisfy. Cooperation with DOGE is all the proof I need to know who to blame. And I think I speak for many Veterans when I say, “The only thing I have left to lose is my benefits.”\nI’m excited that the President and Mr Collins are working together. I believe what Mr Collins stated. We have enough negative comments coming from the Democrats and the fake Media. They lie with no shame. President Trump is the best President in my lifetime and I served under President Nixon. Great things are going to happen in President Trumps watch.\nSecretary Collins,\nWith all due respect the VA needs to decentralize it’s VA Hospital management. Directors should be free to make whatever changes they feel need to be made without having to check with their boss who has to check with his boss. As a 20+ year volunteer and patient I have witnessed first hands this absurdity. Let managers manage and if they cannot, counsel, retrain and if necessary fire.\nPLEASE REMOVE THE PHRASE BELOW FROM THE HIRING PROCESS. This statement is embedded into every Veteran’s healthcare job posting.\nPursuant to VHA Directive 1193.01, VHA health care personnel (HCP) are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 subject to such accommodations as required by law (i.e., medical, religious or pregnancy). VHA HCPs do not include remote workers who only infrequently enter VHA locations. If selected, you will be required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and submit documentation of proof of vaccination before your start date. The agency will provide additional information regarding what information or documentation will be needed and how you can request a legally required accommodation from this requirement using the reasonable accommodation process.\nAnnouncement #: CBTA-12690744-25-MTS\nThank you.\ni am a vietnam veteran and very happy to see the changes being directed to more services for our veterans 58,000 of my brothers sacrificed on that battle field they deserve the benefits they have for us it has been a long fight but it was woth it for the soldier who tookhis life at the trump tower was sending a clear message we need more or better services my prayers and thoughts go his family\nOkay, Please ‘listen’ to his statement. “Veterans benefits aren’t getting cut.” Maybe; but where they are going to slice and dice the VA, is reduction in VSRs, ratings staff for compensation, medical staff, hospitals and clinics. DOGE is looking for the “waste” in gov’t contracts, e.g., assistance with transportation, cuts or elimination of travel pay, costs shares will skyrocket up for medical needs, and we will pay for it out of OUR own pockets.\nMr. Secretary,\nI aske for proof VA appointment would not take longer to make. You did not respond.\nI asked you to guarantee VA and Social Security would not be lost on a dollar for dollar ratio as Pres. Trump attempted in his last term. You did not respond.\nI asked you to ask the president to promise VA health care, disability and social Security would not be negatively affected. You did not respond.\nI asked you to respond to all comments listed here on this page. You did not respond to my comment, did you respond to others?\nI asked you to not affect to retribution for these complaints on this site. You did not respond to me.\nI can only believe everyone comments will be used to lower all health care and disabilities from veteran complainers on this site. You collected our names.\nAs the president wanted to publish the name of anyone involved with the Jan 6 investigations, are you collecting name for retribution?\nPlease respond to each complaint and suggestion listed here. Assure VA will not be affected and the disabled veterans here will not be negatively affected. Ask the president to promise us. Until then, faith in you is not real. The news uses facts (except Fox uses hearsays). The president and staff uses innuendoes and hearsay, with lies.\nBe not one of these and protect disabled veterans and assure us what you are doing is authentic. Get the president to promise us. You promise us. You respond to all complaints positively. Or faith in you is not real.\nThere are 1679 comments on this site at the time of this comment. None show a response from you. Are you listening or is this a waste of time to you? I can only expect the worse since you wont truly assure us disabled veterans.\nNo response from Doug Collins yet.\nFirst, Mr. Collins, Secretary of Veterans Affairs. YOU ARE AWESOM, Thank you for taking on this responsibility, and We notice alreay a HUGE difference in Improvement since President Trump took office, and with you there.\nI’m also a consultant, and noticed a Lot of waste with paper being used and sent with Prescriptions. Rather than sending us Lots of paper that adds to the weight of postage, how about allowing us to just go onlinie since that info is already there.\nYou sound like a political hack!!!\nHow is cutting the VA workforce going to help us vets? The answer is IT IS NOT!\nLess people doing more work does not equal better care!\nDo your actual job – Serving us Vets & not Trump or DOGE.\nAre you trying to reassure us or go on a rant about the “media”? Very unprofessional and NOT reassuring.\nThey have a lot of political propagandalists in this forum. They only believe what they hear from others. The hackers only want to find out who is draining the coffers,If you are one then, you have a reason to bitch. If not then all the years in the military should have weaned you from the political tit and shit show. Its always been a SNAFU and until they let someone get it right it will be the same. The demo/socialists destroyed, piledged and stole from the US coffers and person that dont need your money are trying to fix it. Most of the persons on the cabinet are ex patriots or rich enough to not get paid for their service. Why the hell would they do that for US? I dont feel its a gainful reason to eliminate waste from a government that taxes the shit out of you, no matter how much money you make.\nI’m reading a lot of complaining, as usual. So let me say this. For YEARS, I have received VERY GOOD overall healthcare from my local VA. It’s much better care than civilian insurance plans that I’ve had in the past. ALL personnel have been nothing but pleasant and helpful during all of my visits. Thank you, VA.\nHaving endured pay delays and other suffering due to political budget shenanigans, it is hard to believe that DOGE led by an unelected official with no public accountability interference in VA management will benefit veterans. For decades Republicans and their wealthy supports have sought to privatize or deregulate government affairs to the detriment of the military, veterans, and the public.\nIts an awesome team that the greatest president of the US history has put together to gitter done. I really hope its not just another fight between political opposition.\nWas at the CBOC in Cottonwood,AZ and the picture of our President Trump was not up either, I see this may be happening across the country.\nI have told all of my Veterans that the Pact Act had no money behind it, as anyone that met the requirements the VA gave 0 % which means no compensation but they would take care of you medically. That is all it was good for.\nI have been a volunteer Accredited Claims Agent/ VSO for over 20 years. the biggest problem I think will save funds and a few trees is in the mailing. When I become a POA for a Veteran, I file the documents and when there is a decision or letter that needs to go to the Veteran, It is also in his electronic file that the Claims Agent can see in VBMS system. BUT, the VA sends a letter to the Veteran and to the VSO/Claims Agent/ Attorney who ever the POA is. This is not necessary as the VSO has it in front of them on the computer. Thousands and thousands if not millions of these secondary letters are sent for no reason.\nMaybe this will save a lot of funds and the eqrth.\nYOU CAN NOT BE CARING FOR VETS IF YOU LET A BONE SPUR COMMANDER IN CHEIF AND HIS hERMAN gOERIENG PARTNER RUN THE AXE OVER YOU YOU NEED TO STAND UP FOR VETERANS AS THEY ARENOT. OR ARE YOU IN LINE WITH HIS GOALS TO PUNISH US TO PAY FOR HIS TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH????\nThanks for the RIGHT information.\nSecretary Collins,\nIn your video, you stated, “I’m happy to partner with them to find things we need to get rid of so we can put the money where it belongs… back with our Veterans,”\nFirst, you must rely on the outstanding professionals in the VA’s Office of the Inspector General.

We are Veterans, and we Vote.\nI called the phone number and a very nice young man named Kent took my suggestion and said he would pass along. Thank you Kent\n“clearing cases quicker then ever” yeah by denying them! waited 5 years for my cancer claim to be denied!\nglad i was hit with DU, got cancer and having the VA at least pay for my treatments….\nI am not sure I believe you. We have heard too many times that this won’t happen or that won’t happen in other areas and then jobs are cut. I also know President Trump has always wanted to privatize services, including Veterans Health Services. One stop shopping and home and community-based services streamline veterans’ health services by consolidating them into one facility. You and President Trump should pay a visit to the Veterans Administration and Hospital in Kansas City, MO. It is efficient, wait times to get services and in to see medical providers are optimum, we are treated with respect, always thanked for our services, and get good mental health and physical care. Contractors and sub-contractors are currently providing jobs to over 100 workers to build an annex to move all the administrative staff from downtown KC to the new location upon its completion. The VA has already seen cuts and there has been a hiring freeze for six years. Veterans cannot afford to have to go to various doctors and specialists in the community as many cannot, or do not drive and Medicare premiums would be costly.\nWho is to find “things we need to get rid of”? I feel certain that it is not a Veteran and if they are do they get their care through VA? I doubt it on both counts. How about you do something radical and ask those who go to the VA for what is and is not helpful. Do not just chose by cost and money, the way the current crew works, it’s all about money, ande them having it, not those who need it. May our democracy, country and VA survive.\nYea, right, after 40,000 lies from dump you want me to believe that a man appointed by a draft dodging traitor is looking out for my best interest. Bullshit.\nWhy is it taking so long to get disabilities evaluated?\nThe gulf war veterans need the VA Secretary Collins help in our quest. 2-21-2025 2;40 pm\nWhen you deal with bad PLs that do not change, it takes a good staff around the Sec of VA to show executive options. Not rely on Congress to do all the work. The Sec literally has similar powers as a President. So, CFR 38 ss 3.317 does not service connect because of the UDX aspect they could fix that. Gulf war is tied to closely to Undiagnosed Illness, VA countered this by making everything diagnosed even if its wrong.\nSo, it fails at 93% rejection rate which VA loves. All wars should be service connected by time, date, and location. Which they have begun to do with OIF / OEF under the PACT act. Only to find the PACT act exclusionary to 1991 Gulf War vets. it sometimes can literally be the title of the section of CFR 38 that hinders a rating and the ICD codes. Something I tried to fix on a VA federal advisory committee that VA blew off. I did the l same with the PACT act in 2021 when I said in the news media it had loopholes, and by September came the flood of zero ratings. The best most can do is 30% between gulf war and OIF, OEF – zero rating is often the end result. Its not fair.\nThe gulf war veterans need an open-door policy to act on our serious health issues.\nThe Whitehouse hotline and the VA-IG system doesn’t work unless Secretary Collins fixes the complaints system.\nA fast food chain and the health care system for veterans have absolutely 0 in common. It is insulting that the people that choose to care for us as veterans medically are now without jobs, ways to support their families and themselves. As us veterans individually, has any of the actions taken in the last 31 days helped any of us. Ask us. Because when you ask us, you will receive a truthful answer of you are making our healthcare worse, not better. Also a large demographic of employees that you improperly and unjustly fired, are Veterans themselves. You make no sense. You don’t care about us veterans. You make short videos saying nothing. You answer no questions. Show data. Show documentation. Your words mean nothing. Where is the proof to back up your false claims? Where are the receipts? Down right disrespectful. A spit in all of the faces of veterans. Shame on you.\nYea, like we are supposed teo believe you. Retired back in 2008, and still fighting to get benefits that I earned. Why am I having to fight for it? I met all the qualifications for the pact act, had Lymphoma, been to the places listed, and still got denied. PACT act is a crock of lies that the dems made to make it look like they care for veterans when the fact is they don’t, nor do the republicans. Have back issues that I have had ever since I retired, and well, because I never went on sick call for back problems, they didn’t service connect it. Guess it was nice of my back to wait til the week after I retired to start having issues. And those commenting well it takes time, yea I know it takes some time, but, how is it when they send you correspondence, they give you a week to have the proof sent to them or all the sudden they can give you a decision in a short amount of time.\nDear Hank: If you look back you will see that it has always been the Republicans at the White House always hinting at cutting our benefits and Social Security for the elderly. Trump and Elon are Republicans. Also, you might want to try a different avenue of applying for your benefits. I went through a VSO after being denied, while other went through other agencies that try to help veterans get what they deserve without a fee. Some even got lawyers. If you ever complained about your back to a fellow soldier or if they witness an event that probably caused the problem, you can get witness statement from them stating what they saw or heard. Good luck and don’t give up.\nHank, why are you blaming the current admin?? get help resubmitting you request!\nGary\nWhen I was having troubles like yours I went to the American legion. They will help fill out the paperwork and send it to the proper persons. They also have personnel embedded in the va to hurry the process along. Give them a shot they have come through for me several times\nI know that is hard, but it there is a reason I always told me Soldiers, no matter what, go to sick call. I can’t blame the VA for their choice when in fact there is no documents in your records. My bother had the same issue with his knee, never got it looked at, and the VA said nope. Your best bet, is to get letters from people you served with that can contest to your back issues.\nThat’s your problem. To get benefits, your problems HAVE to be service-connected.\nWell let’s see if this comment gets totally censored out like my first two. Under the guise of moderation.\nRetired in 93, finally got a 10% rating last fall. Now I get a small check monthly, oh, but same amount is taken out of my retirement, so potentially I get to maybe save on taxes. Over the years I have known many others who did get disability, strangely, none were retirees, another significant %, well if I comment it would be falsely attacked as lifestyle prejudiced.\nPACT seemed a no brainer. After all my initial claims except 1 were denied, further checking revealed all the denials were done without any medical records, no recognition of RVN service. i had to even get and file copies of all my DD214’s and they still got my periods of service wrong.\nPlease, some improvement definitely needed.\nI would love to believe your comments, but looking at the current administrations ability to speak out of both sides of their mouth, and past/current actions I want to see it before I believe it.\nLet’s talk about cuts or better yet severing an established service connection due to glaring VA errors. Service connection for my sinus cancer was granted and then summarily severed due to the VA erroneously asking provider after provider for an opinion for “skin” cancer rather than my sinus cancer. DBQ Derm does not allow for a positive opinion on a sinus or any other respiratory cancer and as a result my service connection was severed then eventually restored after one provider pushed back stating she could not provide her opinion for a sinus cancer on a DBQ Derm however even though I have clawed my way back to even 100% now I am still waiting for the VA to recognize that my dental issues due to radiation damage that I claimed in October of 2020 are service connected. Cutting out the errors that result in such awful decisions will go a long way to providing better care for all veterans\nIn plain English, does this mean that DOGE has access to my personal health records? If so, I demand access to all the members of DOGE personal records and even Trumpy. They can’t have it both ways.\nI want to know as well. What information are you, Doug, giving them?\nI want to see President Trumps picture hanging on the wall at my VA center in Mobile, Al. It is unacceptable that it’s not up yet. They said they ordered the pictures jan 22,2025… Why?? He was nominated President Nov. 5th. No accuses. I am very upset. Please make that happen yesterday. Thank you\nI’m sure you are looking for his recently released “Long Live the King” photo… We took an oath to the constitution , not some jerk who thinks he can be a king.\nI’ll vote for that.\nDefinitely, should have been waiting in the wings.\nBro, Please re-read your statement. a) it took about two months before Biden’s photo went up. b) “He”, was nominated in July (or August), and elected (won) the presidency on Nov 5. Your putz is getting his face all over the VA soon… sadly.\nThat’s your big concern? Laughable.\nI was at my local VA Office this week. It was a relief not to see his disgusting picture there.\nYou are among the dumbest people on the planet. You are triggered but silly stuff and spend your time online crying about nonsense. Grow up and read a book someday?\nYou Go Mike!!! Let Us know when that happens…\n“No accuses” people are worried about their benefits, they are worried that the government is not holding up their end of the bargain.. and you are upset about King Trumpy’s portrait?\nI totally agree with you\nIs that going to make him more of a president than he already is. Get over it.\nHis picture is hanging in the bathroom.\nYou wont have to worry about anyone’s picture in any office. President musk is closing down all the V A offices in the country. You’re lucky that’s your biggest problem. Most of us have more important shit to worry about.\nIn theory that all sounds great. But based on what is currently happening across the Federal government, I have major concerns.\nFellow veterans, read up on the Bonus Army. (https://department.va.gov/history/100-objects/object-21-bonus-army/)\nTrump and his cronies do not support us, and will do all they can to destroy our military. Here’s what he just did to our top military leadership: https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-fires-the-chairman-of-the-joint-chiefs-fd4a4d07\nStand up and speak out against Trump’s attempt to destroy democracy, Americans.\nYou and Trump are NOT to be believed…you are just one of his sycophant lapdogs who will do ONLY what is directly approved by Trump, his number one Lapdog-e Musk. Trump and Musk will cut our services and those in the VA who provide it. You will only respond by regurgitating whatever talking points provided to you.\nAsk Donnie T. how goes his famous heel spur that his daddy used to keep him away from military service. After all, according to Donnie T.’s own words that we–those who served are “suckers” and “losers”.\nNOTE Also: Musk is a native South African and immigrant who would not know the first thing about military service, where country comes before self.\nSpread your hate elsewhere! New admin takes time to sort out the mistakes of the previous administration!\nGary\nUSN Ret\nYour ignorance is absolutely breathtaking.\nI have set and read many of the comments and I think it’s hilarious that many of the comments are about having access to your private information. There is no way that you can so naive as to think you have any private information. All private information went away with the invention of the computer and the internet. probably 85% of you use your cell phone for transactions pertaining to money or with all of the little apps installed i.e. Tick Tock which pulls every bit of information off of your phone and sends it to China. the United States is constantly participating in conflict somewhere weather it’s on the news or not. I’m not saying it’s a perfect system but the Politicians that we have and continue to vote into office have done absolutely nothing for more than 50 years while becoming multi-Millionaires on a little more than average salary which the receive for life as well as medical benefits. so, for those complaining about Trumps administration after a month, Go call you Representative (if they’re not out in the street whining and singing like first graders) and ask them why they haven’t worked on this stuff. I spent almost 23 yrs in and have been through 19 surgeries, so I have earned the right to call you out.\nAt the risk of getting on a MAGA-DOGE future revenge list, as a disabled veteran I have to say that this disgusted me. It was purely partisan political apologetics. The “media up here” that he dismisses is doing its job of the Fourth Estate being a watchdog on government actions, and that’s why he has to be defensive. His boss doesn’t care about veterans, having repeatedly and publicly made it clear that he thinks service people who are maimed or killed or POW are suckers and chumps. And this guy should be fired for letting Musk and his DOGE minions into our data: I gave the VA permission to maintain my health care information for its use, I didn’t give it permission to reveal it to an unelected band of idiot thugs to mine. Maybe we were chumps to serve instead of paying quack doctors to certify “bone spurs.”\nMan you really need an attetude check. This news is all old false unfactual garbage.\nThe media were often proved right. While most media are probably biased, so are … who? Trump? DOGE? Absolutely! Cost cutting eliminates potential wasted spending on “loser” POWs and war-injured veterans. (quoting Trump). Sadly, we may all suffer in the end. I heard required follow-ups for suicidal veterans are delayed, sometimes by weeks or months. I’m sure there is waste potential everywhere, but let’s not throw out the baby with the bathwater. Trimming waste is hard work and takes time.\nI’m an army veteran ( peace time). I do have service connection for tinnitus and kidney cancer. Loma Linda VA saved my life. A doctor at Loma Linda said I was cancer-free. I sold my house. I moved to a new state. 6 months later I found out I had blood cancer through a biopsy from the El Paso VA. That was 3 years ago. Zero treatment for my cancer. Zero medication. All my pact act disability claims have been denied by someone in Waco Texas. I live in New Mexico. Oh yeah I’m a retired California state firefighter and EMT. Obviously these knuckleheads are retaliating against me, so I will never receive any of my VA benefits earned. I had to go out and pay for medical insurance just to get sleep medication. I have numerous medical issues and I will never even ask for help from the VA ever again. VA is junk. I recommend the leadership team and doctors and nurses be removed from the El Paso VA medical system indefinitely. The Las Cruces cboc ran by the El Paso VA Medical center is horrible. The nurses there call it the “Sh*t show!” El Paso VA medical system along with the Albuquerque VA medical system has it been a disservice to this veteran since December 2021. I will testify to this any day of the week.\nWritten by an army Cav Scout and retired Cal Fire firefighter and EMT.\nDid you think it’s the VA staff that gets bonuses for turn you down. Here in AL the head of VA disability service was fired a phew years ago because he received a bonuses for the longer wait time. Took 10yrs to get mine, it was in my medical record in black & white. Like you I went 1 1/2 years with cancer my first time before any thing was done. Now just yesterday was dx for my 4 round. Good luck\nHi, Jared. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nWhy is this war hero a POW OF THE VA ADMINISTRATION?\nI know Mr. President Trump cares about very much, and is extremely busy cleaning up ( “finally” ) the mess. I’m hoping you free me so i don’t have to bother him.\nIt’s called being in “Lockstep”, to be in complete agreement or to conform with someone or something else; whether or not it is right or wrong. Did you hear how Virginia is going to financially assist those in their state who have been canned by Trump? It’s NOT the state, rather, it’s TAXPAYERS who are going to have to swallow this! That is, THOSE WHO STILL HAVE JOBS!\nMr Secretary, how do veterans, veteran families and caregivers contact you directly with their concerns? I read the OMB new director Vought’s plans for veterans disabilities. Now I can not steep at night over the worry. Vought is no friend to veterans. I would like to believe you sir , but I am not letting my guard down..\nI don’t believe you, nor do i believe Trump. What i do believe is that you will do whatever it takes to deliver tax cuts for the rich and cut wherever you can to get the funds for those tax cuts.\nSorry you feel that way. As a fellow veteran, you are intitled to feel any way you want. But as Secretary Doug Collins stated, the reality is what actaully happens, not what folks may think or feel.\nDoug Collins knows what he is doing and knows how to do the job of making the VA as lean and efficient as it can be. However, no one is “entitled” to receive something for nothing or take advantage of funds just because they have been allocated. I hope you have a blessed day.\nUgggghhh. …so SORRY to read your comments… hopefully Trump will acquiesce(sp?)/be hands-off. He certainly has many other great achievements/100x’s better than “let’s GO Brandon” as a President.\nThanks for clearing that up. Hurray!!!\n“However, no one is “entitled” to receive something for nothing or take advantage of funds just because they have been allocated. ”\nThis applies to Trump and Musk and the rest of the 1% way more than to ANY veterans receiving benefits or federal employess or other hard working middle class Americans. I hope that what is stated here by Sec Collins is true and that veterans retain their benefits and support from the VA, but it’s hard to ignore what is happening every day and the stories I’m hearing from friends, federal workers and VA nurses being fired without cause. The disruption in people’s lives by all this is real and not positive for them or their families. Why should we believe that we’ll be safe when others are not?\nSorry you feel that way. As a fellow veteran, you are entitled to feel any way you want. Secretary Collins, lied, because DOGE does have access to the medical records. He doesn’t know what he is doing because he has never ran an organization, let alone a government one. Last time we heard the words “Lean and efficient” a lot of veterans lost access to care. I guess you support that kind of thing though. Also, NO ONE IS TAKING advantaged of any funds that were allocated by CONGRESS. Love your gaslighting.\nFred,\nYou’ve been duped, pal. (Unless you’re lying on purpose. ?♂️)”Probationary” doesn’t mean “new”. A lot of skilled career employees – veterans included – are being summarily canned because the incoming regime wants to assert dictatorial power and give tax cuts to the rich. It’s not to benefit us, and there’s not even any way it *could*.\nTrump just called himself king! Wake up already. If you still hold to the Constitution we all swore to defend, then there is no excuse for you to be repeating this nonsense. The truth is out there, and the proof is a search query away.\nI appreciate the change from the new Secretary and look forward to the new concern for Vets. I am a vet, 80 years old and the only benefit I have used was when I bought my first home in 1973, I am fortunate.\nThey are looking to get rid of Medicaid funding. So, all vets with certain conditions living in elderly homes will not have the ability to pay and stay. A daughter of a vet suffering from alzheimer, whose home costs $16,000 a month, is scared for her dad. Medicaid pays 1/4 of the bill every month, and they can’t afford to take up the cost. There is no new concern for Vets. If you cut employees, all VA interactions will take longer.\n“I only used my benefits to purchase a home when they costed 10k, shame on other vets who need services. Only for me but not for thee”\nI completely agree, that is what his first term was all about, tax cuts for the rich. I wish some people would read ACTUAL news and NOT just your right wing echo chamber where you hear what putin wants you to. When will they realize ALL cult leaders are evil?\nWe are all just frogs in a pot now. Some of us can can feel how bad the situation is getting, and some of us will deny to the end that there’s anything wrong with Trump’s moves to consolidate power and remove all checks on that power. Putin’s Russia is his model, and we are heading that direction quickly. Surface level freedoms to preserve the charade is all we’ll be left with while the billionaires loot everything else.\nLike what Mr. Collins had to say, and I liked the way he said it. Direct and to the point in language you could understand. Not a lot of blah, blah, blah and say nothing.\nYes, very direct, but was it the truth?\nI Love it.\nSir,\nI’m attaching a picture of a woke hallway in St. Cloud VA\nDon’t know what woke is do you?\nWhat is “woke”? You explain that to me…is it so called ‘woke” because you don’t agree, or is it because something just might be true! I am a veteran just like everyone on this chat, I’ve this before just like many of you have but I guess depending on what side of the aisle you sit on will determine how you comment. Every chat always begins with the issues then it turns into a political blame game, or who is oh so great. Politicians are all about “self”, and people are perfectly fine with things that happen or don’t happen until it affects them, then it’s the other parties fault…aren’t you tired?\nAccording to the US Office of Personnel Management, military veterans made up about 30% of federal employees in 2021, and many of them had service-related disabilities.\nThis entire administration is complicit in mass firings of veterans. They don’t respect us. They don’t care for us. They don’t work for us.\nAll of you who believe they do and support them are guilty.\nIm sorry that many of you think this is twitter. One line commentary.\nYour going to turn VA off, and they want this. To make this location\nthe scape goat to shut down future channels.\nSome folks caught on and wrote there public letters to the Sec of VA.\nThat this is a public soap box. Others think a ugly or vulgar one liners\nis all that is needed. Those are the ones going to get us call cut off.\nDont blow your only chance to be heard other than knee jerk reactions and\nspew pointless remarks. There isnt anything else left and VA wants to\nshut this down too. So they claim people are rude, and so they can go\non ignoring us. Already trying this at the other sec post location.\nIf you have nothing, stand by some of these other people who wrote\nparagraphs of interesting materials. Show them some support. Reply to\nthem and show some form of unity.\nUnity on something, anything. All of you agreeing on one idea would\nchange everything. Not even a person, just the idea. Areas that could\nchange if you all said it together.\nCan go on 1 thousand one liners, or all of you saying one common idea\nat a time till VA deals with it. Vote as a group. Take charge. Get past the\npersonality part, focus on content. Something simple, super easy. Like\nopen door policy so you can be heard.\nVA wants to say it lost control here, dont let them. Its already showing at\nthe VA Secretary Doug Collins addresses Veterans benefits rumors in latest\nvideo. VA wants this quiet again, no problems. Silent hallways.\nRealize what is happening here. Censorship is already raising its ugly head.\nYeah…and our social security is safe too…President Musk will take his chain saw to all the benefits of Americans paying taxes, while the Manchurian Candidate Trump serves as the puppet!\nHistory has proven ithat if lies are told often enough, they become truth. SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS!\nThis guy is lying to us.\nHe’s not to be trusted. Now he’s also looking at ways to privatize our care – in the false interest of “efficiency” – when in reality it’s all about shifting the money to private insurance where we know care-denials are rampant and 21% is siphoned directly off of the top for overhead,\nFor a guy who has been on the job about a week, I hope he really knows what he’s talking about. There is a lot at stake here: I’m in the process of qualifying for a lung transplant. My condition is slowly worsening and ANY interruption in services will put me at risk for the rest of my life, bothe pre- and post-operation. There are lots of reasons for being incredulous, especially since my sources aren’t just the media. We’re forced to ride this rollercoaster to the end and I really pray that everything works out well.\nAnd we all pray with ya brother at arms.\nThere is very little chance that your hopes will be met by this man. However, there is still plenty of room to resist.\nFor one, you can educate yourself and others on the nature of “probationary” status in federal service. These aren’t necessarily “new” employees, and these cuts are NOT targeted to any reasonable notion of “efficiency” or “improved care”.\nYou can also contact Congressional representatives, or even attend a protest (health permitting). Let’s not throw in the towel just yet.\nI would like to know if you are a veteran ?\nIn theory that all sounds great. But based on what is currently happening across the Federal government, I have major concerns.\nHere at the Milwaukee VA, programs are already being abolished without replacements and veterans with PTSD are getting LESS care. The art programs here that have helped a lot of veterans are being closed and deemed as unnecessary. It is very important for vets with PTSD to have more than talk and group therapy, we need to truly connect with our emotions and art, music, and recreational therapy does that and connects us with other veterans and the community. Changes that are taking away programs that veterans care about is actively happening.\nI don’t believe any trump appointee.\nNeither do I,\nI can only hope the words you say are true but I don’t trust any of you MAGA radicals, show me! The trend on the right is to put down true patriots and cut everything so the rich can have everything, stripping away things that benefit the rest of us. We are all for trimming excess and have our taxes spent wisely but the problem is in determining what is essential and not, and how it is done!\nWhat is this about cutting VA benefit payments. We laid down our lives for this Country, what more can we do. I’m 76 years old and cannot work anymore, I have service related problems that prevent me from sitting or standing for longer than about 20 to 30 minutes at a time.\nDelta Echo India – hire: Collins\nDonald subservient.\nExpendable.\nIncompetent.\nThere is too much hatred on this website. You folks if you have a real problem at your VA, then immediately ask for a patient advocacy to help you with your situation.\nIn his first term it was clearly documented Trump lied or made stuff up on the order of 30,000 times. Now his co-president seems to spout stuff clearly not true. You do their bidding. How can I possibly believe anything you say? This whole government just makes stuff up.\nMore than 55 years ago when I was in the Navy we had a verb, a transitive verb I should add, that meant to discard without thought and depending on context to discard with contempt. It was to shitcan. Neither of our co-presidents served or have a clue about what it means to serve and the one who would be king avoided service and has clearly demonstrated contempt for those of us who. When it is expedient or useful I fully expect you and they will shitcan us without hesitation. I will enter all my information below so you can target me for shitcanning.\nObama didn’t serve – he said that he thought about it, but it wasn’t for him. Kamala didn’t serve – she said nothing at all about it. So, I only hear people slamming President Trump because he wasn’t in the military. Biden et al and Kamala lied much more than 30,000 times – probably 300,000 times – as everything either said was a lie or some kind of unintelligible statement that made no sense at all. The Biden admin broke laws constantly because they felt that the Constitution and Bill of Rights have no placed in the government of America. All they wanted was to make sure the com mie doctrine was in place everywhere they could get it. During Trump’s first term, promises made/ promises kept. He has made this his pledge again. DOGE is making public all of their findings – transparency is taking place every day. Trump has done more in 1 month than Biden et al did in 4 years and all of it is good for the average person – DOGE is showing where all of our tax money is being spent – it sure isn’t being spent here in America. The list of items is unbelievable – there are many people in Congress who are getting kickbacks of money to add to their coffers, millions of $$$. Trump wants the budget balanced, just as in any business. It will happen under his administration. Promises made/ promises kept. The promise list is getting checked off quickly.\nGetting appt. Less than60 days\nJust because DOGE finds an item due to noticeable $Dollar signs does not mean the entire item needs to be scrapped. The slash and burn attitude of DOGE is reckless and irresponsible thereby not good for the Vets and their families. DOGE is having a negative effect on our population.\nSadky I agree with everything you write.\nUP to this timrI have always received excellent care from the VA.\nWhy sadly? Like you the va has only done well by me since the day i returned from nam. Kudos and thanks to the va. I will however say that since 1971 the va has gotten better as time went forward\nDOGE is only having a negative effect on the population who didn’t vote for Trump. He won the popular and electoral college vote. DOGE is NOT being irresponsible and they are not harming any veterans or their families. My husband and son are disabled veterans. During the Biden admin, my husband couldn’t get in to see his primary care doctor for over 2 years. His appointment was canceled every time. Now that Trump has taken over, my husband has seen his primary care physician twice and he will have a cardiac appointment for the first time in 3 years – all of those appts were also canceled. So, things are looking up for our family with President Trump at the helm. The last VA secretary, Denis McDonough, gave the money that was allotted to the VA for the veterans, to Mayorkas in order that he would have more money for the illegal aliens. Our social security money has also been going to illegals and they have been given free health care – Medicare and Medicaid – which American’s have to pay for – even Medicare. So, I think you better read something other than what you’ve been reading or watching on the news. You’re badly mistaken about Trump – he love his country and will do everything in his power to make America a wonderful place to live, again.\nThank you very much sir. We all know the news media likes to put out false information to confuse the Veteran’s who haven’t any way to see the real info put out by the VA unless they go to the VA for an appointment. My son works for you all and he was worried and I told that his job was safe.\nDEI hire.\nDonald subservient.\nExpendable.\nIncompetent.\nI have read some impending doom remarks. I am appalled by some of the things being stated. Those of you waiting on your money, that’s not new, that’s the military units not knowing what needs to be done. Paperwork for retirement must be done 6 months out from your MDR. Disability claims take time with processing. I’ve been through it and if you don’t get the right physician and the verbiage isn’t correct it takes longer for them to adjudicate your case. All this again is based on the assigned people with individual cases. Remember you are not the only person applying for both retirement or disability. Since it’s only been one month as of today, please be patient with changes that are yet to come. The VA didn’t get this way overnight, so Secretary Collins is working hard to correct the negligence from years of not caring about the veterans. Keep positive and keep pushing for Veterans Rights.\nI agree. Been waiting 18 years but can still walk, talk and have all limbs. I can wait a little while longer. Cervical and Lumbar spinal replacement. Let those with better reasons to go first.\nAgree Peggy. I am a disabled veteran who fought the VA and won. My case was a lot of work on my part, the VA will not help and no one knows my case better than I do, so I treated it like a job . President Trump runs his mouth a lot so is misquoted a lot, that’s just who he is. He is NOT a politician, thank God for that. He has never disrespected us, and he will cut disability to veterans. DOGE has nothing to gain by looking into individual medial claims, that is not its mission. BUT to look into the VA itself, oh yes lots of DI there. Go to the main hospital and see groups of 2 or3 employees standing around chatting with each other. Obama did that–“created” jobs by splitting the job of one making it two.\nNo. While it’s true that this is a poor choice of forum for benefits issues, it’s not entirely irrelvant here. We already suffer obscene wait times and disturbingly careless denials of claims. “Probationary” does not mean “new employee”. It also includes anyone who recently received a merit promotion.\nThere’s no patience to give here, and asking it is harmful and insulting. These acts are not the march of positive progress. If the VA was actually overstaffed, that argument might have some play. But there’s simply no sense in which that is true. They are directly attacking on our benefits, in an underhanded and possibly illegal way.\nThere’s no honor or decency in the behavior of Trump or his loyal sycophants. Please stop spreading disinformation.\nI also was in Vietnam from January 1968 to February 1969. I was also exposed to Agent Orange. When I returned, the only help was to get a house or a loan to go to school. There was no medical help. I had a host of problems and didn’t know what to do, so I became a heavy drinker. Luckily I married a woman who refused to give up on me.\nMr. Collins, I’m copying a fellow vet’s comment. Heartfelt.(You know I do not know why I even wrote a comment. NO BODY reads these anyway. Videos and mailings are just lip service !!!!! They honestly think veterans are just too stupid to know any better. It is so aggravating dealing with the VA. It always has been)\nSincerely Vincent A.Velasquez\nMr Secretary Collins\nThank you for standing up for our Veterans. I believe with your expertise and willingness to do the right thing will allow our Veterans a sense of honor and dignity. I would be willing to help in anyway I can here in Arkansas. I feel with my 35 years of military expertise\nI can be of assistance in the VA system. Thank you for your time. Respectfully,\nMAJ Penny Smith (Retired)\nWhat expertise would that be? He has no medical training.\nThank you for your service, I think some people here are just mad because they lost the election. Give the man a chance, then comment. Lashing out without merit is just petty.\nThis is Bull S—T, our VA System is loaded with too many top level managers, out dated web site, not easy to navigate and slow in following up on care. I’m 86 , 87 this and it appears to me ., that gthey drag my needs out and make me do cartwheels and the deny, it appears that they can’t wait till I expire ? so they don’t have to deal with me. Our commander in chief just froze VA workings and when you go in the Drs Nurses and workers are not smiling any more. NUFF said, Anchors Away, Hooraa, Semoer Fi.\ni do not know how any veteran could vote for this coward. my family has a total of 68 years in the army. we are not suckers or losers.\nPlease do not take the President’s comments out of context. If you are going to post a snippet, then post the whole conversation. Otherwise, you open yourself up to a defamation and slander lawsuit. Our family goes back to Revolutionary War days. Take care my friend, thanks for your service, and have a Great weekend.\nIn context, he called service members suckers and losers and he has denigrated US on more than one occasion. Furthermore, his disgraceful actions have led to friction between our allies and the USA, caused the deaths of countless members of both the military and special agents out in the field, and has sowed hate and distrust within our own population, all while kowtowing to the most oppressive regimes on the planet.\nAnd lets not even start with what happened on January 6th, 2021, when he called on his supporters to attack the capitol in one of the most brazen insurrections in US history, while allowing for his own vice-president to face the gallows.\nThis man is not fit to be the president of the United States, is an active participant in the destruction of our government, and a puppet for foreign powers that enjoy seeing the chaos Trump is sowing in the USA.\nHe isn’t taking it out of context, friend. When a man says “I don’t respect you veterans,” believe him.\nMy family was of the original Virginia planters, and no one has ever reneged on their military duty. Your “boyfriend” has received SIX deferments (heel spurs) for service in Vietnam, yet his orange ass is all over golf courses! And, remember how the CRETIN refused to honor our WWI vets during the 100th anniversary while in France because “it” didn’t want to get “its” hair wet in the rain! Here’s your threat to the previous post, you SNITCH! (Please do not take the President’s comments out of context. If you are going to post a snippet, then post the whole conversation Otherwise, you open yourself up to a defamation and slander lawsuit). Put my name on your list, you coward! You’re thinking like the Clown in your making threats to fellow veterans. Remember who always had your back!\nSo why not post the context then, if that’s your sticking point? Maybe because it doesn’t make it any better?\n“In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as “suckers” for getting killed.”\nLove the gaslighting you done.\nyou are lying , Trump never said that….. it was even never proven, quit spitting out lies\nThen you better tab Obama and Kamala cowards also. Obama didn’t serve – he said he thought about it, but it wasn’t for him. Kamala – she didn’t have anything to say about serving in the military one way or the other. Walz – he lied about what he did in the military along with some other candidates who also lied about even being in the military. So, if you have nothing to say about the above people not serving, then don’t say anything about Trump not serving. Also, you have taken what he said out of context, like all good little com mies and the legacy media. All of you are NOT supporters of our President, you apparently voted for the opposition.\nThis is awesome news. Finally, sense making in the government. Slash waste, fraud and abuse, and focus the money on where it does the most good. As for Elon Musk and DOGE, if the paid for political hacks in the Washington swamp and career bureaucrats can’t stand getting an audit…that should tell you something.\nThere are three parts of Government. Executive, Judicial, and Legislative. The Executive branch is headed by the President as such he has the authority to open anything to anyone he wishes. This is the way any large business is run. To be effective he must delegate duties since he can’t do it alone. I have received a number of letters in the last few years about data breach’s regarding my personal information, so I am afraid my secrets are already out there to a lot less honest people then those working for DOGE. Do I agree with all the things going on in Washington? No, but I am sure that no matter the person running the place in the last few years the Executive has be run by various people in a fashion that has been shameful and needs an adjustment. Unfortunately going after new hires is the only way to do this until a system is established to weed out the deadwood in some of the offices.\nTime will tell but given President Trump’s well documented history of mockery and distain for America’s veterans coupled with his near total disregard for the qualifications, political courage, or character, of his appointees, it is difficult for this veteran to remain optimistic about the future of VA healthcare.\nWell said.\nSo, here is the thing, you survive the President….that is how it has been for the last 30 some years…we’ve never been given a good choice…so you survive the roller coaster ride, I am hoping that we will come out better on the other side. But, I will tell you that no matter what happens, the VA (and all of us veterans) will still be here. I mean, hello, how much have you overcome since getting out of the military? I was in during the Cold War era, and even as a female I was treated horrible by civilians (so that is my vote for NO PRIVATIZATION)…the civilian world is full of a bunch of greedy a-holes that we have to deal with on a daily basis, so if we need to cinch our belt for 4 years, figure it out. You were not given the tools you got while you were in the military service to wallow around like a civilian, so honey’s SUCK IT UP BUTTERCUP. WE WILL SURVIVE, we did not learn the skills we learned while we were in to just turn into a big baby….we ARE survivors and we WILL survive whatever this presidency throws at us…\nAnd not for anything, but I agree with what they are doing, not HOW they are doing it, should have started with a FULL AUDIT….but, the waste in our government (wouldn’t you like to be able to give yourself a raise??) is out of control. I do hope that the country continues to back its veterans, because FREEDOM is NEVER FREE. It is paid for by those of us who choose to raise their hands in defense of our country & Constitution (not the government). So, stay true to yourself and don’t just go with the flow. Find what you need to do to keep your future bright, because it is UP TO YOU…I am scared of what will happen, I only have the VA for medical, but I will survive no matter what happens, because I survived being Active Duty! If you survived Active Duty, you can totally survive THIS!!\nI trust Musk and Trump to do for us what Biden only lied about.\nTrump promised to abandon our allies and take away American freedoms. You voted for that.\nI have been a Republican all my voting life, all the way back to the Young Republicans for Nixon’s 2nd election.\nHowever, I will not vote republican as long as Trump and his lackeys are selling our country.\nI can’t believe you and others are allowing this to happen.\nYou had two chances to stop it the first time around and did not! I did not realize it at that time either, but that is no excuse for what is happening now. He is killing people, don’t you see that?\nPlease show me I can vote GOP again. So, STOP LYING, and empowering liars. You’re handing our country over to, well I don’t even know what to call them.\nPlease wake up and stop him!\nWhen will you honor your pledge,,,,\n“against all enemies, foreign and domestic”\nYou are full of S–t\nVeteran’s medical records & personal information privacy was not addressed.\nWould like a straight answer.\nIs DOGE having access t this information??\nHe just addressed it and stated they do not have any interest in our info, they want to make sure that any contracts that are in place to service us veterans, that money is actually spent on us. Please stop listening to people who haven’t a clue or just spreading misinformation. By the way the SSA and IRS have people in the same capacity as DOGE and they look at your information. Do you trust them not to divulge your information. Just relax.\nI trust them more than I trust a bunch of tech-bros and a billionaire with hundreds of billions of dollars in potential government contracts to decide how our taxes are spent. Musk wants SpaceX and Tesla embedded in government spending so he can get richer. He doesn’t care about you, and Trump will go along with everything he says. I can’t understand why people like you continue to ignore the blatantly obvious conflicts of interest this administration continues to inflict on our country. Did you buy Trump stock, or his rug pull meme coin too? How many times must you be scammed before you wake up?\nMy friends work for VA and are veterans, their data was breached by DOGE!\nThank you for your input on our concerns over our benefits that might be cut!?….\nSincerely,\nMrs. James R Cales\nThey will not be cut!\nOf course they will! It’s in Project 2025, and so far they have been following to a T. People said it was not the president’s agenda, yet everything being done right now is straight out of the Heritage Foundation agenda. The budget proposes to stop any funding of Medicaid. Any vet in an elderly home or on long term disability depends on Medicaid to cover costs of healthcare. Vets in memory care will be left forced out of their homes.\nGood initial message. Let me know if I can help.\nI can’t believe what little faith you have in president Trump and musk after what you had under Obama and Biden. Neither one loved our military and Doug Collins is a good guy. I’ve watched him for a while now and like him a lot. It’s been a month give them a chance. The other two presidents have tired to ruin our country. I know it’s a long process and it’s hard when you’re hurting. My husband was 25 years navy and never wanted to put in for his VA” he said others needed it more. But we finally got him to realize how many problems he has. We’ll see what happens. I love America and president Trump.\nFirstly, I’d like to thank all my fellow veterans for their service !!\nIf you don’t believe that there is fraud, waste, and abuse of your tax dollars then you are absolutely right not to support Trump and his designated representatives in DOGE. You can join in with the politicians who are fighting against the audits of organizations like USAID, but unlike those politicians, you won’t be making any money off of it. The entire process is going to take time and will require some sacrifice, but the ultimate goal is to improve the economy, shrink the deficit, and put more money back in the hands of the taxpayers instead of other countries and economies. Refusing to believe the promises made by the president are somewhat illogical as he has most definitely worked to keep so many promises that he made during his campaign in the past 30 days.\nIn the end it’s all up to you and, of course, this is only my humble opinion, but I choose to believe that the purpose of the cost cutting and auditing of our government offices will eventually help us all to be stronger financially and fiscally.\nI would never see a fellow veteran hurt, and do not believe that in the long run we will be. If you disagree then is your responsibility to get in contact with your elected representative and make your concerns known. If you do not do this writing something here will not help you at all. Let your voice be heard where it will help.\nWe are strong and we are many !!\nI’m the wife of a highly decorated US INFANTRY Corporal. we’re in our fifties. My MOM has TDS. I am a 3xTrump voter& hubby voted Trump/Vance in 2024 after YEARS of political apathy …WHY is my Mom(&many others) he’ll bent on saying that Trump will cut Veterans’ benefits/cut seniors’ medicare etc etc…\nI’m honestly confused. I live in “stoopid liberal Colorado(Yea gangs of Illegals!)” It really seemed as though things were better 2016-2020…\nPatience is a virtue. It took four years of tyranny to completely destroy the US economy and security, it will not be fixed in a month. I wish all would look at the way it was in 2016-2020, he did his best with a democratic/Socialistic Senate and House. He knows what needs to be done, and now he has the citizen, senate and house republicans majority backing him. Just got a few bad weeds to pluck to get the garden producing real produce.\nAll I know is my 87 year old father’s VA funded homemaker services are ending this week. The VA did not call him or notify him of this. They notified the health care company that they would no longer be paying for services as he no longer qualified. Nothing about his condition has recently changed. His housekeeper stated that about 10 of her client’s home care services were cut this week. She states she will need to look for another job. When the VA cuts benefits it effects many different people. My father is not able to care for himself. I will need to do more for him now. This will make it more difficult for me to work. Everything has gone up in price and I am no longer able to afford groceries most weeks. Now I will not be able to take extra hours at work. I am poor now and it appears things are only going to get worse for the working poor as prices on everything continue to increase. I don’t believe what this man is saying because I read the recommended report that called for drastic cuts to the VA. I also know that Trump has made very rude comments towards Veterans on more than a few occasions. He has never shown any respect for Veterans, and I doubt that will change. I am sad for our country today and just hope that the US does not abandon it’s Veterans. God save the USA\nHi, Melissa. We’re sorry to hear about your father’s experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nWill the Manila VA get upgrades . Not only are there older vets here\nThere is a growing community of DS,OIF,andOEF vets coming to the Philippines. Plus many at the VAhere wish they could offer more services (non-admin)\nMr. Secretary could you please look into what I am about to tell you please sir. The VA is making veterans like me that got separation pay pay it back by taking our disability checks away from us to pay back the separation pay. This separation pay was given to me almost 30 years ago and they are taking my disability check away from me that I need and I know a lot of veterans had this happen to them also. This isn’t right. As a veteran we shouldn’t have to pay back any separation pay. That pay helped me transition from military life to civilian life. Veterans like me depend on our disability check to help us each month. Please look into this and please get this stopped not just for me but to all the veterans, Thank You\nA VA debt waiver is a decision to forgive or cancel a debt owed to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). You can request a waiver if you can demonstrate financial hardship or that repayment would be unfair.\nTo request a waiver:\nComplete and sign VA Form 5655, the Financial Status Report\nWrite a letter on a separate sheet of paper explaining why you should be granted a waiver\nInclude supporting documentation, such as proof of income, assets, and expenses\nSpecify “Waiver” in Block “3” of the Financial Status Report\nInclude your file number and name on each page of documentation\nWhen to request a waiver\nYou have one year from the date you received your first debt letter or copay bill to request a waiver.\nFactors that may help your case: Low income, High essential expenses, Unexpected financial burdens, Inability to pay, and VA errors or misinformation.\nAdditional information\nYou can call the VA Debt Management Center at (800) 827-0648 for questions about benefit overpayments.\nI’m concerned about African national has access to my information not only on VA.gov. but also social security. I request that my name and info be removed from what ever info he has.\nIf you ever used PayPal he has it already.\nIt seems to me that you have never been independent and always pushed right wing policies. Will that change in your new position?\nwhat absolute bullshit. Trump Doesn’t Give a Damn about Vets and Musk’s Team of Juvenile hackers are attacking agencies that were investigating Musk. Paying Vet’s their Benefits or providing healthcare Doesn’t Profit the Billionaires one bit, and so will fall under the category of ” wasteful spending”. Trump has already Violated the Constitution averaging about Once per day since he Entered office, why would he stop at those of us sworn to uphold and defend it?\nOh! It seemed as though doge is a good things. I certainly do NOT want one more illegal alien crossing the border. Poor Jocelyn Nungarye, Laken Riley and too many others DEAD at the hands of illegal criminal aliens. We’re home owners, live less than 5miles north of EDGE OF LOWRY….THIS CRAP must end…our children deserve much better\nThey’re not doing a single thing for the American people, except taking our money. The president should care about ALL of the people. Not just some. He refused to send disaster relief to CA because we have a democratic governor. He has sent not one cent. That’s disgusting, and I’m sick of it!\nI would assume that you know for certain that DOGE is doing good things as you call it? Although I am in no way advocating illegal crossing into the US, those “Aliens” as both the president and you call them are human just like you…oh wait, their not from here so that would make them aliens…I see now! Do better\nHow can you sit there and blatantly lie. We were at our VA today half of the staff are gone. No one to help take him to the 3rd floor . You are a disgrace . You do not support the veterans only yourself and orange.\nShort and to the point – Well Done. Looking forward to the ramp-up of even better VA Healthcare. Best wishes to you and your team.\nWell done President Trump appointing Doug as our Secretary. I have nothing but the highest praise for our all three departments of the VA. Specifically, the VA Health and the VA Benefits Administrations. Excellent health care since retiring in 1991.\nDoug, you know where the Left and Democrats get their information. It’s truly sad when veterans feel disenfranchised. I’ve always recommended fellow Vets visit one of the well-qualified Veteran Service Officers (VSO’s) at the various veteran organizations. I am a Life member of both the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) and the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). America has great veteran organizations that provide support and guidance. BZ to you and your team.\nThis is a weak scripted response, as a Nam era veteran having served this country it is a disgrace what Trump and Musk and his bunch of cronies are doing to our country and hard working Federal Workers. Actions speak louder than words Mr Collins.\nMy uncles BOTH served Viet Nam in the Marines. I am still not convinced that “Let’s Go Brandon” would’ve been better for our Vets&Seniors’…. MY HUBBY is a Ver(US INFANTRY CORPORAL 1988-91\nMy husband is a disabled veteran and receives very good care at the VA. With that being said I know that there is much wasteful spending within our government. I wish President Trump would drain the swamp and not go after the Department of Veterans Affairs employees who only make 60,000 a year.. go after the big guys who are cheating the system. Why are so many people in Congress millionaires?\nThat’s not what DOGE said they have laid off 1000 employees though it’s not a large amount we have been having trouble with appointment’s and reliable transportation to and from appointment’s. So I guess I’ll just have to wait and see if things get any better which I seriously doubt.\nEver run this past the attorneys, Doug. Is this use of government resources for politicking? Does this violate the Hatch act? Just askin’, ole buddy.\nI’m a disabled Army veteran of 32 years, and a bi-lateral amputee. I’m still waiting on my SMC case to be heard, and I definitely can’t afford to lose what I do receive from the VA now. Trump should be hands off on a lot of things, and the VA should be one, as well as the Pentagon.\nUgggghhh. …so SORRY to read your comments… hopefully Trump will acquiesce(sp?)/be hands-off. He certainly has many other great achievements/100x’s better than “let’s GO Brandon” as a President.\nHe has only achieved in destroying our democratic govt. It’s gonna take decades to pay off all of the lawsuits due to the illegal acts of Trump and Musk. You just can’t fire govt employees, especially those who have employment contracts, just because you want to.\nSubmit a congressional inquiry to your state’s congressman. This expedites your claim. If i remember correctly, from the time congress sends your inquiry over, the va has 72 hours to respond? I used to work in claims department and I myself have personally submitted a congressional inquiry and it did get addressed right away. *stuff they don’t tell you*\nThank you Sir.\nUnder no circumstance do my husband who is a US military veteran and myself support Trump and allowing Musk an unelected private civilian have access to any federal agency or make changes that can impact our well-being negatively. You, the VA, have the responsibility of protecting veterans their families and dependents from losing or reducing their monetary, health and mental healthcare, and other benefits. As it is the VA system is very dysfunctional and nearly impossible to navigate through, making unlawful and careless changes to the system makes it more difficult to almost impossible for veterans to access such a vital component for their well-being, especially the elderly, mentally incapacitated, and those with brain injuries sustained while serving to protect this nation.\n?? Veterans Deserve Better – Why Is the VA Ignoring Its Own Laws on Missing Service Records?\nThe VA is failing thousands of veterans by ignoring its own regulations regarding missing service treatment records! 38 CFR §§ 3.303, 3.304, and 3.307 require the VA to accept secondary evidence (lay statements, medical opinions, post-service treatment records) when service records are lost or destroyed. Yet, veterans are being denied benefits because of the VA’s own recordkeeping failures.\nThe VA Secretary has no power to say there will be no cuts. The Elon/Trump dictatorship will cut whatever they want, without regard for anything except their own pocketbooks. They will cut our benefits long all while adding to Elon’s billion $ government contracts. Don’t pretend like anyone in this administration is there to do anything other than make money for themselves.\nI got ripped off by the VA for 8500plus. All I got was a run around,not even a disabled tag for my truck.\nI am retired DoD employee, and a Vietnam Veteran that is 100% TDIU and I find it very hard to swallow that we have DOGE who is going around pulling people from jobs. The people that they’re targeting are those who are on Probation, and the government hire these people because of the downsize that they have had over the years. A person have to remember that when a person retire, they need to train another person for that job, and in most cases they’re hiring two for the one person, because of all the work a excuse my words (an old timer use to do). I know as a retiree I filled the work for two or three personnel at time, and now a new person have to come on board an learn the work by themselves without the aide of an old timer. Yes, a lot of stuff has gone internet or through google, but there’s lots to be said about book knowledge and not just Google knowledge. I hate the fact this administration is firing people without knowing the work that is being performed. As far as the Secretary saying what he’s saying, I to will hold you to your words. After all Congress passed a lot of others to their word, and now they’re going around chopping people from their jobs, just be of trump says so or this person name musk. The word must to mean only a bad odor, and this guy is a bad odor waiting to happen. You may not like my words and I don’t care, I’m a veteran and retired federal employee who did his country proud, and I’m honor to have served both. Now, treat your veterans right and hopefully in the future the Veteran Organizations that support the clowns we put in office, will keep their mouth shut and not support any politician and see if they can elected on their TRUE words. If anyone comes after my ss, accounts or any of family information, lookout.\nThis dude must think we’re all stupid. The mere fact that he used this snippet to attack the media tells you everything you need to know about him. Donnie D*mb *ss doesn’t give a damn about veterans. We’re props when he needs us for a photo op and we’re disposable when he doesn’t. Never forget these words spoken by Donnie….\nOn disabled veterans\n“Why do you bring people like that here? No one wants to see that, the wounded.” September 30, 2019.\n“Look, I don’t want any wounded guys in the parade. This doesn’t look good for me.” Summer 2017.\nOn US military officials\n“I don’t want to tell you what I had to go through with these people.

You and this administration disgust me\nI don’t believe one word of it, he’s a politician, he’s a maga clown for trump and trump hates disabled veterans, not trustworthy at all!\nSecretary Collins,\nI am concerned about my grandson; he is a disabled 101st Airborne Division veteran who was awarded the Purple Heart for injuries sustained in combat in Afghanistan. In addition to the combat injuries, he is now being treated for leukemia which was most likely caused by exposure to toxins and other hazards in Afghanistan. Based on the PACT Act, he applied for a higher VA disability rating due to toxic exposure, but he has not yet received a response to his applications for over six months. Could you please expedite this slow process.\nLeukemia is a high priority claim. Those are USUALLY expedited. I’d get in touch with your vso or submit a congressional inquiry.\nI was denied benefits for secondary ed because of my advance prostate cancer. informed the va that, I tried penis pump, pills penis ejects still waiting to here back from them\nThanks to everyone for their concerns. This a little off from what you explained; but, I am a Vietnam Vet, came home,\nworked in private industry for a number of years; was college educated/with my blessed GI Bill Coverage: then\nbecame an appraiser with my Local County Government after 31 years, then was told my years of service with the\ngovernment would conflict with the amount of money I was entitled too under SS would go down if I wouldn’t retire from\nCounty Work. Hey, I felt it was time to retire because I was treated fairly. So, here’s my question; Will the government\nallow the full amount of SS allotted to those, like myself, the framed amount over the time we spent in Private Industry work without losing that money, for working under the States PERS scheduled money allotted? Thanks\nfor your reply. Mr. Keenan PS. Word has it that President Trump is going to pass it thru to follow the new guidelines of Social Security Monies and Government Work Monies. Thank you very much for your reply\nI don’t believe that Trump really cares about our Veterans we need to spend a lot of money to take care of them which is exactly what we need to do ? problems though are that doesn’t help the 1%\nI certainly do not and will not trust any sort of message from The Traitor’s Cabinet. DJT, the draft dogger, called veterans like us “loosers and suckers” and naturally will not stop President Musk from destroying the VA. The VA is extremely understaffed yet 1000 employees from the Crisis Line were summarily fired. Action must be taken to restore democracy in the US starting with Congress stopping the illegal actions by DOGE and the DOJ arresting Musk for his violations of US Law including his fraudulently obtaining US citizenship.\nI cant trust President Trump or Elon Musk to speak the truth when they don’t seem to care about the Ukrainian nation and more about what pleases Putin !!!\nHere here, trumpy has lost his mind.\nHe’s not interested in Ukraine because he has no financial interests there like he has in Russia. And I guess post WWII, the Iron Curtain, and spread of communizism have been conveniently forgotten. Let’s see, Ukraine is a sovereign nation. Crimea was part of it until Puti stole it in 2014. You don’t annex by force or coercion. Puti didn’t stop with Crimea…. will he stop at Berlin this time. Trump makes America great again after he makes Trump interests great again. Putin’s puppet.\nI’m pulling into your way as secretary of the veteran administration. I’ve been trying to get my disability for the last 56 years. Haven’t got anything. All I get is deny deny deny.\nI’m holding you to your word I pray for my benefits. My disability benefits over 34 years ago hadn’t received anything. They keep denying me.\nThey are going to make it even hard to get service connected if you are not already….\nNO MATTER HOW IT IS LOOKED AT, THAT NARCCISSIST/ILL-MINDED SO CALLED DICTATOR THAT YOU SEEM TO LOVE SO MUCH, WILL STILL SCREW ALL IF NOT MOST OF US “VETERANS”, IN THE LONG RUN OF HIS AUTHORITARIAN REGIME. HIM DISMANTLING THE FEDERAL GOV’T IS DOING US MORE HARM THAN GOOD. TAKE YOUR BLINDERS OFF AND UNPLUG YOUR EARS AND “LISTEN”, TO WHAT HE IS SAYING TO ALL. HE IS CREATING HAVOC WITHIN THE USA AND ABROAD. SO DO NOT PREACH HE IS DOING GOOD, HE ISN’T. HE WANTS NOTHING MORE THAN TO BE A FRIG’N DICKTATOR. HE IN THE PAST ALREADY PUT DOWN ALL DECEASED “VETERANS”, HE WAS OVERSEAS DURING HIS FIRST TERM IN THE PEOPLES’ WHITEHOUSE. IF YOU ARE NOT DISGUSTED BY THAT, THEN YOU ARE WORTHY OF THE POST YOUR IN!!!!!\nI hope things get better with clearing cases. I’ve been waiting since July 2024 just to add my dependent and there’s not been a single update to it on the web site since it was submitted. I’ve called several times to inquire about it, all they can tell me when I call is that’s it’s “pending.” Secondly, it took nearly a year for my disability claim to be processed and came back with only a partial rating. I’ve resubmitted additional information, it that going to take another year to get feedback on? Finally, I’ve been trying to get a community care referral for a procedure that is authorized by the VA, and if authorized for one Veteran, it should be available for every veteran. However, getting this referral is proving to be very difficult with multiple hoops to jump through and the providers at the VA hospital not being very helpful or being cynical at best.\nI just find it disappointing that illegal aliens, those on welfare or receiving other benefits seem to get signed up and receiving these benefits with little to no effort while Veterans have to run a gauntlet of numerous obstacles to “maybe’ get the benefit they have earned.\nI wish Secretary Collins much success in his new role and I’m hopeful he can make the highly needed improvements. Hey, how about reassigning those 87,000 positions authorized for the IRS to the VA instead?\nI do not trust Doug Collins nor any other Trump appointee. Elon Musk, an unelected billionaire, is taking a meat axe to our Federal Government, firing people with institutional knowledge and civil service protections, while Trump shreds the Constitution and the Rule of Law. We will be lucky to come out of these next years with our democracy intact. Quacks and incompetents are being installed to head cabinet positions. Real people are hurting as a result of Trump and Musk’s actions. More cuts are in the offing and no program is safe.\nTime will Tell !\nGlad to hear benefits earned will continue. Perhaps vets can finally receive the federal mileage reimbursement for medical appointments vs the .41 cents per mile and a deduction of $3 each way. Fifteen years ago, homecare nurses here got $.58 per mile. Wonder what VA employees get for their qualified mileage reimbursement.\nOoooorah! You said it, now stand by what you’ve said and do it! Semper Fi!\nI see when he was asked about DOGE getting access to Veterans personal information how he really didn’t answer that question just like the rest of them avoid answering a simple question.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins, you need to resign effective immediately and should be banned from any position within the VA or any Federal position.\nThank you for your comment.\nThank you Secretary Collins! I am looking forward to your leadership with this Department. I really appreciate your transparency and your energy! As we say in the Navy….BRAVO ZULU!\nFiring thousands of employees… but healthcare won’t be affected? How dumb does he think we are? Has anyone else been at the VA and heard anyone talk about being over staffed?\nTypical trump boot licker trying to save face while he plans to stab us in the back later\nI’m a 77-year-old veteran (1968-1975, Honorable Discharge). I just watched the President of the United States with his [virtual] arm around Vladimir Putin, announcing to the world that Ukraine started the war that has devasted their homeland and killed thousands, followed by a rebuke by Vice President Vance of members of the European Union who had the audacity to suppress AfD’s assault on a demoratic society, and a clear move to abandon allies of 80 years for a war criminal. So perhaps you can excuse me for being skeptical of anything coming from this Administration. The G.I. Bill gave me a career after service, for which I am extremely grateful. It is devastating to see what has become of a once-proud nation.\nThank you for your service. I wish you well\nAction has a Reaction. Ukraine did start the war and Putin said “OK, let’s go”, and moved Armored vehicles into position. Biden got USA involved with dollars and the game was afoot.\nWatch your back veterans! He sounds like a Trump suck up. Remember that Trump dodged the Viet Nam war and has no respect for veterans!\nTrump did not dodge the VN conflict. Bone spurs are identified by X-RAY not by a letter from daddy who was a land developer not a government official with pull. Clinton dodged the war by fleeing the country.\nThere is a special place in hell for you and the others that bend the knee and kiss ring. Sacrificing veteran care to line your pockets. Utterly shameful. You are a disgrace and I hope both sides of your pillow are hot in hell.\nFull cowardice on display. They break us in their wars and then get upset when it costs money to keep us healthy. DOGE and trump will cripple the VA. Firing thousands of “probationary” employees to save a buck in the name of “efficiency”… what a disappointment and disgrace.\nI was out drinking… I just woke up… what’s going on? aslo… how did you get my email?\nMr. Secretary,\nI was not deceived by the rumor reports but appreciate you prompt reassurance.\nAlso I regret that the VA is subject to such false reporting.\nI don’t understand what ‘website’ is required to leave a simple comment,\nThank you for the straight dope on the situation. Much appreciated.\nThank you for your service to America’s Veterans !! Please keep up the Great Work !!\nVery disappointing message delivery and content. Hypocritical and disingenuous when thousands of VA employees have been axed by an administration that is doing immediate and lasting damage across all Federal agencies. As happened with the Bureau of Land Management 6 yrs ago, there is no concern for the impact, only moving in a manner that eliminates opposition and any effort to reduce costs responsibly.\nMr. Collins, your political invocations show you are as crass and uncaring about Veterans as the angry orange you serve. You do not serve nor honor my 20 years (and 3 family generations) of Navy service.\nPlease inspect the Tuskegee va\nI found Mr. Collins remarks about veteran benefits being cut or threatened as a standard “talking point” that is the answer for any DOGE complaint about acting as a legitimate branch of our government. Congress needs to stop allowing him and his team to have access to any records of any Federal employees. Don’t trust the media but trust Trump, Musk and you? Your actions speak contrary to your message. Will you resign your position if this continues or will you stand up to Trump and Musk?\nMy experience with the VA where I live has been A plus for 35 years. I have watched them deal with staff shortages, uncertainty with funding and now the threat of having their position eliminated without a valid reason. I appreciate everything they have done in the past and worry about how the future will look.\n50 years in the VA healthcare system since 1969 Vietnam I am in Shock and want to Scream\nMike R, that is straight left-wing conspiratorial fear-mongering garbage. You’ve trusted an incompetent federal government with your personal information your whole life, and didn’t think twice anytime they’ve asked you for your personal information. It’s utterly laughable that you think Trump and Elon are going to take your banking to steal your VA pension.\nI’ve been waiting 3 months for approval…To have a tooth fixed!!! The government has ALL our information already.\nYou either work for them, are 100% leftist, or NEVER had to deal with the VA.\nQuit bellyaching…Most of us want the VA FIXED.\nWalter Cook\nDo you honestly believe there is no waste that can be addressed? They need to go over all the contracts from govt. contractors go bankrupt without finishing a project. Salisbury NC VA. Contractor won a bid for a 3 story parking garage. Stopped at 2 levels because of structural problems. And most of the 2nd story is unusable because of those same problems. The contractor got paid $10 million and declared bankruptcy. The VA needs to stop paying for shoddy construction. And seeing how the democrats are the first ones to call for cutting DD funding. I am more worried about them. The standard talking points I’ve heard over the last40 plus years is everything is good. While waiting weeks or months for appointments. especially to see a specialist. No communication between VA hospitals or clinics. Ask about it being computer generated and was told they don’t talk to each other unless specifically asked. There can be improvement. If I believed the media rhetoric the world under Trump would have ended in 2016.\nSecretary Collins,\nI am going to hold you to this. I am in a 6x month estimated waiting period myself for backpay owed. I, also, 100% support DOGE. It needs to happen, and that much is obvious to me. I read a lot of scathing comments below that make me think there are simply bad actors who aren’t actually a part of this crowd within them, specially the ones that have nothing to do with the VA or your message since it appears that anyone can comment here. I can tell you that it has taken many years to get as far as I’ve gotten with the disability process. It shouldn’t take actual years for this. That’s ridiculous.\nDear Secretary,\nI hope your words are of truth: only time will tell. Please help the displaced federal workers that need help as well.\nRespectfully,\nChief Johnson\nIt won’t be understaffed if you privatize it\nNEVER PRIVATIZE. VA offers the best care. Average wait time in Civilian Hospitals for new patients, 26 days. I never wait that long. The VA offers community care if they can’t see you in a timely manner. Privatized Care will cost taxpayers (you and me) lots more money. The care givers are not specialists in war time injuries. This is a money grab scheme.\nGood idea! But I am 1-Hr+ away from any VA facility anyway.\nWhy not just cut the VA down to just those required to treat and work with serious war injuries and severe PTSD. For the rest of us, make it so we can go to the Dentist, Doctor, etc. without having to wait weeks or months for approval from “Community Care”. I have been waiting over 3 months to get my tooth fixed. THAT is RIDICULOUS!\nBut, yes, privatizing would be better than it is now.\nSincerely,\nWalter Cook\nTrump/ Musk, sounds like brown shirts to me.and all off his picks have drank the cool aid.\nI served three tours in the Nam with the USMC, was wounded twice ,suffered broken bones and am a diabetic from exposure to agent orange. I do not trust you or any of Trump/Musk appointees, none of you are qualified for the jobs you have. I firmly believe despite your statement that if Trump/Musk says slash and burn the VA you will be the first to light the match . I believe that the VA secretary should always be a COMBAT VETERAN!!!!!! How can we trust a president who buddies up with a Russian dictator????????\n100% Agent Orange Killed Us In Vietnam We Just Haven’t Died Yet Sprayed and Betrayed 1967\nI agree with you he sounds like a Trump suck up! Please remember this in the 2026 election when no Republican is standing up to Trump!\nIgnorance. Remember this, no Democrat stood for us. Or cancer kids,gold star moms ECT. Y’all are all about me me me me. Pogs\nTotally agree, he’s going to prove to be another spineless jellyfish making excuses for commander bone spurs, who dodged the draft.\nSince when did he buddy up with a Russian dictator you ate up POS.\nYou did not address the firing of 1,000 probationary employees, many of whom at Vets.\nDoug , STOP! We know from the video you are a Trump Boot Licker\nAnd we also know you’re a liberal. You are using hate and media propaganda instead of common sense. We have a $70 trillion debt. Mostly to China. $5.6 billion a day interest payments. A almost $2 trillion deficit. Now give me any examples of democrat cutting or even slowing of any spending. And I’ll give you one to start. They always throw the Dept of Defense out first for cuts. Guess where the money for the VA comes from. It’s all part of the DOD budget. But the democrats always say they would never cut VA spending. But like many it seems to be a case of don’t touch my govt benefits. Go after someone else. right. There are many Vietnam veterans who voted for the change. I’m one . The country is going broke. The left doesn’t care and spends taxpayer money on their agenda instead of the people who need it most. Homeless Vets and other citizens.\nI don’t believe that it’s only Liberals as you call them that use hate or media propaganda instead of common sense. Yes we do have a huge debt, many people act as if it juts happened in the last 4 years. Government spending has always gone both ways, when one party is in office, the said spending is just right, but the other party is in office they are wasting tax payers money. We have a tendency to make excuses for whoever we voted for so hat we can feel good about our choice…but always remember, common sense is not common to everyone!\nWhen will choice program come back. President Trump said he would privatize the VA, I can hardly wait.\nMe too, John. VA incompetence is stunning.\nThis is embarrassing, you’re just towing the maga republican line blaming the media for your parties inability to lead. You sound like a used care salesman. Your fast talking isn’t fooling anyone but the fools. Keep your politics out of our medical care.\nQuick question, tell how firing people is going to improve the speed of getting an appointment?! Get your head out of this administrations a$$, the military is apolitical and so should be the VA. You’re an embarrassment to the uniform.\nWe have to take to the streets\nFor what. If the democrats would agree to cuts for their pork barrel agendas like sending 50 million to house illegals in hotels in NYC or for DEI programs in other countries. Building a roads to nowhere. Maybe the deficit and $70 trillion in debt would be addressed and our benefits would be better. Instead of attacking the ones trying to fix the mismanagement of the country for the last 50 years.\nWhat about the reduction of disability benefits due to household income thresholds with reductions of disability payments to start at houshold incomes of 125k and a reduction to zero benefit dispursed at 175k. That was voted on and put in place that is supposed to take effect in April of 2025 , but keeps getting pushed out and delayed, please address this.\nTypical Trump dog. No substance with more BS. Agency under staffed but does best it can. Then it gets cut more. Doesn’t look like anyone has any balls. Your just another puppet.\nWhere has it been cut. 1000 probationary people out of 475 thousand. Nationwide. If it’s like the FAA firings it’s janitorial and lawn mowing people. $70 Trillion in debt to China. $3.6 interest on that debt daily. Almost $2 trillion deficit every year. Is that BS. You find running a home or business in that economic state good? Which party always calls for the first cuts to be the DOD? Democrats. And guess what that’s where the VA gets its budget from.\nTrump spent $15 million to attend the Super Bowl. He spent $5 million to take a lap around the racetrack. Numerous times golfing while Americans are crying and unsure of the future. Disgusting. He cares nothing about us.\nI would like to know why the V.A. took the 100% rating from me and put me at 30% by in 1988 . Now the V.A. a few years ago gave me the 100% rating. I was in the Army 1966-1988 . August of 1968 I was in the Army hospital at Fort Polk La. The Army doctor said no more active duty for me. He said I had a bad Heart and could not stay in the Army anymore . So from August 1968 to October 1968 I had no duty . So I sat around for 3 months till they said I could go home with only 30% disability rating . With a bad Heart it was hard to find a job. In August 1981 the V.A. said that they are going to put a artificial heart value . I was rated at 100% 1981. In 1988 V.A. said that I wasn’t sick anymore. They put a valve in so I am OK . So from 100 % back down to 30% . So a few ago 2023 THe V.A. put back to 100% . So my Questions are Why wasn’t given a medical discharge in 1968 . Question 1988 to 2023 why wasn’t I given back pay . I have had a very sad life because of not being able to work .\nTypical VA BS. Over and hour drive for me so I use Community Care, but approvals take forever…But so does sitting at the VA.\nSounds like they should give you a LOT of backpay, but wouldn’t hold my breath. And what’s the deal with all these people in the comments bashing Trump??? He ain’t even been in a month. Not like he can make it much worse?! Bunch of Hanoi Jane wannabes trolling the comments!\nPraying for You and all our Brothers & Sisters dealing with the bureaucracy.\nSincerely,\nWalter Cook\nWas your bad heart the fault of the military..\nI hope all of you that have posted comments or asked questions including me know that the only ones reading these comments/messages/ETC are us and the waste basket, but its interesting to see that many of us have pros and cons on the VA service and the past and present Government. the race of the Turtle and the Hare that the Turtle won bec of caution, determination and a a real consistent approach Once again todays venture Haste makes Waste\nSecretary Collins, I am Henry Dittman, Major, USAF (ret). I just watched your Video Message, re Real Status of VA vs Rumor Mill Vapid, Vacuous B.S. Thanks for the update.. I look forward to seeing you and the NEW Leadership in VA providing support and help for ALL of Veterans.. I have confidence that Pres. Trump wouldn’t have selected you for this position if he didn’t have the UTMOST confidence in your capabilities. Press On, Sir…”Kick the tires and light the fires” and get this Bird in the air!!\nMan have you drank the cool aid!!! This guy is a suck up to Trump who was a draft dodger for Viet Nam! On the plus side the V.A has treated me with respect so I wonder how many of them will be let go?\nIf you look at the rest of the very unqualified people filling cabinet positions, you should understand this one is only marginally better. He’s still a Trump sycophant but if you think that’s okay, so be it. I don’t hold people who openly flout the Constitution in high regard.\nIt’s an insult to think THIS administration has Americas best interest at heart. When his only self-serving whims that DOUG and little donnie care about.\nJust a note. Most of us totally support President Trump’s efforts with DOGE. I for one am very thankful for my local VA and the truly dedicated staff (Topeka, KS).\nI have to believe the new Director of the VA is sincere in his remarks but I have to add my story. I’m 75, I previously applied twice for VA Health Benefits, denied both times. Since the PACT Act I did extensive research to establish and prove my ship did gunfire support in areas of Agent Orange exposure. After 40+ years I was granted VA Health Benefits under what is labeled “Naval Herbicide Service”. I guess no-one wants to say Agent Orange out loud.\nFurther research indicates I have several conditions related to NHS/Agent Orange and I have applied for compensation. That was right at five months ago. I do understand there are probably thousands now applying. Most of my Vietnam era group do not have much time left.\nI received a letter February 17, 2025 dated January 31, 2025 from the Dept. of Veterans Affairs saying they are still processing my application for compensation and apologize for the delay, I would be notified upon completion of processing. No estimation of anticipated date of completion.\nToday I read in the VA Director’s comments ” Veterans Benefits cases are being cleared even faster than ever”.\nDoes that sound like a disconnect to anyone else?\nRome wasn’t built a day, and good things take time. I want to believe the Director’s optimism will come tobe.\nMost of us DO NOT totally support Cap’n Bone Spurs, speak for yourself!\nonly 2 types of veterans exist that don’t support trump. 1 the stolen valor veteran 2. the never seen combat veteran with no pride in their country. put down the kool-aid and your M.A.P magazines.\n“Today I read in the VA Director’s comments ” Veterans Benefits cases are being cleared even faster than ever”.”\nwhat proof do you have of what you are saying or are you just repeating what the trumpers are saying? so much of what has been said as truth turns out to be lies. i pointed out the story in Military.com and for some reason it never showed up here. it is about the firing of over 1000 VA employees.\nI’m sorry it’s been delayed for you. I think the statement about completing faster than ever is because of the recent hiring of claims processors. Especially since the PACT Act, the submissions has increased. Compared to years past, they are moving quicker, slowly chipping away at the backlog in addition to working priority claims (think terminally ill, old Veterans). You can view the current inventory and backlog plus more online. Currently sitting just under 950k.\nUntil recently, processors were working mandatory overtime. Since that is no longer the case, the backlog and claims inventory may go up.\nI hope your claim will be completed soon so you get the benefits you deserve!!\nYou know I do not know why I even wrote a comment. NO BODY reads these anyway. Videos and mailings are just lip service !!!!! They honestly think veterans are just too stupid to know any better. It is so aggravating dealing with the VA. It always has been. The armed forces of America plan and hope everyone gets KIA. It’s cheaper. Much less Veterans to deal with. The only thing is they do need clinics for their budgets. It makes it easier to steal the money. Because it damn sure isn’t going into my bank account. When I see this BS rhetoric. It just pisses me off. I was so ripped off spent 4 years in. Did a good job. I volunteered for extra duty. I went to extra schools so I would be extra qualified so I could volunteer for extra duty. I was passed up for promotions because I am a white man. I entered the Army as an E3 due to four years of JROTC. I GRADUATED Lieutenant Colonel and battalion Commander. I earned drill team Commander for the last three years of high school. We won every drill meet. My Jr. and Senior years to give others schools a chance we went as exhibition only. Because we were so strong and flawless. I and team did not mind. I was even in honor grad in basic training as best drilled individual. I have letters in my file of accommodations. But my skin was too white. When I got to permanent party every single private was promoted to E4. Going through the ranks before me. I entered the Army as an E3 but time in service and time in grade did not mean a damn thing!!! I was even a sponsor for a few of the new E1’s. I was married for 2.5 years before ever joining the Army. Reverse racism really is alive and well. I shook the hands of all of the privates that out ranked me. I was happy for them they did very well and deserved the promotions however I thought I worked as hard if not a little harder due to my volunteering for extra duty. I just wasn’t dark enough. You know you have to keep the numbers in balance. Don’t want too many white men getting a head due to white privileged you know.\nOh Daryl…..so sad you are….and a racist too….white supremacist?\nI read your post. I agree with you. If you’re not black or LGBT or over qualified you get passed over. Black and queer privilege now. I’m praying things change. Thank you for your service. I served in the Navy.\nWow, you actually said that out loud, thank you for being transparent. Many people who have that mindset don’t they just simply smile and deny the most qualified person of color. I am unsure what world you experienced, let me know where this is at where people of color are moving ahead of white men, white women, asian, indian? Please we want to go, quickly!! Minorities always have to have more education, more experience and change our appearance to be considered. Hey all you blacks, listen up there is a place where we are getting put ahead of white men and women WITHOUT EXPERIENCE and EDUCATION!!! We going please tell us. Believe it or not, some people are actually more qualified than you, yep even black and brown folks. I know in my family alone we have: Neuro Surgeons, medical doctors, lawyers, chemist, educators, high ranking military enlisted and officers and News reporters for major channels, but they all have that 1 thing : EDUCATION and they have to EARN their positions and watch people with LESS get the positions. BTW, I watched young white girls get positions without experience because white men wanted their cute faces over qualified WHITE MEN, and us others!!! S\nI read both your posts and I totally disagree, if you really did your homework you will see that there are far more white soldiers in the military than there are black or any other race, and I know that LGBT isn’t a race or on any soldiers report card! Do I think that there is bias when it comes to promotions yes I certainly do, but to say that you have to black or queer (as you put it) to get ahead is just not true. Also there has NEVER been and will NEVER be Black or queer privileged in the military, and praying that things change says something about you!!!\nI am a third generation veteran who is currently APPALLED by the actions of the new presidential administration. Reading through the comments of my fellow vets, it is clear that the overwhelming majority DO NOT HAVE FAITH in Trump or Musk, or that their actions won’t end up hurting the VA. You know, so they can free up funds for giant tax cuts for the wealthy. What we really need now are strong advocates for the VA, not apologists for Trump.\nIts interesting about the Office of DOGE Government efficiency is a big joke i am from CA so i am very aware of\nGovernment efficiency i continue to watch one of biggest income state in the USA 5th largest in the world going downhill every day because of the ridiculous spending of taxpayers money Just like some of the large major companies that have gone bankrupt because no one is controlling the expenses I hope that the rest of the country doesnt follow CA I just hope that Trumps effort to Make America Great Again Hasnt gone to far in Haste Makes Waste\nit would be better to proceed with caution\nI have no faith in this new administration. The lack of professionalism is astounding. All my years working with Veterans I’ve never seen such unprofessional behavior by a top leadership. This isn’t a campaign rally it’s a honorable institution serving honorable Veterans. Secretary your statement about not reducing Veterans Administration funds is a very empty statement. 1000 VA staff members have been fired. Many of them are Veterans and some are Disabled Veterans. You are a not in service to Veterans. You are only serving the traitor Trump.\nWell, at least the news is good, we’re finally getting what we voted for, even if the video link doesn’t work ( yes, I tried it in both email and browser, it doesn’t let me watch it because it says I’m not signed in, even though I’m signed in over on YouTube. And it doesn’t give me an option to sign in on the video itself).\nYou are an absolute liar. Lying to veterans is a total disgrace.\nIf you think trump/musk care about you, you are not very intelligent.\nnever trust trump and musk to do what’s right for veterans. I understand there could be a real reason behind the job cuts, but I’m do not understand the inhumane way it was done — no respect\ntrump is a draft dodger and has already called veterans “suckers and losers”. He does not care\nYou sound like a liberal communist. Trump cares about Veterans . Biden had soldiers sleeping on a garage floor, Trump put them in his Hotel. He is cleaning up government waste and strengthening our military and stopping this woke crap. Things will be way better under this administration. I’m sick of ignorant people commenting negativity.\nHey Kiva, Sounds like you should do a bit of fact checking before you accuse people of sounding like a “liberal communist” and being “ignorant people commenting negativity.” How do you interpret Trump caring for veterans when he faked a bone spur to dodge the draft, calls us suckers and losers and does not want to be seen in our company? Maybe you’re watching too much Fox News.\nWrong, Trump doesn’t care about veterans or the military, never has, never will. Maybe you should wake up, read something other than drivel, and realize you’re supporting a draft dodging coward.\nClearly, your TDS has warped your simple mind. Clinton was a draft dodger and all you dimocrats still worship the Clintons. Trump never called our veterans “suckers and losers”. Where was your outrage when Biden said “clap, you stupid bastards” right to our active duty military? Typical dimocrat hypocrite!\nYou might look into just who the new sign in procedures are supposed to be helping. I am an 82yo Vet who has been using the MyHealth.va site for probably as long as it has been in existence with varying degrees of success. Now comes the new double sign, double verification system which is completely beyond my grasp. I have spent many hours trying to comply but as things stand now, On March 4, I will no longer be able to access my information. I suspect this is make work for contractors. How do you “make thing simpler by adding extra steps? Anyway, I’ll survive until I don’t. Good luck in your new position.\nHi, William. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nThanks for sharing that was total BS. You should be ashamed of yourself.\nDon thinks we are suckers\nand so must you.\nI’ve had several issues with injuries/issues caused from the military service that have been denied several times. I really don’t expect anyone under Doug Collins or, Doug Collins himself to read this, but my faith in the VA is very little.\nHi, James. Thanks for commenting. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nThank you for caring for our veterans.\nI feel like we have one of our own (veteran) watching our six. All the best to him and president Trump.\nThis is the “VA”!!!! I believe are benefits will probably WILL be taken away. It’s just a matter of time. We do not get any raises! Except for COLA. That’s all we are worth. I do not believe President Trump will take it away but I know we will NOT be getting any raises!!!!! We are veterans. They don’t get raises. They aren’t worth any more money than they are getting now. We can’t say a word in fear of it being taken away. It has taken 34 years to break the $500.00 mark of monitory payment. That’s Thirty four years!!!!!\nThis sounds good, but doesn’t align with reality. Perhaps the large # of VA employees released occurred after this video was cut. Regardless, it’s difficult to believe that this downsizing will improve services. There has to be an impact when those who operate and support the Veteran Suicide Hotline receive notices of termination. Veterans are reporting scheduled appointments are being canceled. The messaging from the VA needs to be factual and convincing. Today that is not the case.\nBut no medical personell have been terminated from the VA. Only staff positions, most of which were working from home and did not want to return to the office. Regardless, these personell were offered a buyout which many accepted.\nPersonally, I have had no problems with appointment or staff having received 2 appointments in the last month. I think that we need to be a bit patient considering that the new administration has made many promises and is working tirelessly to keep those promises. Cutting waste, fraud and abuse….Money that is going to politicians instead of to the deficit or the taxpayer… is going to go slowly but I choose to believe that the process will ultimately prove to be a good one for our country.\nPoliticians never fight so hard as when their illicit money is threatened and a lot of our politicians really seem to hate the idea of organizations like USAID being audited.\nLet’s not make it a problem before it is a problem. If you really think that there is foul play afoot you should contact your senator or congressman and voice your concerns.\nJust my humble opinions…. Thanks for your service !!\nLarge number? 1000 out of almost half a million VA employees. Probably like the FAA firings. Janitorial and lawn maintenance staff. I’m sure that will create a care problem from the medical staff. Or those doing claims.\nDoug: Tell me what DOGE and the Muskrats are cutting and eliminating that constitutes waste, fraud, and abuse in the VA. Tell me exactly how you and the Muskrats are improving efficiency. I’ve had enough of ‘it’s gonna be great’ BS. No transparency, no TRUST!\nElon Musk literally posts on x all of the fraud and wasteful spending that DOGE finds. Just because you don’t bother to go read the information, doesn’t mean that it’s not out there.\nI am positively tickled that we are finally purging these money laundering mafias like US”AID” that have infested our government, squandering tax victim money on ungrateful foreign parasites.\nI’ll believe it when I see it. With all due respect, I don’t buy anything that comes out of trump’s mouth, which makes me extremely disinclined to believe anything that you tell me, Doug. You seem to be in lockstep with this administration, and I don’t trust them at all. Trump likes to give lip service about caring for the troops and for our veterans, but his actions tell another story. The bottom line is, you have to prove it, or it’s just more glad handing and empty promises.\nI would like to know why so many Veterans that spent as much as 25 years in the military and took a government job that are at the end of their probation was cut just because they are on probation.\nThey spent their entire life in the military and now fired, regardless of their job and outstanding skills just because they had not completed their probation period.\nVeterans are losing their homes because our President doesn’t want to take the time see what their job is. If you are telling the truth then make Veterans on probation exempt.\nGood Morning. Thank you for reaching out with this video. Unfortunately, your words offer little assurance to the disabled veteran/military retiree communities. You talk about “media” stories mentioning “possibilities” that veteran benefits may be cut, that “means testing” may be used to determine disability benefits, and the privatization of VA services in general. I read a lot and can honestly say I’ve never read a story about veteran benefit cuts originating in main stream media outlet. What I’ve read are main stream media stories reporting on alternative media sites bringing forth this type of information. Isn’t that the job of the media? To inform us? You say none of this is true. Not surprising, you’re the only person saying this. You come across as a fast talking late night TV Cal Worthington and his dog Spot type car salesman. Hello! Red Flag! Here’s the deal. We all know your unwavering loyalty to the current occupant of the White House(forgive me, in no way can I type or say his name) got you the job. It’s just too difficult for many of us to trust you for choosing loyalty to a convicted felon over the millions of veterans you now serve. Good luck.\nThank you so much for communicating with us Veterans! Please keep on doing this. Maybe a monthly meeting online summarizing what is happening with the VA.\nWhen will these benefits be published in a handbook print again with ALL contact information.?\nWhen will the VA have a functional phone system that is user friendly to discover these benefits that only a few have knolage off?\nMr. Collins:\nThank you for your video about VA benefits not being cut. Your information is appreciated.\nA suggestion….begin your videos with the information you wish to share. Do not belittle the media. Much of what you criticized the media for is exactly what this administration is doing on a daily basis.\nI am proud to be a veteran. And I applaud the VA for the excellent care I have received. And I hope the VA continues to care for all veterans in the best ways possible.\nI am an elderly female veteran who lives on my VA and Social Security benefits . If this administration touches either of these two things, there will be an uprising like you’re never before seen. We’ve worked all our lives to get here, broken down and barely getting by. And I’ll be damned if I (and millions of others) will stand by and allow billionaires to play with our lives and our money!! Our government had better put protections in place and stop this madness going around!\nThank you so much for running this explanation. WE never know who or what to believe when so many negative “reports” come out the “liberal media”. So, it is really important that our SecVA comes right out and clears up the matter. JRMack, IL Army Vet\nWow! So much hate and discontent on this forum. I’m surprised the VA allows. This content to be on a veterans administration site. So many people really showing their ass. Sad. To the folks who screen these posts I would recommended to your chain of command, that this forum go away. The hate and finger-pointing here solves nothing. There’s a VA phone number to call and I’m sure there’s a VA email to send your grievances to. This forum is nothing more than watching MSNBC.\nAgreed. US ARMY vet.\nAmen my Brother Veteran. We served with Honor and our president Trump did us right in his first term, and why would he change now. Anybody remember serving under president Carter. I do.\nYou could always volunteer to not come here or comment yourself first. How about that & not parroting far right propaganda? I vote for that.\nI applaud the VA keeping all comments. It’s important. To provide some context, I’m a retired veteran (25 years, from E-1 to O4), and just yesterday, I was speaking with my neighbor and good friend who is 86 years young. He had tears in his eyes as he asked me if his 30 years of service (ending as CMSgt) meant anything, given the state of the government right now. Grow up and read the comments. You might learn something about people who’ve sacrificed and then who get the runaround, or worse. Not everyone has a great story to tell; some have reasonable grievances and concerns.\nVince, I totally agree with you!\nTell me how these DOGE clowns and Musk are qualified to tell Veterans what is a waist of money on them? Musk has never served in the military. He knows nothing of sacrifice or hardship.\nMusk is a naturalized South American……and the richest man in the world. Donnie despises him because he is richer than Donnie. His time will come\nMy faith in the VA is now in question. I don’t trust the officials in charge under this sorry presidency and administration. Waiting for the next Russian hammer to fall. I’ve had wonderful care for the past 30+ years and now I’m concerned. I’ve already had medication issues over the past year.\nI’ve already had medication issues over the past year….That would have been under Sorry President Biden.\nI appreciate all the good work that you and the new Administration are doing. Here’s a stupid question, tho – why is there a higher threshold & harder process for us veterans to get the help that the government’s already promised us, when they already have all our paperwork and we already proved ourselves to them, than it is to get welfare, even as an illegal? ??\nDoes *any* other government agency penny-pinch down to a fraction of a percent? Is that *really* a necessary part of the process when tax victim dollars are walking out the door by the billions and trillions unaccounted for (until DOGE), squandered on thankless foreign parasites?\nmy prayer is that your leadership will I have been trying to get my case settled since 2014 my claim was successfully remanded 10/2024 but still no settlement information to this date.\nIs the Russian hammer in the room with you right now? Geez, are you hearing yourself?\nDid anything happen to our VA benefits in the first Orange Age? No, my veterans disability claim was finally fully recognized only after president Trump with the VA into shape, and VA Healthcare massively improved (and then went back downhill under Creepy Joe).\nSrsly, seek out the mental health services on offer, this paranoid hysteria is not healthy, and is frankly unbecoming of a former servicemember. The Cold War ended over 30 years ago, let it go.\nThank you! People bashing Trump and saying stupid ignorant comments are ridiculous! A bunch of liberal Commies…\nWell, you folks keep on calling liberals commies–Right? Well how about Trump supporting Putin against Ukraine and Europe! Last I knew, Putin is a commie! But I bet you people love him as Trump does! Yupper, Putin is innocent regarding his invasion of the Ukraine. And it is Zelenskyy who is the Dictator and the Ukraine which started the war? Donald has serious mental issues it seems. And as for the VAMCs, if not for Democrats, they wouldn’t exist. Republicans time and time over the years have never voted to increase funding for veteran services! And in fact the opposite is true. They love pulling the wool over veterans eyes by putting forth their age old argument, that my cutting out waste it will help veterans, when in fact, what they really mean is that they believe way too much money is spent on veterans care and services.\nAnd as for you all complaining that you are waiting years for VA approval of care for your conditions, just read this and then go thank your Republicans for trying to do nothing to help our veterans:\n“The legislation is an attempt to hide the fact that House Republicans already voted to immediately rescind $2 billion from funding for claims processing and appeals, health care both within and outside of VA, research, and education and training for veterans as part of the Default on America Act.\nThis bill:\nDrastically underfunds by $14.7 billion the Toxic Exposures Fund, created with bipartisan support in the PACT Act to ensure veterans exposed to Agent Orange, burn pits, and other toxic substances will always be cared for.\nUnderfunds other veterans’ medical care needs by allowing the transfer of $4.5 billion in medical care funding to areas outside of health care.\nCuts funding for critical military construction. The bill backtracks on our promises to our servicemembers and their families by cutting military construction by over $1.3 billion compared to the current level.\nBuilt on a framework that fails to treat veterans’ medical care as its own funding category, thereby jeopardizing veterans’ health care.”\nBut regardless, thank you all for your service!\nBut I guess it was ok when it was Biden or Obama getting bashed…People have the right to their opinions, you don’t have to like it or agree but its their right, it doesn’t make them commies (as you call them), it makes them American!\nDear Secretary Collins,\nRegarding the 1000+ VA employees you just fired, what are you doing about them? Why fire them with NO heads up, in the dark of the night, no severance, or opportunity to move to other positions? What about those VA employees that you pulled the rug out from under who are Veterans that wanted to serve the Veteran community by working for the VA? Those who you fired that are Veterans, disabled Veterans, who moved cross country specifically for that job? For those who are living paycheck to paycheck that now may need to seek out homeless services?\nFrankly, if you want to cut costs, try examining the obviously CORRUPT Compensation and Pension “examination” process!!! I’ve been to numerous of those hideous “exams” where the “examiner” flat out LIES on their DBQs/opinions!!! Seriously, they flat out LIE!!! And even though the Veteran is supposed to have the benefit of doubt, the VA ONLY goes by the lying C&P “examiners” who strategically move the conversation from the Veteran’s symptoms, issues, residuals, etc., etc. to get the Veteran off track and then say, “Well, we’re out of time, now. Thank you for coming in.” And they got their nice big pay check and bonus from the VA!\nThe Veteran NEEDS to be able to have access to the blank DBQs ahead of time, to submit DBQs from their own doctors who know the Veteran better, and have immediate access to the C&P “examiner’s” completed DBQ/opinion immediately following it’s completion… PRIOR to the VA making a decision, so the Veteran has a chance and PLENTY of time to respond appropriately! That whole system is corrupt, corrupt, corrupt, and causes far too much stress and anxiety to Veterans who already experience much of that! And I know I’m not the only one who knows this.\nSUGGESTION – reach out to YouTube channels: CivDiv and Veterans InfoTap (or Veterans Daily which is a collaboration between the two).\nAll that said, I understand the reason behind the job cuts, but I’m at a LOSS for the nasty, deceitful, and inhumane way you went about it… much like running those employees, and their families, over with a bus!\nPlease do something to help them get back on their feet after this disaster? Are you going to help them with job placement services? Food assistance? Rent/mortgage assistance? Please do SOMETHING for them!\nAlso, PLEASE do something about the anxiety inducing corrupt C&P “exam” process!?\nThank you for your attention, and for tolerating my “passion” and deep frustration with this “system”!\nThank you for your service, and God bless!\nSandra (Sandy) Sutter\nHow is firing long-term employees ( a lot of them are Veterans themselves) helping to streamline our services? Will you stand up for us when things are wrong? Or are you just going to let Musk cut our programs that help Veterans????\nMR Collins,\nHow can you possibly believe, we believe,\nthat Trump/Musk will leave the VA unscathed?\nMusk is tearing thru the Gov’t agencies at alarming speed, with NO oversight. He is not an elected official, nor does he have the authority to de-evolve the Govt just because Trump has such a big grudge against everybody.\nMusk is overbearing and has ABSOLUTLY no cares for/about US Servicemembers. Neither does Trump.\nWill you RESIGN if your statements prove UNTRUE?\nBy the way this was on the latest feed from Military.com , “VA Crisis Line Employees Among Those Fired Amid Federal Workforce Purge”\nGood afternoon, Sir. I just read about the lies that the VA is looking into cutting down service for us veterans. At the same time, you just stated that is not true, thank God, please keep doing whatever you can for us Sir. I wrote a letter to our REAL President Mr. DONALD TRUMP, about the fact that us veterans must wait years after we applied for our disability. I applied back in May 1923, and I am still pending for that to be resolved.\nI personally, have seen other veterans that have waited for a very long periods of time, and the representatives that are performing this process, at the VA department, I am not sure of what the problem is, but it takes years to receive their so needed and well-deserved disability pension after serving our country, and plenty of us, like in my case, I was exposed to Agent Orange during my service in the Army while in Korea during the times specified by the V.A., within the notification that I received in order to apply, the VA informed me that I qualified to apply for a disability pension.\nI have submitted every piece of documentation, including letters of support from all my doctors’ Nexus Letter on my behalf my documents that the VA asked for, but I am still waiting for a positive resolution to my case.\nI am now wearing a pacemaker because I had a stroke back in 2023, receiving an IV Infusion once a month, and according to Doctor Viviana Temino, MD Section Chief, Allery & Immunology under her treatment since 2014 and I must continue receiving the Infusion for the rest of my life do to the fact that I was exposed to Agent Orange, also now I have spots on my lungs do to the same exposure and I am also been treated with Sulfamethoxazole 800mg 4 capsules a day for the infection in my lungs for at least six months. Furthermore, I have to take numerous medications every day, three different inhalers because of COPD and Asthma, blood pressure medication, blood thinners because of the stroke because different blockage in my veins, including my brain and to top it all, I also have been seen by the Psychologist due to all the stress and a counselor once a week because all the waiting, going into three years. Medication for my stomach, (acid indigestion). Under the care of DR. Eduardo J Lopez M.D. with the Blue team at the VA Hospital, him, Dr. Lopez, also reiterated the fact of that my treatments are forever Dr. Italo Novoa M.D., my cardiologist, and I am constantly going to the VA hospital for all the treatments that I need plus all the medications that I have to take daily because my immune system has been destroyed by the effects of the Agent Orange that was, not only this chemical agent was sprayed in Camp Stanley because of this camp was so close to the DMV zone, but also was stored in the same camp, Camp Stanley.\nPlease Sir, we can use all the help that we can get.\nThank you,\nArmando G. Torres\n[Editor: Please do not publish your SSN or other personal information on the internet. I have deleted it from your comment.]\nAre you claiming to be over 120 years old and that agent orange was used in Korea rather than vietnam? ? Something about your story doesn’t quite add up.\nI know how you feel. Took me several years to even get my records. Vetrecs kept telling me they didn’t have them.\nWith all due respect Sir, you must be the oldest veteran alive. Thank you for your service.\nIn other words, “DOGE” which doesn’t really exist, does have access to our personal records. Thanks for clarifying.\nthey are screening emails. Trump: “Senator McCain was a loser “he got caught” You Trump-loving vets need a reality check. Trump was Never a friend to vets. His only friend are stacks of 100 Ben Franklins. He refused to visit the American cemetery when invited in France…and then labeled them “Suckers & Losers”\nFour more years of lunacy. I pray we still have a country after he’s gone. Don’t forget, he is challenging the 8-year term limit. He wants to be a Putin or Stalin. Die a King.\nIt’s funny, after president Donald J Trump took office, my veterans disability claim was finally fully recognized, and I got enough of those Benjamins that my wife and I were able to buy two homes.\nJessica, please look into the mental health services offered by the VA, this hysterical paranoia is not healthy.\nAs for mccain, well he should have known better to stay a hero rather than letting himself become the villain. Please, enlighten me as to what is respectable about an old man wanting to throw young men into a meatgrinder of *his* political ambitions?\nSpot On Jessica!\nNice try! Got any other fantasy BS you’d like to share with us! Got to admit that people like you sure have learned from your dear leader, how to lie so well!\nTDS – was debunked!\nhttps://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/06/27/biden-trump-first-presidential-debate/about-those-suckers-and-losers-00165625\nJessica, quit telling lies….. Trump loves the Veterans….. sucker and looser was more then once debunked as a lie…. you people get all upset bc he wants to clean house. you know there is a lot of waste in the VA….. office staff is the once who got let go, didn’t want to go back to office, nor medical people……. I had never problem with my VA in Asheville, you believe anything the left made you belief…… you had no problem the media told you Biden was fit for 4 years, I bet you voted for crackling Camel\nTrump did not refuse to visit the American cemetery in France.This excerpt from American Military News offers an explanation: “President Trump reportedly had no say in the decision, as the Marine Corps and White House Military Office made the determination collaboratively with the Secret Service that Paris’ overcast and rainy conditions posed too much risk for Marine One to fly to Aisne-Marne, which is about 60 miles northeast of Paris.”\nHow many of the staffers fired were veterans themselves?\nCan you tell me how many veterans have already been fired from government jobs\ni am a Viet Nam veteran. i was exposed to agent orange. I am receiving benefits because of this exposure. please continue your vigilant concern regarding veterans benefits. Thank you, John Brich\nI see you are a TRUMP fan so I do not know what to believe.\nFirst and foremost advice, stop the politics. This video and message grated on my severely. An assurance that benefits will not be cut would have sufficed. I assure you, inserting politics into the MISSION of serving veterans will only lead to undesirable outcomes. I previously worked at the VA at the management level and political stances and opinions are not to be voiced publicly.\nThank you for the reassurance, good luck, and best wishes in your new position.\nFor the moment, I will take the Secretary at his word that VA benefits will not be cut. In comment on his remarks about DOGE and the press, I emphasize the following: First, it is the responsibility of Secretary Collins and his staff to fetter out any fraud, waste, and abuse. Our tax dollars fund this audit and investigative function of the VA and other law enforcement agencies. Elon Musk and DOGE should not assume this duty. Second, the rule of law and ethics in government matter. Musk is riddled with conflicts of interest as a large government contractor and an owner of regulated businesses. Numerous Americans have lost their federal jobs based on the untruthful disparagement of federal agencies and disregard for the rule of law. We have regulations that provide fair procedures for the reduction of the federal work force and expenditure of our tax dollars, which have been dashed by DOGE. (BTW, the name “DOGE” is an unethical promotion of Musk’s favored cryptocurrency and misleading because it is not a Department of government.) Third, demonizing the press has long been a tool of regime change. Information is power and both Musk and Trump control significant media outlets. Secretary Collins should not attack the press, especially when transparency in government is in peril. (As an aside, our names and emails are required to post on this site. I do not consent to allowing anyone connected to DOGE to have access to my email. )\n“An” email address is required, but it doesn’t have to be yours. I’m using Senator Rand Paul’s\nI’m so excited about our new administration straightening this mess out. I’m a veteran and a RN and know first hand the system is broke. Change maybe hard but it’s very much needed! You have my full support! I’m thankful accountability and common sense are now being used, years late but better late than never.\nI have no faith in the VA as long as Elon (the Pillsbury Doughboy) is in charge. Keep politics out you say? Impossible. Everything about the grift-meister Trump is politics. Victim politics. Retribution politics. If put my name to this post, guaranteed he and his band of adolescent hackers will ferret me out and deep six me in the VA system. Trump IS a pathetic example of a human.\nDo you deny Trump & Elon are using the presidency to profit beyond their wildest dream? Wake up-smell the coffee.\nWhat does any of that hysterical paranoid rant have to do with the good news from the va?\nPlease, look into the mental health care services that are on offer.\nWhy would we trust what you are saying? Time will tell and I hope you are legitimate, prepared and successful in protecting/improving our care. Thank you.\nI had to wait 3 months just to get a dentist appointment. I’ve been waiting 3 months just to get community of care to approve a doctor that I’ve already selected. What the hell are you fools doing? No thank you King Trump. I don’t like what you’re doing.\nMy husband has to wait longer than 3 months!\nHi, Carl, thanks for commenting. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nRight!!! The firings have already started in the chem dependency program. Doug will role over like all the rest of the lackeys.\nP.S. I have been under the care of VA medicine at Lovell FHC for 20 years. I would not trade it for any amount of money. I’m not going to bore with how they discovered my Agent Orange cancer on my very first visit, or how they rebuilt a badly mangled foot from and accident, or any of the other dozens of services they have provided me over the years. I have sat in waiting rooms and listened to vets my age and younger complain about waiting 30 minutes. Complain about this. Complaining about that. OMG….millions of people in this country never get to see a doctor and these entitled little f-cks just complain about services they get for mostly free. I’m going to offer a totally white American suggestion. If you are so f-cking unhappy with VA medicine, take your sorry -ss back out into the private healthcare industry and die sooner.\nThe worst thing VA did previously was ordering referrals of Veterans to community service. VA administratorts , prior to referral, never checked the delays in the private sector service being requested, which in Albuquerque are ~twice the delay at VAMC. VA administrators never insisted on getting reports from the referral doctor, and paid for private care before checking that reports were received: payment should always be deferred until reports are in the VA record. A delay of 6 months to being seen in the private sector can change a cancer prognosis from operable to inoperable. All attenmpts to “privatize ” VA should be strongly resisted. In most cases VA offers the most rapid access, excellent care ,and adequate follow-up.\nA reduction in force is a reduction in benefits. Our VA office wwnt from 4 to 2 people, and changed the blood draws from appointment to walkin. My friend who has advanced parkinsons had to wait 2 hours for a blood draw. He is in no shape to wait that long. Please try to keep in touch with ground conditions so you wont look so out of it.\nBro, IDK if you noticed, but the VA offices have been short staffed ever since the red-plague lockdowns, just like every place else.\nIs there anything that this Musk “presidency” would lead you to believe anything they say ? unvetted..not elected…has added billions to his private funds…please, we had to take tests (ergo the ability read and comprehend) to join the military…we are not stupid!!!\nDid you pass a basic civics test about how the American government actually works??\nDo you understand that Elon Musk is *not* the president, nor was he on the ballot, nor can he ever be POTUS, because he’s South African by birth?\n“I’m happy to partner with them to find things we need to get rid of so we can put the money where it belongs… back with our Veterans.” So we “get rid of…”, people. Firing approximately 1000 staffers, is sure to help with veterans health, claims, well being, etc. Great quote from the White House clown show.\num….you do know there are 371K VA staff in America right?\nReally want efficiency get the contractors out of VBA. My experience is unimpressive. I was referred to a contract nurse to assess my heart. Nurse did not take an EKG. Nurse asked me about medication and measured my scars from the heart surgery. Later I received notice that I must have an echocardiogram and drive about 40 miles to the contractor’s site. I live less than a mile from from a hospital with clinics. Finally I was told I needed to get a echocardiogram and have it faxed by a suspense date. Called my cardiologist and arranged for the echocardiogram. Contractor is churing account for profit. Sent to a NP with post doctorial work in PTSD and the NP was to evaluate me for hypothyroidism. Said I had no symptoms. I suggested I had no symptoms because I have been on medication for years and treated by the head of dendrochronology at the Univ Maryland Upper Chesapeake Hospital He wrote a letter that said I he has been treating me for this for years and stated that I had something that was 30% disability in the law. VBA questioned. Seems the VBA contractor has a list of service providers and picks the next on the lit rather than a provider that is near the veteran. Look at that scheduling process.\nFunny my simple dependency update has been sitting untouched since submitted back in July 2024! Can’t imagine those actually needing something done when a simple dependent correction can’t move.\nReferring to Mr Thomas Lee your remarks\nSound like the cry babies protesting about our commander and chief that’s finally draining t he swamp\nAre you a disabled Vet? I am and it sounds like you are not…\nI am a disabled vet and agree with his comment\nWow the true TDS is someone who worships an orange, privileged, racist, silver spoon, veteran hating, criminal draft dodger.\nI agree with all the people pointing out that the Muskrats are not qualified to do any adequate work on saving money… except for moving it to Musk and other billionaires — and the criminal draft dodger, as you rightly point out.\nI also think that military leaders should hold strong to truth. If all people would speak up, we could stop the tearing up of our country.\nDOGE under Musk has only hackers. They have NO forensic accountants to look at the data they have stolen. The are yelling fraud and waste but can’t prove any of it, and they are not being held to account. I don’t believe that the VA should show then a thing unless there is oversight by competent independent accountants and others who understand how things work. Musk and his bunch no nothing about how government programs function and they have no idea how many people they have already seriously hurt. And they don’t care.\nAnother LIE from the musk trump regime\nAnd your evidence for this is where? Surely, as a fellow former servicemember yourself, you would have enough integrity to not be making false accusations, would you?\nYou and the new administration are cutting VA workers without justification ( or even knowing what they do) how is this going to help veterans ?\nAnother trump liar. Its sad you are lying to our brave veterans. And horrific that you support the self proclaimed King!\nHe doesn’t care about anyone including you. You are a pawn in his ugliness. He will get rid of you and retaliate against you too.\nVeterans deserve to be treated like hero’s, not rump and muskrat.\nI feel sorry for your family, they must be so disappointed and shameful you.\nI am extremely skeptical of what the Secretary is saying. What exactly is doge doing? What has the Secretary permitted them to access? There appears to be little or NO transparency!!!\nMr. Secretary, No, DOGE is not a government entity and the VA should NOT partner with musk.\nYou will be striped by so called DOGE and the veterans will suffer. Mark my word.\nEach tim Trump has said that something is off the table the cuts happen anyway. He said he would review his list of insurrectionists and if they were violent they wouldn’t be considered. Welllook what happened. Now he’s looking at Madicare. My dad CMSgt. Z.C. Littleton is 93 and served in the Air Force in SAC and involved in many operations during the Cold War including Operation Chrome Dome and in and out of Vietnam while we lived at Naha, Okinawa and Clark, PI. Don’t blame me if I don’t trust him at his word!\nWhat insurrectionists? Are you talking about the political prisoners that were kidnapped for simply exercising their First Amendment rights at a public government building? Yeah, you sound like another big mouth civilian Army brat who never actually took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution.\nNaval officer Robert A. Heinlein was absolutely right, it was a mistake to allow civilian political power over us by something as unearned as birth.\nAirman….you are so wrong. Killing a cop and causing multiple injuries to those protecting our democratic process, was not ‘Patriotic”. They should all still be in jail, not pardoned.\nCDR USN (ret)\nCDR, the only shooting was done by a Capitol police Lt who has since been promoted. He took careful aim, stepped forward and shot Ashley Babbott in the neck. Ashley bled to death as the camera rolled. WE saw this happen LIVE. And there were Capitol cops with long guns right behind her. A cold blood case of murder. That Lt should be in jail, not promoted. Only Capitol cops brought weapons on Jan 6.\nIt’s well documented that the VA recently fired one thousand probationary staffers. This means that benefits are already “cut” for those veterans who need VA services, as the pipeline will get even slower. I feel for my fellow vets who rely on the VA for healthcare and related services and I worry this will only get worse.\nWhy does the VA only allow 100% disabled people to access dentistry?\nthats avery good question i wanted to ask that My guess is that the VA Dentist clinic is most likely an outside referral\ngroup and the VA doesnt want to pay for anyone not havent 100 % disability\nThat’s actually a fantastic question, the answer to which I have searched for far and wide myself. The best that I’ve been able to find is an answer is that way back when, the dentist industry lobbied tooth and nail to not have to accept certain forms of insurance, and here we are today.\nThough that still doesn’t explain why the va’s *own* in-house dentist office is so hard to access even for those of us who are at 100% disability.\nHow many veterans died of Covid 19 from misinformation?\nSir, someone needs to advise you that the Veterans Crisis Line has been cut by approximately 1,000 employees. These people provide intervention when a Veteran is contemplating suicide – a recognized epidemic among vets. Please use your authority to get these people their jobs back with back pay. Allowing DOGE (an illegal and unconstitutional entity) to damage veteran healthcare simply cannot be tolerated. Any and all veteran deaths will be at your doorstep and for you to answer.\nFunny because already up here in Connecticut I’ve been knowington VA thinks I’ve already changed. Their people who are sending emails out to Veterans saying they’ll be out of the office until further notice people aren’t getting through it can be an hour and a half sometimes before you get through to somebody and the folks just seem to be in some kind of turmoil there. And I’ve actually heard it said that yeah we don’t know what’s going on but something’s going on. So when he started his conversation with Trump is doing what he said he was going to do I knew we were for an -ss wipe yeah I don’t think we need to believe this guy look at what’s actually going on they’re cutting people from the Veterans Administration I was told that the only people there weren’t cutting at one of the veterans Administrations are the nurses because they’re essential but yeah they’re chopping people left and right\nWe shall see! Are you sure that there are not medical professionals losing their jobs at the VA???? Because that is not what I heard! Not even those on a probationary hire??? Historically, the Republican Party has given nothing but lip service to the vets! Check it out see how many republicans voted against veteran’s bills! Prove me wrong! Rest assured if I or any other vet suffers any reprisals the news outlets will be notified.\nYou understand president Donald J Trump is not the Republican party, right? He’s the fire we elected to burn the GOP to the ground, and on its ashes build an actual pro-America party.\nBut let’s talk about how many bloodthirsty Democrat cowards sent our people to die in unjustified illegal wars ( fun facts, every American war after World War II has been unconstitutional because it hasn’t actually been voted for by Congress), or how Democrat Golden Boy JFK wantingly sprayed agent orange on our troops knowing that chemical warfare was illegal.\nthey didn’t vote against Veterans, they voted against the pork the Democrats added to the Bill. They only said “veterans” to blast Rs. The worst R was mcCain who voted against Americans, including veteran.\nRemember that his boss called us veterans “suckers” and “losers”.\nDon’t be a sucker or a loser. We worked hard and lost much for the benefits we have.\nHis boss has a 50 year record of reneging on promises. Do not believe him or any of his mouthpieces.\nIam a veteran never had any problems with VA or care . One think I believe tho is that Combat Veterans should never have to beg or depend on anyone but the Goverment to take care of them if you are a combat Veteran you deserve everthing you need to help get your life back and their spouses and kids should also be on the health insurance. Combat Veterans are entitled to more period\nDoug Collin’s word is not enough. There is a $6 billion budget shortfall for 2025.\nOn February 13, 2025, the VA announced the termination of over 1,000 probationary employees with less than two years of service. These dismissals affect various roles, including researchers in mental health, cancer treatments, addiction recovery, prosthetics, and burn pit exposure.\nI don’t trust a word from Collin’s as he was selected by Trump both of them are pathological liars.\nIn their Budget they show $9 trillion in cost savings. No comment on where the savings are coming from;. Trump is not sharing this as he is simply arraigning as none of this will matter anymore.\nMr. Collin’s,\nAnything that has to do with improving the VA and Doge is an oxymoron! Cuts to help improve? Layoff notices at the Milwaukee VA or any other VA facility? Vets have seen this disrespect from our Commander in Chief before. Do not insult me with this BS. You should know better.\nHmm, tell that to the vets working at the VA who got laid off for BS “poor performance”. Vets are speaking out how some of them got stellar performance reviews only to be let go days later. Way to look out for us vets. As some have pointed out, especially those who were laid off with disabilities, there is legal recourse for wrongful termination.\nMy husbands appeal has been waiting for a judge for years. His body is breaking down due to his past military career. He is in constant pain. He fought Multiple wars and conflicts. Gulf war veterans are being pushed aside. He was one of the first to cross the burm to Iraq in the ACE tanks. He don’t even try to talk about Somalia or the other conflicts. These men deserve better. Please help these soldiers. They fought for us and risk their lives for us. The government doesn’t have time to waste. Make our Veterans a priority!!!\nAmen ! Praying your husband gets his help asap.\nfirstly this site should not be used to attack the media or your political enemies Mr Collins. secondly I’d like to say that I have been very satisfied with the service that I’ve received from the VA both in Iowa City Iowa as well as in Des Moines\nSUBMIT A CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY TO YOUR STATES CONGRESSMAN. THEY FORWARD YOUR REQUEST TO THE VA AND THE VA IS REQUIRED TO RESPOND WITHIN 72 HOURS OF RECEIPT!! This action should expedite the claim. It did when I did it.\nI find it interesting that the day after this article posted, another article talked about VA people being laid off and the crisis line purged. Anyone who thinks our benefits aren’t on the chopping block is drinking the koolaid.\nAnd you expect us to believe this? VA staffing has already been cut by Trump. We have fewer VA representatives at different levels than we had two months ago. You are completely right about the media and how they work. But their spin on things is nowhere close to the spin that the government puts on things expecting us to believe them. And it has been worse these last two months with all the government firings and the cuts, human and financial, at many of the government offices. Why do you continually believe and treat us as if we are so stupid we cannot figure this out and are not able to know the truth? And the truth about DOGE and their requests and demands for personal information does nothing to help any of us, but is another verification of us losing our personal and private lives and information. This information they receive will do nothing but hurt American individuals. That can be verified easily by looking at the person that is in charge of that.\nThe VA already does not have enough employees in healthcare to provide veterans with healthcare services they need. Which means if Doug Collins and the VA are working on good faith to improve veterans access to healthcare, they should be hiring new employees, not firing va healthcare workers.\nAnd a lot of those unnecessary VA workers y’all just fired were veterans, disabled veterans, and spouses of veterans. Y’all are actively harming the veteran community by firing these folks.\nDoug Collins and the federal government can do all the hand waving and all the complaining they want about the media. I have eyes and ears. I don’t need the media or government officials interpreting reality for me.\nDoug Collins is up here pissing on veterans, and telling us it’s raining outside.\nI find these statements to be very bland and general in nature and appears to be a casual sound bit and a shot at the Fourth estate. The What quality control measures for contract performance were in place when you took office? How much time did you personally spend verifying this before bringing in an outside entity to do this routine job? Why don’t you use your inspector generals to do this task that they routinely do? How many VA employees have been terminated to date to “improve service”? How many of those terminated employees were veterans? This appea\nExcellent information grate to have you on board Honorable Collins.\nGreat report I am a 80% TBI Disabled awarded 100% Unemployability Benefit. USArmy Military Police in the Vietnam Era conflict.\nThis from The American Prospect:\nIf left unchallenged by VA patients and caregivers, veterans’ organizations, and members of Congress, Trump’s appointee will continue to slash and trash services for veterans long after Elon Musk has likely returned to the private sector.\nOn the same day that protesters assembled outside his new office, Collins dismissed 1,000 probationary employees at the VA, while claiming that this move “will not negatively impact VA healthcare, benefits, or beneficiaries.”\nIn a quick rebuttal to Collins, Murray pointed out that those laid off included staffers working on treatments for vets with cancer, respiratory problems, missing limbs, and opioid addiction. “I’m hearing from longtime VA researchers in my home state of Washington who are right now being told to immediately stop their research and pack their bags,” Murray told the press.\nWho got all the money for healthnet in 2017 ?\nWe all know who you really work for, so save the empty promises. Why not be transparent and just tell us when your billionaire business daddies are planning to sell us down the river. I would rather be able to prepare for losing my benefits so I can at least try for a soft landing.\nI hope you have enough of a spine to stand up for us to the Musk/Vance Whitehouse because we will not forget, and we will not forgive.\nYou can talk to me about the weather, which I have no control over, or you could outline the services you’re making available to help me deal with the weather…and yes, part of that is making sure service providers have the support they need to be effective at what they provide. This felt a bit too focused on the weather.\nVery party line here – I take issue to the kids at DOGE having such access without being vetted. I would think that there would be forensic accounting involved – not hackers if the intent were to find waste.\nI’m on the same page as you. Although I don’t take issue with “vetting” per se. I take issue with granting what amounts to top secret clearance to guys with backgrounds that should be disqualifying.\nI mean, take Elon Musk as an example. Soldiers and veterans can lose jobs/clearances for pissing hot, but if you’re rich enough you can do drugs on a podcast and I guess that’s okay.\nMine has been stuck at level 5 since Dec 30th 2024. It’s supposed to take a couple.weeks. I need those benefits. So much for faster more streamlined.\nMine is stalled since September of 2023\nThey can cut costs at the Syracuse VA medical center they have a whole floor dedicated to female veterans but r sending us out to community care for mammograms they don’t do them there\nFrom a retired (100% disabled) sailor since 2002. The Minneapolis VA has treated me for numerous ailments and in most cases have done well. There is always room for improvement and the outside eyes of DOGE are probably best suited for determining what is best. What has been televised as cases of waste, fraud and abuse are mind boggling. May there be consequences and the punishment fit the crime.\nWelcome to the club and keep the bow into the wind!\nno evidence or proof of crime has been presented\nMy do AA has been stuck at level 5 since Dec 30th 2024. It’s supposed to take a couple.weeks. I need those benefits. So much for faster more streamlined.\nI don’t believe you as you were selected by Mr Trump.\nWhat is happening in every aspect of our government is abhorrent.\nRemember Privacy Act of 1974.\nThis was drummed into us when I was in the military.\nCollins is never going to help the vets find easier, more affordable care with continuing cuts, lay offs and hiring freeze. He, like virtually every other trump appointee are all going to kiss his a** and sing the praises of Musk.\nI agree!!! 57 days for a primary care visit, unless special circumstances or 100% disabled you can’t even get routine cleaning at dental, specialist without referral is not possible at my VA. Pulmonary only 2 days a week at my VA despite pact act. There is a local clinic that sees no new patients without being on waiting list for year or more. 80 miles one way to VA. Trying my best to move most to community care. Not best choice but 2.7 miles away. Did get Pulmonary care moved to community care. Have had my CT, Pulmonary fitness test and pulmonologist visit all within 10 days versus weeks. Same old story with most people here.\nLast, the question regarding vietnam and agent orange deaths. Here is just my personal story. Raised in town of less than 1000 people. Tons of fathers were WWII vets so lots of us went. 5 died in country, 7 more since of AO exposure have died. I have severe COPD, one of friends severe Parkinson, 2 more with kids born with spidabifada (sp). Same with every small town around me. Until PACT VA flat didn’t acknowledge. It’s going to get worse. I’m 75. Like the vets before us most vietnam vets dying quickly. Damn shame I believed the promise of health care for life when enlisting.\nUnfortunately, my comfort level is not very high.\nI would at least hope for status quo at a MINIMUM.\nAnother LIE from the trump musk regime!\nI would like to see spouses having CHAMPVA able to be treated at VA clinics. They are lifeline of assisting their disabled spouses.\nAs a DAV Chapter Service Officer I am very pleased that you have not hesitated for a moment to set the record straight. I have already heard from veterans that are concerned about their disability claims and THANK YOU for getting in front of the issue. ANYTHING that you can do to assuage their concerns by using every means possible to communicate with them is appreciated.\nI’ve had very little problem with the Va. they have helped me get my health back. I have talked with many other veterans and they seem to appreciate the va’s help. I don’t know what I was doing without those doctors and nurses. I believe Trump will do a great job for all of us.\nTim I am with you 100% on that. I am a combat vet . 100% disabled and have had and having outstanding care through though the VA. A lot of the post here just sounds like Dem. talking points. I remember a President in the not to distant past, that said, let the injured Vet pay for his own care, after all he volunteered for it.\nI don’t believe Mr. Collins has a clue. Anyone who praises Trump, says he’s doing a wonderful job, and DOGE is doing a great job, does not live in the real world. He is a Trump ass kisser. Laying off people who provide help and support to veterans is not a sign of waste, but is a way to discard veteran’s needs. Being on the job for one week and making the comments he did doesn’t instill my faith in him.\nThank You Doug! Please keep us informed. Looking for wonderful things for our Veterans , spouses, widows/widowers, families! We need to know that our President Donald Trump and you have got our backs.\nNo they don’t have our backs, they’re kicking our -ss.\nLOL . . . they “have your backs” alright because that is where they are going to stick the knife.\nI need very little care from the VA. I am very satisfied with the care I have received for 50 + years. I very happy with the changes which have occured over recent years. I know and it is a matter of common sense that people are proned to take advantage of any system. Vets and non Vets alike. I am glad this sort of thing is being vigorously addressed because the ones who do need it most suffer. Thank you, Mr. Collins\nI HAVE HEARING AIDS FROM THE VA I USED TO GET THEM SERVICED AFEW BLOCKED FROM MY HOME\nNOW THE VA WANTS ME TO DRIVE 75 MILES TO LEBNON TO GET SERVICE. I AM 86 YEARS OLD AND\nDONT DRIVE FAR ANYMORE SIPES EYE CARE IN HANOVER PA DID SERVICE THEM UNTILL FEB 2025\nDONT MAKE ANY SENCE TO ME.\nTHANK YOU, EDWARD YINGLING, HANOVER PA\nHi, Edward. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nTime will tell the tale.\nRead comments, lot of bitter vets. I am a disable vet. I will not jut anyone on 14 days on the job. When my check gets cut or I cannot visit the VA clinic the I will beleive the media. DOGE is trying to cut waste and abuse I don’t care how old they are just find it, $600 million for sushi . Every president since Regan has promised to cut the budget finally someone is doing it and we are bitching. Only Hon Discharged Vets, disabled or abled, should work in the VA!\nI beg you all to research the nonsense you see on Facebook and Fox news, which you then repeat as fact. I recommend politifact, which is non-partisan. Elon Musk never said that he found $600 mil spent on sushi (https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/feb/06/facebook-posts/no-fishy-food-bill-elon-musk-didnt-say-pentagon-sp/). Don’t get me wrong. I am NOT a Trump fan. I do not believe that Secretary Collins is being truthful. DOGE is a train wreck being used to hurt hard-working Americans while lining the pockets of million/billionaires. I do NOT think Elon Musk, has any business in our government. But, you’ve GOT to stop gobbling up the nonsense from FB and Fox and regurgitating it.\nHe’s lying like the rest of the unqualified people Trump has infiltrated our country with.\nThe Congressional Budget Office recommended ending TDIU benefits for those 67 and older. This is a joke, as Social Security benefits are continually being reduced and it is meant to be a supplement to retirement, not a retirement. In addition, TDIU Veterans do not receive retirement plans like they would if they could hold a job, so they likely would not be able to live on Social Security alone. Someone needs to fight on these issues.\nAlso, I attempted to add my 18 year old daughter in August when she enrolled in college, so she could use her DEA benefits. It’s been six months, and despite having all the necessary paperwork, it hasn’t moved passed initial review. I contacted the White House Hotline and requested assistance. The response I received from the Regional Office was “wait your turn in line.” Six months to add one dependent is absurd.\nLet’s talk about the 2017 Mission Act\nReferring to Mr Thomas Lee your remarks\nSound like the cry babies protesting about our commander and chief that’s finally draining t he swamp\nAs a 90+ YO Korean Vet. I’m sick of the bitching and bellyaching from the cry babies who think Biden did the American Veterans a great service. How did he handle the withdrawal from Afghanistan? My take is that that after visiting a Naval Air Station that celebrates gay and lesbian behavior with signs that they should be proud of their degenerate behavior. What is this costing us veteran in lost funds and access to healthcare? Get educated and thank God we have a chance to turn this country around. Don’t give up and KEEP FIGHTING.\nLet’s talk about the failure of Healthnet 2017\nExcelente News Sir. I’ve trying to get and increase in my disability % over 20 years (imagine it) and nothing has happened. This time I had to hire a lawyers so he can help me with this issue he charges 33.3% of what ever I get… if i get it. My health issues have increased since then; i don’t what to do anymore.\nI have received excellent care at the Tucson VA for over 20 years, and would not like to see their ability to care for veterans in a professional, timely (yes, timely), and caring manner impeded. So far, what the “lying” press has published about the manner in which Trump and Musk have handled the so-called elimination of fraud and waste – without having a clue as to what has actually been taking place, or delving into the ramifications of knee jerk reactions to their “revelations,” seems spot-on. Good luck on seeing the ongoing chaos bringing and semblance of positive results and improving the operations of the government.\nWe still have low information voter’s. As you can see by their comments. They have TDS and there is no treatment or cure. They don’t remember when the lines were so long and TRUMP pushed thru the community care program.\nIt’s only a month. Take your meds and give it time. Make common sense suggestions and not bully / attack the ones trying to get their heads around this mess, it’s been going on for ages. Give it time.\nP.S. there are several people who just walk around the VA appearing not to have a purpose. Veteran, nurse or whatever : they need terminated.\nThere should be more cameras on records actions of veterans and the staff at the counters for appointments and greetings. People on both sides are unkind. There needs to be accountability.\nWe veterans have been pushed against thru the system and had such a hard time getting even our records. Be specific about issues!\nDon’t be pricks!\nClueless. Look around. Research. Even Google. Shame.\nWow, did you drink the orange kool-aid! Poor fool,\nThey fired and investigated the DEI consultants’ spending and found that they were spending 8 million dollars a year on DEI programs when some VA hospitals don’t have full staffing for medical teams. Talk about crossed priorities. When there are hospitals so undermanned that they can only provide limited service, that isn’t the time to be picky about the diversity of its potential hires.\nYou’re so clouded by their constant stream of bs that you can’t see the forest for the trees. Musk will cut whatever he wants because your guy Trump has no spine. He backed down to Putin just like we all knew he would, and he put unqualified, traitorous morons in positions they don’t even understand.\nYou really cannot choose a provider through community care. For primary care, I found myself in a waiting room with immigrants who are on the public dole. I don’t know if providers are chosen by bids submitted, but don’t be surprised over where you end up. The doctor, by the way, mumbled to herself never having seen such “clean” urine, as she was looking over the results.\nI would like to believe that he is being truthful and above board about VA benefits not being targeted for cuts, but the American people were told the same thing about Medicaid and now it’s on the chopping block. So I’m going to have to wait and see while reserving judgement because this administration has burned us before.\nWe need your protection as our current president call us suckers. We never forget. DOGE is political bullsh-t getting rid of the IG;s can only lead to corruption.\nPlease find a way in your heart to continue being a peacekeeper and not perpetuate propaganda. Let’s help this administration make America a better place. There is so much work to be done.\nPlease find a way in your heart to wake up Tamara. Have you not been paying attention to what’s going on in the government offices since Trump Took office? Mr. Trump has never had anything good to say about veterans and has called us idiots for serving our country. What branch of service did you serve in, Tamara? The truth is out there, take off your blinders, open your eyes, and get your fingers out of your ears, please.\nIt’s an insult to think THIS administration has Americas best interest at heart. When it’s his only self serving whims that DOUG and little donnie care about.\nYour newsletter is N- propaganda. U.S. veterans know how to treat N-s. Fck you.\nBS trump is screwing Veterans.\nI read most of the comments and was not surprised at what I saw. Some never addressed his video most were very bitter vets, understandable as I am a disable vet, but I can’t take it out on a man that has been on the job 14 days. This man was in HOR and before I start throwing stones at him I am going to give him a chance and see what he does. I will get it out of the way so no one has to guess, I voted for Trump and would do it again given the alternative. I find it interesting that people are worried about their personal info, your info is all over the place now. They know when you go to the bathroom! As for DOGE we will find out but they really don’t care who Richard is what they want to know is Richard ripping off and or scaming the american people. Reality is,read you own notes, Collins can do no worse than any of his predecessor. The only advice I would give Sec Collins is that he ONLY hire QUALIFIED VETERANS to work in the VA. There are plenty out there that are disable but want to work. Still plenty others that want to work. Some work in government right now that may be let go look to the VA if you are a Hon Disharged Vet. Think don’t cry!\nThank you Richard!\nDawn Nance\nArmy 1978-1981\nThank You Mr Collins I’ve been with the VA for about 50 yrs . VA has always treated me with the utmost respect and fairness . The hospitals I have been in gave excellent care . It makes me very proud to say I am a United States Veteran . Thank You Timothy Foley\nThe operative questions just who is to determine “What’s not needed”- some 19 year old kid who never served a day in the Military??\nwow there are a lot of negative comments on here , much like the old bots on twitter , I wonder if the same concerned people had any negative comments about the feckless D.E.I. hires from the last four years? My personal VA treatment is excellent, I hope this success reaches all vets that need it.\nSo true. Those that are in our right mind, appreciates common sense thinking.\nDOGE is conducting an illegal heist of our personal data, and by allowing these uncleared, unvetted, unqualified criminal vermin to access our personal data you are an accomplice to innumerable Federal felonies. Resign.\nSir,\nIf I recall, the young rascals working for Musk at DOGE came from Space Ex with much higher clearances and IQ’s than respondents in this column. WE HAD TO WAIT FOUR YEARS to find out what Biden had been up to, how about we give Trump and Musk four months?\nYou are so right and don’t think these kids aren’t going to sell your info to the highest bidder some where down the line when Musk is done with them. Follow the money……always sound advice!!!!\nComplaining about the President is not helpful. Mr. Collins needs your issues and your recommended solutions, not a diatribe of your feelings to make you feel better. The VA has lots of problems but if you are not going to help solve them them you’re the problem. – 34 year Marine vet.\nYour words are well spoken, Marine.\nWe’re not paid to solve them, but nice try passing blame to the disgusted vets that are commenting here. Take your trash to FB or X.\nI have a serious concern when the current Trump VA fired so many veterans whom were fired without notice and now become jobless. This is not respect. In my life I have never used any VA services and only I have asked for assistance to change mistakes make on my DD-214 and NOTHING has been done in the last three years. Nothing!! I am 77 years old and I served during the Vietnam war era. So as a Native American I am still strong, health and waiting for VA response and results on my DD-214. As old as I am I need the corrected document to apply for a bank loan. Thank you and may peace prevail and the saying goes “United we stand divided we fall.”\nHang in there Doug! Just ignore the comments from the ppl terminally infected with TDS. Their disease blinds them to the positive realities Trump is bring back to our country and repairing the damage done by 4 years of a dementia ridden DEMOCRAT being in office. Refreshing to see someone with testicles putting a stop to DEI, drag story hours, illegal immigration, weaponization of DOJ, etc, etc, and on and on. The LUNATIC LEFT is finally being put in check. Absolutely amazing how many ppl are blowing snot about DOGE saving BILLIONS of dollars of OUR tax money!\nWell said!\nHe is ignoring them. Have you seen any replies? Dougie boy is laughing all the way to the bank.\nChaplain Collins, please remember…God is watching you. Something you seem to have forgotten or chosen to selectively ignore thus far in your political career. A large number of your words, actions, attitudes, etc leading up to now don’t really peacefully coexist with His word and He will judge you. Simply a friendly reminder for you to maybe do some self-reflection and prayer. Which holds primacy for you…God or “politics”? Have a blessed day!\nI hope this is all true, as a VET who has just got qualified to be on the VA health system I am looking forward to using the VA health care system to help reduce my cost of health care and provide quality health care for me as a Vet. of the Viet Nam Era. As a new enrollee I will need to learn how to best use the VA system that will benefit my health care and cost there of.\nSecretary Collins: Thank you for your continued service in this important position. Our active duty military needs to be the most efficient , lethal fighting force on planet earth and space. And when their active duty time is complete as mine is , the men and woman need to transition into a well run VA and insure the injuries they have sustained are properly treated. God Bless you in this effort.\nJames Carter (USN 1974-1981)\nhear, here! Let us just thank god that time exists. This guy will go the way of all and we will recover. have faith that another day will come and we will prevail. It’ll only be two years until it all ends and we can make things right. Vote in mid-term elections in order to make this joker a lame duck president, as Milania already knows him to be: limp.\nI don’t believe a word any Trump appointee says. They are all liars and cheats, and only out for the bucks.\nThis tells me you believe everything that the media tells you and the Democrats tell you. Grow up and smell the coffee our government is no different than the corrupt governments in other countries and this current administration is pointing this out that some federal employees are corrupt some of our politicians are corrupt and taking the hard earned money that should be going to people that need it like disabled veterans. Instead of wasting it on people that have been dead for 150years. Just look at where Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security have been giving payments to people that have been dead in the millions of dollars that have been sent to whoever that should’ve been going to people that really need it and those of us that are getting close to retirement age. The system is going to be bankrupt because wasteful spending of money the people that are dead and the fact the new generation of Young adults are not having children to be brought into this mess of the medias that lies. My wife left the media in 2003 when Robert Murdoch walked into her office and told her to get rid of the accurate information of who, what, where, when, why and to credible sources willing to go on the record with their names in face to be published. It was all about getting the story out no matter how inaccurate it was to pay her salary she immediately quit. This anonymous source bull***** needs to go..\nIf you look at the people that are yelling the loudest they’re the ones with their hands in the cookie jar taking the money from the disabled veterans and people that need it truly in this country….\ntrump and musk are the loudest in the country\nPossibly of dental care ?\nI have 2 complaints One I called for meds and after waiting one week I called back was told they would order my meds, waited another week to finally receive my medication. I was with out my medication for 3 weeks, second I had an appointment at the Nashville VA. I put in for my travel and was only given a partial. The reason was stated I could have gone to a closer facility. I do not make this appointment the VA does and It was my cardiologist,??????\nThat is a prime example of what goes on everywhere. Thank you for commenting.\nHi, George, thanks for letting us know. We’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nI’m really surprised that a former military member would act in such a childish way in a forum that asked for comments, feedback, and opinions. What I’ve read is really embarrassing to even be in the same ranks as some of you people. Practice your writing skills and come across like a professional that hopefully you once were when serving. In order to balance the budget everybody needs to suck it up and expect cuts in every department of the federal government.\nApparently you think Trump is a honest person who respects women and people in general; and what did he say about soldiers and veterans ( we are dumb and stupid). So far the appointees to these cabinet positions are unqualified and uninformed in the organizations and departments they are now running. Of course he wants you to tell him what to do, he doesn’t have a clue. The current actions of this administration are not thoughtful, informed actions. Its the opposite and I quote, “we will drive them out of government service” that’s not the “will of the People”.\nActually it was suckers and losers.\nThis is your opinion, same as the rest of the posts.\nThe Vietnam war will of been over 50 years this coming May. My records have been scrubbed along with thousands of brothers with classified operations. I first started having “Agent Orange” in 1994. 6 bouts of cancer later, I still can’t get benefits. Is there going to be another delay of the Army releasing Vietnam classified service records. Please remember, Us of the classified operations. We are the “Sprayed and Betrayed” but each one of us would go back in if our nation needed us.\nI have great faith that Trump and his rookie Collins are planning BIG cuts to Veterans benefits and services!\nConcerns are being raised regarding the potential impact of new VA Secretary Collins on veterans’ benefits and services. The new secretary’s background and political affiliations are drawing scrutiny, particularly in light of potential budget constraints and policy changes within the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins, described as a staunch supporter of former President Trump, has previously expressed opposition to the Affordable Care Act, raising questions about his approach to healthcare for veterans. Furthermore, his past involvement in contesting the 2020 election results has led some to question his commitment to upholding democratic principles and the interests of all veterans.\nIn this video, Collins said he had been there only a week and there was already a problem (rite!) and then said not to listen to the media just to trust him bro. Some find his statements uneducated and unprofessional. Collins also rejects the scientific consensus on climate change.\nIn December 2020, Collins was one of 126 Republicans who contested the results of the 2020 presidential election. This action has been criticized as a dishonor to the House and a failure to uphold their oath to support the Constitution.\nWhile Collins has stated his commitment to serving veterans, his initial remarks have been met with skepticism by some, who are concerned that potential cuts to benefits and services may be on the horizon. Veterans and advocates are closely monitoring the situation, seeking clarity on the future direction of the VA under his leadership. Collins is the author of The Clock and the Calendar: A Front-Row Look at the Democrats’ Obsession with Donald Trump, published November 2021.” Not a good or popular book….\nIt is important for veterans to stay informed and engage with their elected officials to ensure their voices are heard as these changes unfold.\nMJ, 2nd Ranger Bat\nI support president Trump 100% Keep up the good work rhat you and your team is doing!\nFrom a vietnam veteran ??\nPeople are focused on the wrong thing of course thanks to media. I trust Doge to cut waste like they are everywhere else. What I’m concerned about is the proposed budget cuts recommendations written before the Trump administration that came out of the Congressional Budget office for 2025 to 2034 as a budget defeceit recommendation that would affect veteran benefits.\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-12/60557-budget-options.pdf?fbclid=IwY2xjawIkR6dleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHRH3c9KA4ojmwI3goVoZoj1NJUw5bnKSWzbsJu_WYJvP5_M1kyQSmSWHlw_aem_AOyjVclZFk48KhugaNMtQQ\nWith regards to DOGE and the benefits situation. There is a report that both the 30% rate is getting cut from compensation and that Unemployability is being taken out as a program moniker for the 100 % IU. What’s the truth, just what is the truth about the cuts announced in MilitaryNews.com. You’re praising DOGE as a watchdog group of sorts who are sorting through the contracts. A group of 20-something engineer grads are able to do accounting? Please.\nSecretary Collins, thank you for your service.\nI suggest a examining the connections between exposures to jet fuels that contain neurotoxins and cesium additives in JP-7 to the increase rates of advanced prostrate cancer.\nMany of us were unknowingly exposed to these toxins since they were classified top secret in years past. Anyone working around these aircraft were exposed because the aircraft did not have sealed fuel tanks and without being provided protective equipment due to the fact the additives were top secret during a special access / need to know program. We were exposed directly to the fuels and aspirated the fumes and burning exhaust of these fuels and ionized additives.\nWithout knowing of the hazards, we had to bring our fuel soaked uniforms home to be washed which cross contaminated our homes and further exposed our family members.\nCan we get some of the Doge money found to pay for dental work for vets. Our teeth take the brunt of all issues. PTSD sufferers grind our teeth, when we are sleeping, angry or just plain trying to figure out something.\nI have great hopes for what you will be doing for the Vets\nRE ptsd and teeth grinding. My dentist had a really thin tooth guard made I wear every night. Its actually helped me to stop grinding as much somehow (and it protects my teeth). If I stop wearing it I clench and grind again. Its worth trying one.\n60 day waits for Primary Care appointments are Unacceptable. It was less than 10 days till Republican s started chopping funding needs. Staffing and morale are at all time lows under Trump, are YOU going to stand up to Trump for Veteran needs or just cow down like the rest?\nBut it is in the Heritage Foundations budget proposal for 2023 amount things that Trump is currently actin upon. https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/policy-proposals.html\nStop blaming the “media” for when you say you’re doing “this” and then you do “that”. And Strump doesn’t know what he is doing anyway.\nRite brother\nAbsolutely! Truth!\nPlease keep politics out of Veterans Affairs. All you needed to say was you’re not cutting benefits. And then keep your word.\nThe funding comes from the Federal Government. Which is political.\nI totally agree to keep politics out of this. It’s a travesty he even brought this up. Focus only what you’re doing, not on a political leader’s policy you do or don’t support\nYeah, I caught that too. Once he said, “under Trump’s leadership,” he gave himself away.\nDon’t trust a thing that this administration says or does. Hope I’m wrong but so far there is no evidence to that.\nVery pleased and relieved our benefits are not going to be cut !! I had 11 hours a week for home health, which was not enough. You cut my hours back to 9 hours per week, which is terrible. I am wheel chair bound and have only my 85 year wife to help me the rest of the time. We get nothing but run around from the VA about who to talk to about more hours. The VA sends us to the VA advocate who sends us back to the VA primary Dr. (which they can’t keep) We have a beautiful new VA clinic here ,but it is not fully staffed. Sure wished we had the right person to talk to.\nThis outcome is exactly what should occur. I have attempted to explain this to others, but fearmongers prevent them from listening.\nMr. Collins, do you serve the veterans of the United States military and their families first or do you serve recently self-appointed king first?\nStop the Co-pay requirements for Vets Medical, doctor visits, and drugs!\nSir, you may believe what you stated (at least when this was recorded by you). However, Musk and Trump’s words and actions (including cuts of crisis staff and access to veterans’ personal dada) do not jive with your statements.\nthe va does everything to hinder old vets.I used to get online with the VA clinic in Niagara Falls ny..now I`m so confused with the changes .I can`t just get to my local va clinic anymore..Good going VA you made it hard for old vets\nSince you’ve only been there a week, I’m assuming you are a trump appointee. All trump and musk do is lie lie lie. How do we know if you are telling the truth. Nothing they have done is even legal. There is a right way and a wrong way to do things. You should be ashamed of yourself.\nI am assuming you are a Democrat….. all you/they do is lie, lie, lie. Go see a doctor for your chronic TDS!\nObviously, you thought Biden did a good job which means your opinion is moot.. The days of the Biden crime family is over with Their just auditing the government which is long overdue Relax and watch your country get saved.\nI agree. Dental Benefits would be so helpful. I need over 10K in dental care. The dental insurance offered is not economically or practically viable. It takes 6 months of pay in before benefits can be used, it has high deductible and co pays, it limits care per year such that it would cost at least as much if not more. It would delay and stretch out care beyond what is medically advisable. I now have problems with my jaw, TMJ. I think they call it (likely the result of arthritis in the jaw), but cannot get care without my teeth being fixed first. Like fellow veteran Tyrone Burns, I also need extractions and dentures. If expanding benefits is true, not just spin, please consider dental care for all veterans.\nI don’t have the same faith in Doge as Sec Collins has as it relates to cuts. So far they (Doge) are not attempting to gain procedural knowledge of any organization before making cuts. I agree waste should be eliminated, but done so intelligently.\nHow Many Nurses Have Been Fired At the VA?\nWhy Did Trump Say He Is The King?\nOkay. I’ll believe that the benefits won’t get chopped. However, I still don’t like, and don’t trust those tech guys at DOGE who have access to personal information, be it mine or other veterans like myself. And I especially don’t trust Musk. He and those tech guys that work for him know nothing about doing any kind of audit. He has another agenda which involves making him rich(er). He is also in league with AFD (Alternative for Deutchland). In other words, he is in league with white supremacists, or he is one himself, which to me, means ha cannot be trusted.\nHow many Doctors have Been Fired at the VA?\nGet rid of DOGE and Musk!!!!!\nHow Many Vietnam Veterans Died From Agent Orange?\nHow Many Veterans Have Been Fired?\nId like to know how many commissioners took the buy out, quit, or got fired. Im still waiting for my HLR to be seen, 3 duty to assist errors going back to 08.. lets git r done\nDental help would be nice for all vets.\nWhy Are Veterans being Fired?\nThank you for fighting for us! Keep up the good work and may God be with you in this struggle to take care of those of us who stepped up to serve this great nation!\nLet’s see, my physical therapist ran by MyMichigan Health care (a Community Care referral) after a year and a half of therapy, recommended an exercise bike to help with my service connected disability and from a failed surgery to my neck that left me extremely weak on my left side and wheelchair bound. My PCP also submitted a referral for the equipment. It was DENIED bymy VAMC Prostetics Department. I appealed and after 2 years, I gave up and bought my own. No reimbursement for the equipment. Next, I am wheelchair bound, I have tried to get a chairglide put into my entertainment area of my house, I was issued 2 in Colorado. They sit in my garage currently and all they need is to be installed. The VA here installed a new one going to my bedroom but says they can’t install the ones I have that were issued by the VA to the entertainment area of my house because they can only issue 1. So I have these two sitting in my garage now and can’t afford to pay myself to get one installed to the entertainment area (basement). A quote to install is roughly $1,600. Again, being wheelchair bound, I have carpet in my home, and I’ve been trying to get help (2 times DENIED SHA/SAH) with the removal of it so my wheelchair is easier to navigate in my house. I was offered the $6k HISSA (sp) grant, but when I got a quote to remove the Carpet and replace with hardwood or similar, the quotes were at the lowest $24K and that was just the hallways, living room and my bedroom. I keep getting letters and emails about all the wonderful benefits that await Veterans in my situation, but when you apply for the benefits, like with the exercise equipment, flooring and chairglide installlation, you either Beg the VA until you give up and buy yourself or do without because this just seems like the old “bait and switch” game. Yes, I am 100% (Actually combined 750%) disabled per the rating scale. I only get paid for 1-100%, I took a 50% cut in pay from what my job paid me annually to accept the VA’s 1-100% rating because I was declared unemployable due to PTSD, TBI, White Matter Disease, Meniere’s, Depressive Disorder and sedentary lifestyle brought along with it DMII, OSA and heart problems which have required 3-stents.. If you mean what you say, why are us Veterans being put through the vigerous hoops? I am glad you are cutting back on the unnecessary cost to run the VA. I just hope the differences are returned to the Veterans as you say because as I described above, it has been really challenging to get the benefits I need and in the begging process have had to reach out to my Patient Advocate (which is a joke), my Congressman on two occasions, OIG on two occasions and am about to reach out to them again because service connection hasn’t been awarded for 6-post-op secondary disabilities that weren’t present before the surgery and didn’t start with treatment/medication until after my condition begain deterriorating Post-op! I am only 1 example as I am sure many others have experienced my plight first hand. We just feel at the mercy of the VA when we are confined like I am and rely solely on the VA and I’ll tell you personally, it is a daily, stressful experience which no doubt will lead to further decline based solely on the stress and depression I stay in.\nLYING SACK OF SH-T!!! Fire our hospital staff,REMOVE benefit at 65 no MONEY F-CKED on Medicare!! F-CK YOU TRUMPF SUCKING TRAITOR!\nLOL, the VA can help with that anger management but your TDS is terminal.\nLeave Terry alone. This is not funny.\nT rump is a fraud and so are his programs. All you are doing is dismantling the government to give muskrat and his friends more freedom to rob us. The day when we get tired of this is coming and you need to think about where you stand (hint, long term vision is better than short term).\nI think the administration is doing exactly what we voted for.\nYou have my support. 100% service related, Vietnam\nThat’s a bunch of crap! He is in Trump and Musk’s pocket\nWhat about the1,000 VA support personnel that are being cut? How will that affect our medical benefits?\nJames H. Donahue\nCAPT, USCG (ret.)\nit would be nice to see full Dental Benefits for all veterans , not just retired!!! Dental health is probably more important than anything as far as sickness goes. not having to rely on anti-biotics and painkillers because of improper oral hygiene would be a great plus for our overall health. i could use dentures or implants and a few more extractions to get healthier and an improved digestive system because of being able to chew food properly!!\nSecretary Doug Collins keep protecting Veterans benefits. Even my family says President Trump is going to cut your disability benefits. I say no they aren’t going to be cut. Secretary Collins keep up the good work. Lets take the money for luxury hotels for illegal aliens and take care of homeless veterans. George Miller Vietnam Veteran.\nMy 76 year old Viet Nam veteran husband called the VA yesterday (02/19/2025) for an appointment with his primary care physician and the earliest appointment he can get is for 08/01/2025!! AND the VA Eye Clinic is closed and not taking appointments at this time…..if this guy is trying to tell you that things are fine at the VA and deserving veterans are getting efficient and quality care, he is dead wrong and many of these veterans will be also with this type of care provided to them!!\nMa’am, this exact reason you explained above, is why Community Care exists. I couldn’t get an eye exam either, so I received a referral to get one at a civilian clinic. Just ask for the referral, and if the VA tries to give you a hard time, stand your ground. Also, if your husband cannot get an appointment in a reasonable amount of time with his PCP, again, have his PCP get a referral for your husband to see a physician in the community. This is what community care is for.\nHi, Donna, we’re sorry to hear about your husband’s experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nIt is sad to see that a Christian Chaplin would align himself with the likes of trump. When you earned your master’s degree in divinity from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary you must have missed the day they taught Matthew 4:8-9. Because when trump offered “All these things I will give you” You choose to fall down and worship him (trump).\n“Again, the devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to Him, All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me.”\nI would love to be there on your judgement day and see you explain that decision you made to God.\nYou really should keep your political thoughts/feelings to yourself. “We the People” elected President Trump and he is doing “EXACTLY” what we asked him to do, like putting Doug Collins in as Sec of the Veterans Administration.\nsuck, suck, suck….taste good??\nIf there was a rumor going around my units that we were going to deploy, we deployed. I don’t know about everyone else, I just know what I know. Why would Veterans, Retirees and VA workers be on pins and needles for no reason. What about the “Women Clinics” closing due to DEI? Just our imagination? I’m going to wait and watch.\nIn fact doge is just a front for a fraudulent scheme and have illegally entered the government IT systems.\nA whole lot of worrying over nothing IMHO. DOGE, Musk and Trump do NOT want your money. They are not there copying all your info down (sheesh), ANYTHING to do with the VA is safe…including spouse stuff, etc. CALM down folks. STOP believing the lies.\nAnd to Richard L. That free time you speak of is due to your king sir..\nEither you are the VA website is a Liar ! The web page for Veterans announced at least 1000 people have Now Lost their Jobs but You sir Claimed No CUT BACKS have occurred!\nThank you so much. I am very apprciative of the work that DOGE is doing. It’s also reassuring to know that our benefits will be secure. Thank you, sir.\nI appreciated the video because it introduced me to the new Secretary. I appreciated Secretary Collins communicating his enthusiasm to take charge of the VA and his desire to allay the concerns of some Veterans. These concerns have been created because they have been duped in to believing what they read in newsprint and see on TV. It’s a significant challenge to educate them and build a confidence in the VA so they can know that the VA is getting its stuff together and can effectively help them get the help they need. Maintain the attack! VR–Leland Klein\nDear Mr. Secretary, how about dumping some of the crazy policies put in place last year under the previous administration, like child-proof hearing aid batteries! Sounds smart, but they’re Veteran Proof too!? Once opened, the VA provides pouches to store them in (not child-proof for sure! So, it makes it easier for a child to ingest a bunch of batteries, instead of one at a time! Please fix this & take a look at other things we deal with daily. You are much appreciated & I so appreciate you reaching out with the truth!\nHow can we trust that benefits will not be cut when DOGE shut down entire agencies without any evaluation of programs and mass firing without any justification, explaination or accountability? Yes, eliminating personnel reduces cost but has nothing to do with fraud, waste or abuse.\nI’m glad to hear that at least one part of the government isn’t being destroyed.\nSorry sir but the lies that have come out from the Republican administration do not give me comfort that your statement is truthful.\nDear Secretary McDonough,\nI am writing to bring to your immediate attention the unacceptable conditions at the Little Rock VA Medical Center. As someone who deeply values the well-being of our veterans, I am disturbed by the state of this facility and the substandard level of care being provided to those who have served our country.\nDuring recent visits, I have witnessed and received reports of the following issues:\nUnsanitary conditions, including dirty patient rooms, inadequate cleaning, and persistent maintenance problems.\nLong wait times for medical appointments and procedures, resulting in delayed treatment and worsening health conditions.\nStaffing shortages, leading to overworked healthcare providers and inadequate attention to patients.\nPoor facility conditions, including outdated equipment, broken infrastructure, and a general lack of upkeep.\nOur veterans deserve the highest standard of care, yet the conditions at this VA hospital suggest a failure to meet even basic medical and sanitary standards. I urge your office to take immediate action to investigate these concerns and implement necessary improvements.\nI respectfully request a formal response outlining what steps the VA will take to address these issues and ensure our veterans receive the dignified care they have earned. I am also willing to discuss this matter further and provide additional details as needed.\nThank you for your time and commitment to our nation’s veterans. I look forward to your prompt attention to this urgent matter..\nHi, Charles. Sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nThe truth and nothing but the truth with our Veterans, Thank you Doug Collins for being transparent with the lying media(Cnn,Msnbc,etc..)\nAmen to that\nTo see so many veterans, who are helping other veterans, be fired from the VA (especially those helping prevent suicide) is disgraceful. To see our country’s leaders spewing lies and abandoning our allies makes me sick. I joined the Cold War Army and served 32 years, and never thought to see us capitulate to despots and believe their lies and propaganda.\nIndividual ratings equal 120 % , yet my overall VA rating is 80%. Cannot work due to TBI, PTSD issues yet the VA cannot see unemployable as they themselves won’t hire me.\nDont give up… They (current administration) want you to, and are likely going to try to change the way the Disability Ratings are Calculated and Evaluated to reduce them and “Save Money”. 2016- 2020 was a awful period to try to get a fair disability review done.\nHave you gone through the VSO in your county or the VFW? Don’t go through the VA yourself when trying to get benefits. A VSO in your county is the best thing you can do to receive benefits owed.\nWhy are you allowing a non-appointed civilian into the VA at all and allowing the minions to look around at our personal information. President Elon Musk should not be allowed through the doors of the VA. He is an immigrant and does not have the authority to be in Federal Buildings without an escort of some kind and to think that you or anyone would allow a group of teenagers and 20 somethings with computers into the building and snoop through personal records is shameful. Resist the ELON.\nI sure need to get my widows benefits…my husband Wayne Mosby passed away 09/06/2023. I would appreciate your help. Thank You\nThe questions is: Are our benefits going to be taken away in accordance with the Project 2025 guidance related to VA?? recommend reading it…\nThank you Secretary Collins for the video.\nI appreciate you clearing up some of the liberal media lies.\nThank you for working so hard to protect our Veteran benefits.\nBTW, The President’s Executive orders have not trickled down to all VA facilities yet.\nI still see VA employees using gender pronouns and LGBTQ flags at VA clinics.\nAs a Veteran and VA employee, I truly appreciate all the hard work this administration is doing to protect and defend the rights of conservative Americans that solely seek to follow Biblical Beliefs, God’s beliefs.\nAgain, many thanks\nIt is a matter of trust. Doug you took the first step in gaining my trust. I look forward to hearing from you in the future.\nDear Honorable Sec, V. A., Doug Collins,\nAnother Combat Wounded Veteran (CWV), has died today. Some CWV’s will die, as a cause of caustic or failed V.A. Medical Services. Some CWV’s, will fall prey to SUICIDE, (due to the same reason cited in the previous sentence), “ADDED,”‘ by THE IMPACT of the voluminous FLAWS, FAILURES, DEVASTATIONS, DISRUPTIONS, HORRIBLE DISASTERS, INSULTS, and THREATS, to We the People, and especially to we military veterans, that was willfully created by the EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATIVE, & ADMINISTRATION OFFICES-circa 2021-2024. Most of which was to repeat, and employ the antagonistic mantra of the “EXECUTIVE OFFICE-circa 2009-2016, TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE AMERICA, from being OUR REPUBLIC, to a DESTRUCTIVE form of NWO-SOCIALISM.”\nThis depressed and overly stressed 80 y/o CWV (Vietnam 01/31/1968-@0200- TET’SURVIVER.), understands the opening paragraph WAS QUITE a RUN-ON SENTENCE…. but just the effort to cite a TRUTH … has given me calm, at least for the present moment. Though it is beyond any shadow of a doubt, that this CWV, has been the recipient of several VERY EGREDIOUS V. A. MEDICAL Services over the years, since I retied, relating to my never ending depression, dental, headaches, vision, and urinary tract V. A Medical Services, compound errors, that I must endure, as I am privileged, to survive with each new day my Creator THANKFULLY provides. Also with Gods love, mercy, forgiveness, direction and Guidance, to overcome my falling prey to suicide, while enduring so many emotional and destressing hardships, that has befallen on me over the years of writing that check, in Service to my Country.\nDoug Collins, Thank You for your service to Our Country, and I pray GOD SPEED your LEADERSHIP, Counsel, and CONSERNED DIRECTIONS to improve the present, V. A. Medical Services, especially to the many younger Veterans and CWV’s, that they will receive the best , and better, V. A. Medical Services, than was provided to us older CWV’s.\nHang in there young man, we are still above ground and for that we should be thankful. I am also a Vietnam Vet 66-67 SGT USMC with health issues related to my time in Vietnam, specifically tied to Agent Orange and I fight my health issues daily but I am thankful to God for he has kept me going all this time. I only started using the VA two years ago but they have been very helpful since I started using them. Hopefully Sec Collins will make the VA even better. You stay strong young man, you haven’t lived this long just to give up now. Thank you for your service and God Bless You. I will pray for you.\nI think we are going to be hurt financially and you know you are lying to us. Please stop telling people to tell us they thank us for our service this also hurts when it’s spoken with out sincerity\nOur concern is that the VA speeds up the approval for disability applicants\nF-ck your so full of bullsh-t Collins\nSure wish the VA would honor us vets that must keep medicare and supplemental medical insurance coverage. I pay over $450.a month for this as my two agent orange illnesses don’t rank me high enough for any none service related coverage. VA not honoring medicare is just a way for them to get more veteran at very low cost. Link up, please—-!!!\nI would have felt some belief in what you said if you hadn’t mentioned the draft dodging “orange felon” throughout your remarks\nI would like to know how hard are you going to get the Pact Act to cover burn pits for us Vietnam Vets? I would also like to know how hard you are going to push your former Representatives and Senators to pass the language correction initiative to the Pact Act, Section 804 being introduced this week by Representative Murphy and Senator Tillis?\nGreat.Democrat Media lies .\nSecretary Collins,\nAs a 2001 retired navy veteran, I want to thank you for the reassurance regarding veteran benefits.\nI am compelled to express concern on another matter, that being Elon Musk heading up DOGE. I consider it a conflict of interest for him to determine what is efficient use of my tax dollars while according to every source I read states he has to date received $18 billion tax dollars for SpaceX and Tesla.\nCould you look in to this or forward it to the appropriate government department please? Based on the various media sources I have read, it seems 47 (forgive the fact I have so little respect or value for him I refuse to even type his name) and Elon are collaborating on an agenda that is leading our nation to an end for democracy and towards a fascist state.\nThank you for your time and attention.\nIt’s about time that fraud and waste and silly DEI policies are rectified. Clearly instigators have to create false narratives to panic people.\nYou should know veterans fall under DEI as well. Diversity, Equality, Inclusion. That is why places are able to give “points” in the hiring process for Veterans.\nNot convinced. I predict that within six months we’ll see movement toward privatizing veteran’s healthcare or limiting it to combat vets.\nSince this guy is a trump appointee, I don’t believe a word he is saying. You said the magic word privatizing.\nSince you suffer from terminal TDS, I don’t believe a word you are saying. Sit back and immerse yourself in more Rachael Madcow, MSDNC, CNN, etc. Pathetic. Must really suck to have absolutely zero deductive reasoning. Hope you are able to reconnect to reality.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins\nI have listened to what you had to say and if you are truly ready to help Veterans then please contact me via the following email address. This address is one that I rarely use but I do check for answers to questions I submitted to other organizations.\nI am a veteran that has extreme difficulty getting around and I do need Community Care but currently the Northern California Health Care System could care less and in most cases have denied Community Care even though it was approved before. I do have Tri-Care For Life as part of my retirement benefits from the military and I have begun a transition back to Tri-Care to make sure I receive the care I need.\nAugustus, we’re sorry to hear about your experience. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nWe were lied to about Vietnam and have been lied to since about defoliants end results. Many of us have AO related problems that VA keeps denying after numerous claims we have put in…backed by DAV…I learned early on to never trust anything the govt. says…and I sure as heck don’t believe anything coming out of the White House, or Congress,anymore.\nWho are the DOGE people reviewing VA contracts and what expertise do they have in federal contract administration.\nWill the VA post the specific contracts being identified by DOGE for elimination or reduction.\nHow many VA personnel (federal employees) has DOGE identified that their positions are being eliminated and what services did these personnel provide.\nYour administration has promised transparency in these actions, and thus far I have seen none. Promises that VA benefits will not be impacted without evidence is poor assurance.\nYour effectiveness as an advocate for veterans is yet to be proven.\nNow let’s see if he means it or if he tells alternative facts/untruths.\nHe is full of sh-t.\nJust wait and see what Bone Spurs does to the VA. Already fired over 1000 workers in a time the VA is understaffed and trying to hire skilled workers. The closest thing that we see to a real Dr is a NP or a PA. And they don’t stay around for long . They are the real benefit we receive but if you can’t hire them or they are fired, we are f-cked. Which we are as of now.\nSo Doug, you just keep spewing the same sh-t that comes out of Bone Spurs and let’s just see how successful you really are.\nSay hello to Elon. That POS.\nPlease Please look into LOWERING COMMISSARY PRICES at Ft Bragg, NC…(other bases too) MANY of the grocery prices are higher than the civilians counterpart grocery stores. THEN on top of grocery prices…we pay an additional “6% building fee” which is a tax no matter what its called. The VA has so much buying power…seems the buying contracts need looking into.. Meat (beef)Prices are especially high.. At Ft Bragg/Camp Mackall we have so many Active duty soldier families & Veterans..there has to be a away to LOWER prices at commissaries across-the-board. Thanks for ALL that you are doing! :)\nJust curious then. If commissary prices are higher than grocery stores, why not go to the grocery stores? That’s what I’ve done whenever I lived near bases. Commissary prices are ALWAYS higher. Also, this man’s job is not in the scope of reducing grocery prices at the commissary. The commissary is under a different department. He’s in charge of the VA. Groceries have increased in all stores, commissary or not.\nI responded to my call of duty in 1967 spent 1 year carrying m60 machine gun in Viet Nam, paid my dues, just like thousands of veterans and a 100 % disabled, no draft dodger and or billionaire should have right to to attack military veterans who provided them the right and freedom they have enjoy today . keep veterans in your mind daily, not these idiots that that want to screw us and never served . Keep in mind veterans are going to stand up and for there right as this administration is mirror Russia more and more on a daily admiring Putin, pardon me if you voted for trump, but this is happing on your watch\nThis video is a shamefully political plug for Trump and DOGE. It begins typically by blaming the media for running with stories that they just aren’t commonly running that benefits will be cut. I read a wide range of mainstream media across the political spectrum on a daily basis and have not encountered a single story about veteran benefits being cut, but Secretary Collins probably found one somewhere. Collins doesn’t cite a single source or example and then builds a cringe-worthy political endorsement on a falsehood. Keep our military apolitical!\nWhat don’t our veterans need? They have sacrificed life and limb to fight our wars! What could possibly be cut back? How much is it going to cost for the cooperation of the VA. I am concerned to say the least.\nI am concerned that they may cut our DIC benefits. My husband did 2 tours in Vietnam, he wasn’t drafted and spent 20 yrs in the USMC and died of Agent Orange.\nTouching our DIC would impact so many families who sacrificed their loved ones.\nYou can cut the two employees that ask the Covid questions at the door of the clinic. There are more screeners than patients. That would save millions.\nNeed to look into the Biloxi/pensacola VA. they do not understand how Community care works! “8 months to get orthotics. Finally after sending an email I had a supervisor repsond and flat out tell me so many employee do not show up for work an when the do they don’t work. This awesome supervisor and transfering beause she can’t take the extra hours doing others work anymore\nHi, David, thanks for commenting. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411).\nThank goodness as my health care needs improved.\nI feel that we have to give up our benefits just to keep Trump happy. That is a no no, we did not volunteer to go to Vietnam in 1966, we were ordered to go and came back not the same. As secretary of Veterans Affairs are you representing the veterans to help them keep their benefits. There is going to be a lot of Veterans in an uproar and Marching on Capitol Hill. Trump can give up part of his pay since he is a veteran. You have veterans that can not work to pay their bills and and other necessities. Veterans work hard and came back injured and now we have a billionaire in white house giving advice to our so called Cammander in Chief , sticking his nose in our benefits we earned, they belong to us the veterans.\nTrump is NOT a veteran. In fact he used connections to dodge Vietnam.\nJust like Clinton avoided military service, just like Bush avoided military service, just like Biden dodged military service, etc, etc. Oh and by the way, President does NOT accept one penny of his salary as President. He donates it. The only president to ever do that.\nWell said!\nHe is also the only president who openly takes bribes – totally corrupt – hence the 34 felony convictions; wastes millions of $$ golfing more days than not, steals from charities, is notorious for never paying his bills, believes he is a king, calls Veterans ‘suckers & losers’, has total disdain for the military, lies about pretty much everything….. but sure, stay in the cult until he throws you under the bus because he will.\nVeteran, well said, Trump is a charlatan idiot and so are all his MAGA followers.\nSOMEONE SHOULD EVALUATE THE HOSPITAL IN DECATUR , GEORGIAN…THE FACILITY IS OLD AND FILTHY…THE TROOPS DESERVE BETTER…..\nThank you, VA Secretary Doug Collins! It is great to hear directly from you about what is the truth. I wish other Secretary’s would do the same. I am a 23 year Navy veteran and was less than a month from being cleared as Program Analyst probationary for the Federal Aviation Administration (Aviation Safety) and was just terminated last Feb 14, 2025.\nI am one of three who review and process the medical exams for the Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) here in the Pacific Northwest (we take care of seven states). Program Analysts along with the Flight Surgeons ensure that our ATC’s are medically qualified and we issue their medical clearances before they can control air traffic. Our job is critical as we protect the “safety of our national airspace”. Our Regional Flight Surgeon along with the Federal Air Surgeon is trying to get me back but they are not making any promises. In my opinion, it is about time that someone look into all the fraud, waste, and abuse in our government.\nPresident Trump and DOGE should have done things differently as far as letting people go. It is a long process to get hired for a federal position and then in a blink of an eye just get terminated. A blank statement of, “DOT FAA finds, that based on your performance you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the DOT FAA would be in the public interest” is totally inaccurate and contradictory to what was submitted to HR, “I certify that the performance, conduct, and general traits of character of this employee have been\nfound satisfactory and recommend that the employee be retained beyond the probationary period.”\nThere are a number of veterans who want to keep serving our government (single parent and those who moved to another state etc.) and at the end of the day, this is the thank you that we deserve? We the People…\nSir, I don’t believe that our VA is being served by the current occupant of Maralago and his henchmen scraping our data, destroying beloved institutions, leaving this once great land into some future serfdom.\nPlease reimplement customer service feedback for each VA encounter so veterans can address issues (good and bad) at the time of occurrence. An advocate should review these feedbacks and address, resolve, or elevate, any issues raised.\nAnd what of survivors benefits?\nSecretary Collins,\nWhile I understand that you are a political appointee, serving the men, women, and family’s of the US military veteran community and the Civil Servants who work for the VA must come first.\nThose members and families are from all walks of life. They come from every Political party. Every State. Every Religion. They may be Gay or straight. They may have voted for Trump. They may have voted for someone else.\nThe one and only thing that should concern you is taking care of them.\nYou talk as if the men and women of your Department are the enemy.\nYou pay homage to President Trump multiple times in this video.\nYou use propaganda and misdirection to avoid having to address and answer real and relevant questions.\nYou try to convince everyone that “The Washington media.” is at fault, that they are manipulating us, and that they are not to be trusted. You are spreading propaganda and stoking the fires of distrust.\n“They take a possibility, and then run with the story.”\nSo using your approach, if the media reported about the four 12 December, 2024 Proposals submitted to the CBO, about reducing, cutting, eliminating, means testing, and taxing our Disability Benefits, you would claim what?\nYou clearly make the claim that they should not report this information as a possibility.\nAnd yet they have been developed, written, and submitted for review to determine how much money could be eliminated from Disability Benefits, in order to fund “OTHER” budgetary priorities, such as pre planned tax cuts. These Tax cuts, as proposed, have been determined to disproportionately benefit the small percentage of U.S citizens in the upper echelons of income.\nBut you say that this “Possibility” should not be disclosed, or shared or reported.\nI find this greatly concerning.\nIn my humble opinion, you are coming across like a used Car Salesman, Yes Man, who lacks the courage and willpower to be anything but a placeholding marionette. Someone else controls the strings and the words that come out of your mouth.\nYou need to be a Leader worthy of the position you hold.\nI’ll believe this when I see it.\nI know for a fact that claims have not been moving faster. With the PACT Act there are more claims needing attention and VA was hiring but on a hiring freeze and looking to terminate those who were hired in the past two years. Stop lying to us..\nOverall my experience in scheduling an appointment has been from 1 to 10, I give it a 6.\nI have used the VA for the last 55 years and always had the same criticism. The telephone answering system where you are transferred from one extension to another showed a lack of caring:\nthe attitude is to transfer the call to someone else where you have to give the same personal information over and over again\nAlso, the specialty clinics are understaffed so the average wait time for an appointment is 3 weeks and up. meanwhile, the person is in pain.\nWell the people who work at the VA are on pins and needles day to day. Did you tell them what you just said in this video? They are waiting for the other shoe to drop. Musk and Trump both want to go after the VA. What about the one thousand people who were already let go?\nI see the hateful boomers are in full swing talking trash about our president. You can clearly see that they have way to much free time to watch cnn or any other main stream media like NPR. You folks need to get outside and pull the talking points that you regurgitate out of your behinds.\nGrow up, you are being spiteful and regurgitating lies.\nStop it.\nFocus on helping veterans and keep your gross political views to yourself.\nSF\nAre you a veteran? Are you concerned about your earned benefits? The current actions being taken by this administration are clearly evident as not in the best interests of the VA employees and the veterans. You better read the Project 2025 chapter on the VA and then wait and see what occurs. We have a right to be concerned about what is happening, Considering the Russian relationship and unqualified individuals being placed in the Cabinet positions. Currently serving Republican Congress are not doing their job, they need to go. The Constitution I swore to defend is under attack.\nyou are disrespectful….\nYou must be disillusioned and not able to think for yourself. Disrespectful is what is happening to our country right now. I am vewry concerned….Illegal access to the Treasury Dept. The firing of a person because they are in a 1 yr prob period. Calling himself “KING”. Individuals in Musks employment being placed in every Department to observe and report on activities. Ignoring the Constitution. Who knows how much of the peoples money DOGE employees will steal from the Treasure. The bottom line here is the VA is important to a lot of people and the benefits matter, so I have issue with ANYBODY trying to reduce them or take them away, You should to, IF you are a veteran.\nI am a Veteran, I am a employee of the Fed Gov, I am a retired Veteran. I am not foolish enough to hope that Trump is going to care about me or any benefits I have earned. I am not lazy, I am not stupid, I have put 40 years of Service into this country. Who are you??\nSecretary Collins,\nI appreciate you sharing this video. In the video, you mentioned there will be no cuts to benefits. So to clear it up for everyone reading the news, these comments, Project 2025, and Agenda 47, I have a few questions.\n1. Will Veterans who are or will be social security retirement age lose any of their service-connected benefits. There are different posts out there that reference portions of Project 2025 that calls for them to be reduced to 30% or lose 30% (go from like 100% to 70%)?\n2. Since DEI is being eliminated in the VA does this mean that women’s clinics and women specific doctors and procedures disappear from the VA Medical Center System?\n3. Will Veterans who receive military retirement and VA disability compensation be put back to a pre-2005 timeframe where you could not draw both at the same time?\n4. Will Veterans who can’t prove their injury was directly related to work while in the military not be afforded service-connected disability anymore?\nThe hypocrisy will kill you!\nSome Trump supporters are actually intelligent people. The problem is years of right wing propaganda have them brainwashed.\nPlease STOP with the political garbage on this site. That’s not what this site is for. I voted for President Trump and I am “NOT” brainwashed.\nMy disabilities total 130% but my benefit payment is 80% due to the VA convoluted combined ratings formula. Also my colon cancer is not an agent orange presumptive despite what the American Cancer Society says. Perhaps the new director could look into these anomalies.\nThe Bill above my comment is a different Bill than me.\nWHY does it take 25 years to get an answer about my claim and you say you are working quick\nI had no doubt that the Trump admin was going to take care of veterans and keep their promises. That phony media machine is incapable of telling the truth. It was under the first Trump admin that I finally got some of my benefits expedited. Everything has been on hold for the last four years and now the needle is moving again. Thank you Mr. Collins.\nShould we join the January 6 “patriots” and surround the DC pig pen and show our disappointment with the Trump musk man love team? Neither one wore fatigues for our great nation which is why they’re tearing it apart. Don’t drink the kool aid!\nNo, this time they wouldn’t label them “patriots.” You’d be thrown in jail as an “insurrectionist” or told to get a job.\nIt’s great that you are addressing concerns of many but don’t tell me that you are above trump/musk in making decisions that may affect many veterans. I wouldn’t believe anything these days because truth and integrity seems to have no place in government.\nWish the VA video was shareable!\nIs any of my personally identifiable information being shared with DOGE personnel? Will it ever be unsecured?\nThank you so much Secretary Collins for clarifying, although I’m not surprised. Thankful to have people in charge that care about us folk!\nwhy is the VA allowing a vender set up in the lobby of the Loma Linda California VA hospital and sell his wares of military hats, shirts license plates holders etc ALL MADE IN CHINA!!!!! as a Vietnam vet i find this very offensive. is this allowed in all VA hospitals??\nThank you, not knowing what the DOGE is or can do is confusing. Please continue to keep us informed.\nThank you for standing up for the veterans benefits and I wish you well as the Secretary of this department. We need a strong VA secretary.\nWe shall see. I have learned to not hold my breath, as it seems to be sucked out of me with every inspiration of a new president.\nyou have a very serious credibility problem\nIf you are cutting personnel you are cutting services. That’s all there is to it. The organization is already understaffed, just because it’s doing better doesn’t mean its up to snuff and removing human capital endangers the work already done. The people at DOGE know nothing about veterans, healthcare or our needs. Get them out and lead, don’t let them run some AI search and cut needed contracts because they trigger some 1984-esque word ban.\nYou’ve been there a week. Nothing you’ve done has impacted a veteran out here in the world. You may have a concept you think may work, but “clearing cases” absolutely is nothing you can take credit for. We don’t need that officer sunshine blown up our asses. We need results. Post another atta-boy-me when you’ve actually done something that shows you helped us. Cutting staff certainly isn’t going to get you there. Soon we’ll be back to 1 million backlogged compensation claims like it’s 2013 all over again. Freezing hiring won’t either, as the turn-over rate for the VA is high.\nI wanted to watch this video to see about potential cuts to my VA benefits, not to hear a speech about how wonderful donald Trump is. Stop the maga ra ra bullshit, you are suppose to represent ALL veterans, not just the ones who voted for trump, and Elon has no business looking at my imformation, period!\nJust entered VA Health Care system after retirement. VA care givers are pleasant to deal with but the VA system is not connected very well in my opinion. I only have Kaiser Health to compare it to. I have been chasing MRI/X-rays for both knees and legs for two months which was ordered by the surgeon in December and I have exhausted myself to the point of thinking about leaving the VA health and paying for part B Medicare. Anything outside of general care by primary doctor is a challenge with no follow up or phone calls on next steps. The only real help I have received to resolve my issues came from La Shawn at the Clinical contact center.\nis there any truth to the idea that for every 4 people leaving the VA ya’ll can only hire 1 replacement?? also , is the government trying to Privatize the VA???\nYou’re a rubber stamp for your one and true god TRUMP. You’re a disgrace to the humans you’ve served with and the ones who continue to serve in the US armed forces and the VA.\nYou cannot guarantee anything! We don’t believe you! You serve your god as a chaplain while simultaneously erasing humans careers, retirements, and the ability to live. Service to our country is a noble duty so many of us have all taken on, IT DOESN’T matter what you identify as. YOU HAVE A DUTY TO TAKE CARE OF OUR PEOPLE.\nI like Doug Collins! He’s on the same wavelength as President Trump! No nonsense, straight talk, an honest love for America…back to good old COMMON SENSE!\nLet me know how you feel about all that in a year.\nI have great hope and belief that President Trump and his administration, to care for all people.\nPlease explain why retired military (Veterans) lose their “Tricare 4 life” benefits if they do not pay into MEDICARE part B. If a veteran is 100% disabled, (service connected) why does he/she need MEDICARE?\nIf VA is the “primary provider” why do Veterans need Medicare B?\nI’ve performed a little research on Medicare Part B in comparison to Veterans healthcare, and Part B is required to be paid by a majority of others also obtaining other exquisite Government/Military benefits, with those individuals being pretty much ordered to pay.\nHowever, those separated are typically not ordered to pay into Medicare Part B. Reading in between the lines, if the boss of a company is not paying into it’s employees’ healthcare plan (eg. Medicare Part B), how can he/she legitimately supervise those below them for whom are (struggling/risking health and) paying into Medicare Part B. On the flip, maybe I’m just giving the system an excuse, but seems only logical as owners of companies can easily exploit the system, having the system paying for their everyday careless mistakes from subsequent employee health injuries.\nAlso noteworthy, keep an eye on something called guaranteed healthcare. VA healthcare is not guaranteed, to a certain extent, and can likely be cut at anytime, forcing the individuals back into the civilian Medicare healthcare whelm. I don’t like gambling, and guessing those at risk (eg. non-service connected) should probably sign-up with Medicare Part B.\nFunny thing, nobody preaches the above requisites. Obviously though, Medicare Part B is expensive for the vast majority, and it is sometimes a decision between food on the table and a roof over your head; with a hell of a lot of other people wanting and taking from you, whether time or money.\nWith Trump lying so much, I dont believe nothing. When you say resolve the VA claims, do you mean fairly or like with Ukraine?\nPlease dont touch the benefits I EARNED. They were NOT given to me.\nI have a case that has been at the board of of appeals since February 22 waiting to be heard by a Federal Judge with a case number that has not been heard yet. I am a 100% Veteran and I get the same ole story every time I call about it. My spouse is drawing aid and attendance for taking care of me now. What seems to be the problem just asking. It seems that to me that veterans are getting put on the back burner hoping we will die before anything is done and it is too late. Sir for so many years we gave everything for our country and now when we need help we can’t get it or those that work for VA think they are giving us something for free that have never served or sacrificed as we did.Sorry for the rant but that’s how mostly all of us Vets feel.\nI am a 23 year Vietnam Veteran, who has had his life shortened by doing the right thing for our country. I am 100% disabled due to Agent Orange, which was lied to us that it would not effect us in any way, thank you President Lyndon B. Johnson, a POS democrat. After reading some of the comments on this post, I am amazed at how out of touch so many of these vets are with reality. They say that their benefits have been cut, and they have under the Biden Administration. Trump in his first term extended benefits for us. He has been in office a whole 6 weeks, and has cut so much graf out of the tax payers budget, not the VA budget, and will cut more bulls##t out of the ash and trash that Biden introduced in his kickback schemes during his first four years. I am from a small Oklahoma town, and my small VA clinic has seen more improvements in the last two month than it has seen in the last four years. Calling Trump a lier and boggyman is so far from the truth, and as for GODE, Trump would have never introduced it if he didn’t think it would benefit the citizens of this United States. He sure as hell isn’t doing it for the money, he didn’t even accept one pay check the last time. I suggest that before you go around and bash the President, do your homework first. And yes I voted for him….. twice and I do not regret it. As for you nay sayers, get a grip, get a life.\nSPOT ON RUDY\nYOU ARE CORRECT! Thanks for your Service, Rudy!\nYou’re lying. Benefits might not get cut for now, but access to care will slow as workers are indiscriminately fired. Firing all probationary employees WILL leave a mark and since the Department of Gaslighting Everyone is rummaging around in data banks of sensitive information, it’s only a matter of time before some poorly supervised stooge steals it or leaves some back door to be exploited later when all the commotion is over. You’re not fooling anybody.\nStop watching MSNBC, Mr. Thorne.\nI was feeling pretty good until I saw the word “DOGE”. They do not do anything positive and are only out to destroy.\nWell, if you read Project 2025 and make it to page 646 there is a discussion of what to do about the budget. This section is heavily focused on cost-cutting and infrastructure reform and they call the existing VA Healthcare campuses unaffordable and inefficient. With that in mind they want to cut them and rely on Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs).\nSo, close the big campuses (hospitals).\nProject 2025 is about cost savings, not about improving your experience with something you earned by risking life and limb for your country.\nThank you for calling this out so clearly Jay. Project 2025 is no joke and calls out the “cost savings” that all Trump’s cronies envision. They tried to outsource and rely on Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) in the first term and are making a renewed effort to do it now.\nShifting our care to CBOCs means longer waits and receiving care from providers who often don’t understand the unique needs of Veterans. The time to write to your elected representatives is NOW, especially if you reside in a district that voted for Trump, to reach out to your Representative and Senators to let them know you do not want your benefits cut. You can find them here: https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative\nI’m glad you can fall into lockstep with your man fRump. Oh nevermind he has heel spurs so he can’t do anything anywhere near the military. I don’t think you have any idea what DOGE is doing especially in other locations. I hope you don’t F… up the veterans benefits but right now you can’t be trusted either.\nCollins is full of sh-t, like a typical MAGA f-cktard. He is part of the push to privatize the VA and sell it to Wall Street and Elon Musk. F-ck him, f-ck Musk, f-ck Trump. These scavengers are traitors.\nYou got that right Mr. Paul!\nReply-Russell It seems everyone on here is waiting.There is no need in being nasty, sounds like you are mad at the world. Mr Collins has only been in the job a week\nGold Star Wife\nIf you want to thank me for my service properly fund the VA Health Care System. Fill the medical staffing positions that have been cut. Take care of veterans. Meet your contractual obligations. Thank you.\nSec. Collins, I’m very excited to be working for the VA under your leadership. I should receive my start date this week. I’m a Master electrician in the state of Washington looking forward to applying my expertise at the Vancouver Washington campus. I’m also an Air Force veteran like yourself. Keep up the great work you’re achieving and thank you on behalf of all veterans.\nDon’t speak on my behalf. Stick your own head up his -ss if you want, but don’t drag me in there with you.\nDOGE is not part of our Congressional government. It was not officially authorized or funded by congress.\nVA has been short of people for a very long time, then we’re finally authorized to build their staff so more veterans could get help and quicker. Now these no nothings about VA health care come in and start down sizing.\nCollins is just another Trump minion doing what he’s told to do. Not a real LEADER for the VA. No substance to his video other than, just believe him.\nActuallly Tim, DOGE was started under Obama under a different name, the United States Digital Service. The more you know…\nHow do SES (Senior Executives) within the VA get their own flag? 90% of the work done at VA is by rank and file employees. I agreed w/ Trump when he said “drain the swamp.” Our Union (AFGE) agreed with him as well, however “the swamp” is at the top. I supported Trump up until Jan 6.\nSES employees at the top making $200,000.00 a year for doing nothing for Veterans at all. This was especially prevalent within the VBA (Veterans Benefits Administration) where managers (“coaches”) were sent to central office in DC just to screw the system up worse. I worked for VBA for 26 years. Here’s and idea for Elon/DOGE – put EVERY employee on production and have them account for their workday just like I had to for 20+ years.\nI trust this guy less than a second lieutenant with a map. Anyone believe this crap? Protect yourself and your family. Back up all your information and medical records. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins is a wrecking ball that doesn’t have the benefit of knowing what he is wrecking, and he doesn’t care about you or anyone else but trump.\nYou are obviously an American hating progressive communist.\nI work for the VA and can tell you they gutted a lot of Compensation depts to give to Contractors instead, contractors were never supposed to be doing the bulk of these exams. Now they get to make decisions no appeal, they make appointments for Veterans but don’t tell them and then say they never showed to the appointment. The project 2025 already said they were going to “look” at Benefits, you know what that means I don’t trust any thing this puppet says!\nSounds good, but how can you believe what any person trump appoints says. They are only saying what trump tells them to say, when trump’s actions indicate differently. A reduction in funding and removing 1000 employees can only increase wait times for appointments and treatments, adding to the workload of the already over worked and stressed VA staff. Upto now, at the VA hospital in Louisville kentucky, I have had excellent care and treatment with respect as a Veteran. I would hate to see the quality of care regress to what it was several years ago, when Veterans were not recieving timely care and would die. If this would happen, it would not the fault of the VA staff and employees, but trump’s and his appointments.\nThis does not address any transparency issues. This continues to devalue the role of news press, which is their role to inform the people of what our government is doing. I don’t see improvement in VA benefits, nor facilities. Your job is to ensure Veterans are getting the care they deserve based on their sacrifices for this Republic. They swore an oath to defend the constitution, not a king, nor his servants.\nGet up off your knees and raise your head. Praising a dictator is not in the job description of a VA Secretary. We’ve heard too many lies from the “king“ and his serfs. It’s not what you say, it’s what you do. We’ll be watching.\nUnfortunately this was posted as a reply… this is to the VA Secretary.\nBiden’s administration passed the PACT act and my local VA hospital was running smoothly and efficiently. At the time, I said that any vet who voted for, in Tammy Duckworth’s memorable nickname for him, “Cadet Bonespurs,” had to be insane. It turned out that more than 60% of you voted the for peabrain. You reap what you sow.\nRich, you cannot believe everything you hear on MSNBC. Set back and watch, see what President Trump does and THEN you can comment with some authority. “We the People” voted for President Trump and he is doing exactly what he said he would do, what “We the People” asked him to do. Why are you so upset, young man ? President Trump has only been in office for a few weeks, lets give him a chance before you condemn him.\nThank you for your service\nSemper Fi\nSGT USMC Vietnam Vet 66-67 100% disabled\nCommunity Care services is a absolute disaster , appointments on wrong g days and locations as well as no regard for patients available and made aware of at last minute !!!!\nDon’t believe them. President Musk & Trump are proven liars. Please remember the oath you took to protect our country’s vets.\nI was wounded twice in Vietnam, one sustained from a bouncing betty mine and one from an incoming mortar. Got neither purple heart, it’s been 58 years without benefits deserved, toughie shitski no?!!\nRespectfully, Secretary Doug Collins?! Do you really believe that anyone trust what you say in this video. You were appointed by a criminal, liar, cheater, stealer, and everything that goes against the core values on the US military. Your message is not very asurring and somewhat unprofessional when addressing the men, women and transgender community volunteers of our military forces. FAKE NEWS sir! You sound like a MAGA (not a republican) mouthpiece for a PODUS (the New King of the US) that should have been locked up and sentenced to jail, just like any other American in the US who has committed the same or like type crimes. Best wishes to you and a an empire that is getting ready to fall, just like the Romans did from greed, crimes against people, emperialist, and capitalism at the expense of tax payers dollars.\nRetired US Navy Officer, please take your Left wing political garbage somewhere else, it’s not wanted here. Not what this site is for.\nSGT USMC Vietnam Vet 66-67\nI don’t trust anyone appointed by trump, and that’s the way it is.\nI know it’s all made up by the media. You’re trump’s nominee so I don’t expect anything else from you. They will be making adjustments to the VA for “efficiency” This will change some benefits that Veterans receive and some of changes will not be in the best interest of Veterans. I hope you will make another video when these changes are implemented and explain why these changes are for the benefit to veterans. And by the way the administration stated they are using the 2025 Plan that most likely make changes for Veterans.\nI’ve had a claim pending since Oct, 2024. This guys is politician he is only telling what he is told to do to keep his job.\nGiven the fact that nobody knows what Doggy is doing and the capricious nature of this admin’s actions, I have no faith in anything that was said here. The US has a long history of screwing over veterans and this will be just another chapter in that book dating back to Washington and the first Congress denying promised pensions.\nI served 6 years, part of which was during war. I used my private insurance for my health care until after I retired . It would be good to realize that all of us veterans were trained to look out for those around us first and ourselves last. When I needed my VA benefits was when the cost of my regular healthcare threatened to take all of my substantial savings. I applied and was granted VA healthcare in recognition of my service. My medication bills went from over $1,800 per quarter to less than $100 for the same period. Keep in mind that many vets have always done what I did. We put off using our benefits until after we retired. That means the population of veterans who are being seen by the VA are more likely to have chronic diseases and need care for problems that require far more attention than the average American.\nThank-you President Trump and Secretary Collins! Most Veterans appreciate everything you’re doing.\nIf you don’t like what President Trump and DOGE are doing, it’s probably because you’re a recipient of the FRAUD, WASTE & ABUSE they are finding.\nNot hard to believe, you love trumps delusions. Sad part is his dislike for vets, especially those, who have been wounded. Cannot be seen in a parade, where the president may be seen in a photo. And to think he could not serve, due to his little toe problems. Stop with the false bullsh-t of expecting them to clean up the abuse issues. Lest we forget, the 4 trillion tax breaks for the Rich. I guess you would not mind giving, your\nretirement benefits to the cause? Would you? AJ Duke.\nSincerely Mr Collin’s (VA Secretary) with all due Respect…Congratulations on your Appointment of the Greatest most powerful Nation of Veterans in the World, but with that being said, We will hold you accountable & responsible for protecting our Benefits & Healthcare for all of This United States Veterans…Our livelihood & Healthcare depends on your commitment & Decisions as our VA Secretary ( Again the Greatest Veterans & Fighting Force in the World) DOGE Is only a Word to us Veterans & it should be to you also..Congratulations Again (Actions Speak Louder Than Words) Thank You & God Bless\nplease check my va-hotline message which explains in detail what change i feel should be made to help vets like that don’t want to be buried in a national cemetary. in my case i am 91 and already paid 11000.00 to prepare my remains to be burried next to my mother and father at a cemetary [ not va burial cemetary} and presently provisions othe than a upright stone and military ceremony are available to me . it is not fair i am sure there are many vets doing the same with no financial help..legislation should chang e to help vets like me doing the same expenses before they die. thank you peter pace\nGet up off your knees and raise your head.

I don’t think so.\nWhile I believe Secretary Collins that there are no Vet benefits being cut, I don’t believe much the rest of the BS he spouts. There have already been cuts to VA staff, including some who are Vets. Allowing Musk and his band of tech geniuses access to anything to do with the VA is ludicrous. I was on active duty in the Army from 3 May 1967 to 23 December 1970, which included two tours in Vietnam. While I was doing that, Trump was nursing his heel spurs and avoiding the Draft. Collins appears to have much more loyalty to Trump than to me and my Brother and Sister Vets.\nThe company that I work for does a lot of work at New York VA facilities. The waste I see is unbelievable, mostly due to laziness and lack of knowledge and using the system. I heard firsthand that two overhead garage doors had to be replaced at the facility. The facility super was given the task of getting a price. Several local contractors were asked for prices the best price was $18,000. Since the contractor was on the VA’S list of approved contractors, they had to go thru an already approved Veteran Contractor. The price turned out to be $32,000 dollar to do the same job. The contractor that showed up to do the job was the same contractor whose original price was $18,000. Waste at the VA.\nSo wastefulness from contractors and not the federal employees. That is what federal employees always say. Their hands are tied as to what to buy from whom and entering into contracts. But, will they actually deal with contracting fraud and abuse, of course not! That would be auditing accounts of big companies like Boeing and Space X all the way down to small companies like the one you mentioned.\nI am a VA patient with the Seattle VA Medical Center. I do not believe a thing coming from the mouth of a Trump appointee. DOGE is a hit job on the entire government by a non-elected, power-hungry oligarch. I will not be holding my breath for the “improvements” to care that this man describes. What I look forward to is a return to sanity in the federal government, a government not headed by a complete incompetent. In the interim, I will wait for the knock on my door from the goon squad.\nSpent 56 minutes on hold Tuesday for a 1 minute conversation to schedule annual eye exam.

Range of motion is not the “ONLY” way to determine one has lasting injuries just because it helps weed out claims so the government can turn their back on veterans. Thats one instance. Hearing loss – you put anyone in a soundproof box and then turn on sounds, of course you can hear them, but if your in the real world this doesn’t apply. In the real world so many other sounds are also going on that make hearing at a loss and not how we used to hear prior to military. Some age does apply and that could be taken into effect, but the current system is flawed. Only able to apply for one Mental issue? So if i have PTSd and also a mental aspect due to pain in another area, they cannot be applied together? sorry pick one. The whole program needs to be overhauled to help protect veterans. We waste a whole day for a simple dr visit if we go to the VA and the people working dont give 2 sh-ts about us. Then to get seen out in town by a truly qualified Dr not trying to just save a buck and push pills, well no way. Denied. or if on the choice program, We shouldn’t have to go get pre approval to see my choice if my out in town doctor determines i need treatment. How about if you get 12 visits to a chiro, but chiro says you need more. Denied. you should be fixed by now. Just ignore all future request that are sent in. Its a basic waste of resources and funds to keep the VA. Just give us the ability to go in town to our own choice of Doctor to be seen and get healed in our manner, Even if not the typical doctor pushing pills and its one that uses natural medicine or plant medicine to cure.\nThis man is a Trumper.

I have a disability case that as gone on for about 1 yr. I am now type 2 diabetes. This should be a slam dunk because of agent orange. The VA turned me down this first time. I appealed and they admitted their error and it’s still has not been resolved. This shows that cases are not getting done quickly.\nThey never have! They are understaffed and the Feds are not in the business to approve any case easily as the VA is the second highest spending in the government.\nWhen you allowed Musk (a fascist and Na–)-and his band of juvenile hackers, access to our VA data – you already betrayed the Veteran community. Your slick videos and worthless press releases will never gain you the credibility and respect that is essential to lead. Project 2025 targets Veterans benefits. We are not stupid -we can read. I suggest you reread your oath to the Constitution. As a Veteran, from a Family of Veterans – I cannot imagine why any sane person would support a convicted felon, rapist, draft dodger as our CIC. A person who has absolutely no respect or appreciation for service – and openly mocks disabled Veterans, will never, ever be worthy of respect. Do better.\nI felt like you were trying to sell me a car and slash the prices. And by the way DOGE is not an official department. All you idiots think that two billionaires care about low income and middle class workers. They are the reincarnation of capitalism and the abolishment of government. Guess what ?! The VA is government! Supported by federal money! You sir are completely unprofessional and your statement meant nothing. I hope for the Best Buy expect nothing but the worst from you and your dictators Elon and Trump.\nYou hit the nail on the head. Never buy a “car” or whatever else they are are sell. We are all doomed.\nI can tell that you are a Democrat and have very low IQ. It is your type of thinking that has almost destroyed this country. President Trump and Doug Collins are both working hard to save this country and the VA. Please move to Iran and talk bad about their leadership and see how long you will live.\nHere, Here. Agree whole heartedly. They are following project 2025 by the book, in case, well it seems that no-one has noticed. After, or once they finish, decimating the Pentagon and DOD. We are next. The DOGeS, have hip waiters on. And some teen hackers who know coding and computers real good will be barking down the doors of freedom and liberty, soon! We must unite, against this domestic enemy, and stand as one. Lets make noise and show what joke jr-6, was.\nFast talking used car salesman. Don’t buy into the lies. We’re screwed.\nWe had an oversite group in place with inspectors general for our government. I do not want DOGE who has no legal right to be in any VAs information or looking into how the VA is run. Get them out of our business, there is no way we really know what they are gathering and keeping. You say the savings will reinvested into bettering benefits, but there is no words to that or any guarantees from money hungry billionaires. Please put a stop to this invasion from DOGE. Your message did nothing but confirm how undercover they are invading our government agencies with no legitimate right.\nWaiting for 6,8,10 months for a benefits claim is not a good look for the VA. The backlog is not sustainable and very frustrate those in need. Let’s find solutions.\nFiring more people is definitely not the answer, when they are already understaffed.\nI’m thrilled and excited about President Trump and Doug Collins doing the right thing. I trust both and I know that they will Make America Great Again.\nThanks for your help.\nThank you Secretary Collins, for having our backs, for putting the truth out to the veteran community, for working hand-in-hand with the great work that DOGE is conducting, and for standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our Great President (President Trump)!!!\nYou are very much appreciated Mr. Collins and we are so grateful that you are our Secretary of Veteran Affairs!\nSincerely,\nB.K. Gilbert (Retired EOD Chief, USN)\nThank you, Mr. Secretary. Looking forward to the administration’s success!\nThis message seems to skirt around possible data breaches regarding veterans personal information. DOGE has already broken numerous laws and it’s difficult to imagine that an unelected immigrant from South Africa cares about Veterans personal information being compromised.\nVietnam vets were screwed during the Obama years. In 2019 the Blue Water Naval Act of 2019 was passed by Trump and immediately the VA improved. Trump was given an overwhelming mandate to turn around the mess the Zombie president has left us.\nThis video is well-timed and provides good reassurance. But, can we trust it? The tone was overly partisan toward the Trump administration instead of being a nonpartisan head of the VA, which is NOT a partisan subject.\nFor the record, it was Biden who got the PACT act through and never talked poorly about veteran status (like DJT talking about John McCain’s status).\n???????????????\nThank you and thank God for Trump and Elon Musk. I hope DOGE will fix the Biden problems at VA.\nAll the hate directed at Elon and Trump is hilarious. Clearly bots. None of them address REAL veteran concerns. Like the fact that we can’t even watch the video without a YouTube account. We can submit anything about our problems with the webservice because the pages don’t load. We can’t ever get directly in touch with our teams anymore, it’s all online, and as previously mentioned, the pages don’t load.

Don’t even try to argue that Trump/Musk/Project2025 and this congress is comparable to previous administrations. That s**t won’t fly. The average American voter is the dumbest (and most destructive) imbecile on the entire planet, bar none, with no idea what true patriotism is. It is they who are to blame, and it is they that must change their ways if our nation is to survive.\nWOW, right on the money. I could not have said it better. Thanks for speaking up. When do we march?\nYou are obviously an American hating progressive communist.\nI hope THEY are listening. Can’t believe grownups (MAGA GOP) are too scared to stand against tyranny, corruption, and now forsaking our allies for the war criminal Putin.\nOh my gosh, No Hope. Seek Help, SOON !\nHe talked but didn’t address concerns! The rumors are in Projection 2025! Firing Veterans from the Pentagon! I am sick of this.\nBenefits may not be getting cut but services are. The recent releasing of probationary positions as a RIF has very seriously impacted the Mental Services Department of the Danville IL VA. And now it will take months if not years to get positions filled again. Someone needs to rethink the hirring practices. It’s oudated and to slow. Veterans need better now, not in 6 months.\nI hope Director Collins is wise enough to reverse the firering in some areas and restore staffing before it’s too late.\nVeterans are depending on you.\nI, along with the rest of the veterans, will be holding you to this statement.\nIf this is a temporary distraction by you while they decide how they are going to dismantle our benefits, there will be a reckoning. You will have to explain why you did not protect and expand our benefits as you are now saying you will. Keep this in mind. We certainly will.\nYou don’t have to understand our lack of trust in this administration, you are tasked with building some level of trust in a country gone mad.\nBenefits should increase whenever they are supporting service connected health issues.\nI see all these negative comments about poor service and claims which have not been resolved for years, however, the criticism was never voiced during the past 4 years, during the Biden era. Did these cases suddenly occur now that President Trump is in office, or Mr. Collins coming onboard recently? My opinion is, those who are complaining are politically motivated and not a true measure of veterans nationwide. Regarding DOGE and Elon Musk, who was appointed by President Trump to oversee the waste and abuse of our tax dollars, why would anyone with common sense condemn such research? Should our billions in tax dollars be given away freely, with no accounting?\nBingo!! You hit the nail on the head…\nConsider the source – Just the “LEFT” being vocal with no substantial evidence of anything other than their own distorted view.\nBecause, like it or not, we got our benefits expanded under the last administration. You may hate Biden, but we weren’t being gutted like we were under the first Trump admin, and now they are accelerating the gutting process because they don’t care about veterans as much as they care about cutting costs for their Oligarch friends.\nBeing a Vietnam Veteran exposed to Agent Orange I’m experiencing medical problems for the pass 13 years. My private medical doctors say you can’t rule out that the cause wasn’t from agent orange, but of course the VA rejected my claim. But all the VA information says they don’t know the full scope of problems caused by Agent Orange.\nThe VA has been very good to me. I served my Country without any thought of a “payback “. However the GI bill helped with my advanced education, while the health care has helped me through serious issues.\nThank you President Trump and Director Collins. Remain vigilant and caring.\nYour video reminds me of a 1970s TV commercial by Ronco. “It slices! It dices!” Well it better not slice and dice my benefits. That includes the VA privatization scam from the Koch Brothers astroturfing “Concerned Veterans of America” and Heritage Foundation. And if I find out DOGE has been in my VA medical records, expect a HIPAA violation lawsuit.\nYou are not believable. Any one who has to disparage anything including the media to make your point holds no weight. I have been waiting ages for my disability rating to be increased and now I have to worry about the security of my VA data on top of all this. Praising DOGE and Trump is counter productive to all people with a brain. Results. We need results dumb videos.\nThank you Secretary Collins, we veterans are glad you ate leading the VA now. Please get rid of the woke crap that has poisoned are VA system. Under President Trump’s first term we were treated with respect and dignity. The last four years under O’Biden and Harris has been demeaning and difficult foe us veterans. We have had to deal with transgender staff, what pronouns do you go by signs, rainbow flags and safe space signs on the entry doors to the VA clinics and hospitals and ridiculous videos on the screens at the hospital and emails related to DEI and wokeism. They took all of the military related signs and information in the halls and replaced them with stupid unrelated so called artwork throughout the hospital. I mentioned it to the maintenance workers when they pulled the military stuff down and they said, “We don’t want too, but we were told we had to do it or lose our jobs.” Please bring back an American and Patriotic VA that respects our military and it’s veterans. I go to the Orlando, Florida, Lake Nona VA Hospital\nThank you sir,\nRespectfully,\nJohn Morris\nUSN American Patriot\nI read what you have experienced, not in my Community Based VA Clinic. In Arkansas. I was familiar with a Veteran Arts competition that was nation wide and regional. I think it was called creative arts something, I entered it and the Vets that submitted were given a show in Austin Tx, VA Hospital. The pictures, paintings and various art forms were from all Veterans-combat, Vietnam, Gulf War, Desert Storm (Mine). We got some certificates and a ribbon. So if you did not like the art work on the walls did you bother checking if was from some of your Patriot Brothers? Or do do you just like talking smack? And insulting us, Combat Vets, Retirees, Veterans and Brothers in Arms. Jerk-Off\nOh poor thing, how “difficult” it was for you to walk into a building and see a pride flag. How did you ever survive such horrible treatment? I sure hope you put a claim in for that.\nJust so you know, gay and transgender people exist, even in the military. And a real patriot serving in the military, a real leader, would fight for all and include all Americans who are willing to fight alongside you.\nGet over yourself.\nI believe nothing that comes out of these individuals mouths. You all are kowtowing to a psychopath. God help us all.\nDoug Collins is a slick talking trump appointee ie, a liar. If his mouth is moving, he is fibbing. I wouldn’t buy a used cat from the guy. DOGE is out to destroy the middle class. All the money taken from us, will be spent to continue tax cuts for Elon and the other ultra rich. If you believe otherwise, you are a gullible fool. This IS PROJECT 2025, and it’s only the beginning.\nWhy are we no longer being provided with eyeglasses? We are eligible for exams but not the actual pair of eyeglasses as we had received in the past.\nI have no benefits after my husbands Carlos death will this be changed at all he was 75 % disabled he went and fought in Korea ???Carlos Mann was an honorable man ??thank you Shirley Mann\nShirley you need to go to a local V.A. office and find out if you can get DIC payment for spouse.\nWelcome to the Veterans Team Sir, and as I know you all will continue to do great things to make the Veterans Services even greater. Me and my wife are retired Army Veterans and support the VA always.\nMr Secretary Collins, Welcome! I preface by reminding that my best VA experience was during Vet Friendly DJ Trump’s last term. After that came the purge, and change era. Veteran Benefit Cuts? That happened during the last 4 years (Biden), a purge of experienced doctors and nurses, replaced with inexperienced training less experienced. No one answers phones when you need, you leave a message and they call if, and when they want! The re vamped computer systems that are harder to use and deliver less Vet desired information? A joke! How much did that exercise cost? Who did that really benefit? Veterans clearing cases faster? Don’t be fooled CLEARING Claims is not a benefit to Vets Assisting to, and approving Claims is what benefits vets.\nThe media is part of the last administration, and will continue trying to misinform as always! DOGE? We should all WELCOME DOGE with open arms! President Trump has a track record of helping Military, and Vets at all levels, and it 110% transparent in his actions, which guarantees, All the money from waste found would be redirected to benefit the Veterans, not taken from them. DOGE will find if they HAVE BEEN stealing the money from you, as in the other departments of government.\nWelcome again Secretary Collins.\n4. End VA’s Individual Unemployability Payments to Disabled Veterans at the Full Retirement Age for Social Security: This option would take effect in January 2026.\nA) End IU payments to all veterans age 67 or older.\nB) End IU payments to all veterans age 67 or older who would begin receiving IU after December 2025.\nT he Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides disability compensation to veterans with medical conditions or injuries that were incurred or worsened during active-duty service. The amount of compensation depends on the severity of their disabilities (which are rated between zero and 100 percent) and other factors. In addition, VA may increase certain veterans’ disability compensation to the 100 percent level even though the department has not rated their service-connected disabilities at that level. To receive the resulting supplemental compensation, termed Individual Unemployability (IU) payments, disabled veterans must apply for the benefit and meet two criteria. First, they generally must have a disability rating between 60 percent and 90 percent. Second, VA must determine that the veterans cannot maintain “substantial gainful employment” because of the severity of a service-connected disability. Receipt of IU is not based on age, voluntary withdrawal from work, or other factors.\nThis option consists of two alternatives. Under the first, VA would stop making IU payments to veterans age 67 or older (the full retirement age for Social Security benefits for those born after 1959).\nThat restriction would apply to both current and prospective recipients.\nWhen veterans reached age 67, all VA disability payments would revert to the amount associated with the rated disability level; veterans age 67 or older who were already receiving IU payments would no longer receive them after the effective date of the option.\nUnder the second alternative, veterans who began receiving the IU supplement after December 2025 would no longer receive those payments once they reached age 67, and no new applicants age 67 or older would be eligible for IU benefits after that date.\nVeterans currently receiving IU payments who would reach age 67 or older after the effective date of the option would continue to collect the IU supplement.\n3. Introduce Means-Testing for Eligibility for VA’s Disability Compensation.\nVeterans with medical conditions or injuries that occurred or worsened during active-duty service may receive disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Payments are structured differently than other disability programs. VA’s disability payments are intended to compensate for the average earnings that veterans would be expected to lose given the severity of their service-connected medical conditions or injuries, whether or not a particular veteran’s condition reduced his or her earnings. Unlike disability programs such as Social Security Disability Insurance, payments are unaffected by a veteran’s earnings or other types of income.\nUnder this option, VA would means-test (that is, restrict full compensation to those with income below a certain amount) all current and prospective recipients of VA’s disability compensation.\nBeginning in January 2026, veterans with service-related disabilities and total household income below $135,000, excluding disability income from the VA, would receive full benefits.\nThat threshold corresponds to the 70th percentile of total household income in the United States in 2022, adjusted for inflation to reach the threshold value applicable to 2026 benefits.\nCBO estimates that nearly 30 percent of veterans receiving disability payments from VA will have household income above that threshold in 2026. (After 2026, that income threshold would rise with the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers.)\nAbove the threshold, benefits would be phased out at a constant rate: For every additional two dollars of gross household income, disability compensation would decrease by one dollar.\nPlease talk to the proposals submitted to the CBO December 12, 2024 that proposed in the future:\nDecember 12, 2024 Options for Reducing the Deficit: 2025 to 20342.\nNarrow Eligibility for VA’s Disability Compensation by Excluding Veterans With Low Disability Ratings – This option would take effect in\nJanuary 2026:\nA) Require disability ratings of 30 percent or higher for disability compensation for all veterans.\nB) Require disability ratings of 30 percent or higher for disability compensation for new applicants.\nVeterans with medical conditions or injuries that occurred or worsened during active-duty service may receive disability compensation from the\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\nThe amount of compensation depends on the severity of their disabilities (which are rated between zero and 100 percent) and other factors. By law,\nVA’s disability ratings (the basis for disability payments) are to be based, as far as practicable, on the average earnings that veterans would be expected\nto lose given the severity of their service-connected medical conditions or injuries.\nThose ratings do not depend on whether a particular veteran’s conditions reduce his or her earnings.\nUnder this option’s first alternative, VA would narrow eligibility for disability compensation by REQUIRING A DISABILITY RATING OF 30 PERCENT OR\nHIGHER FOR ALL VETERANS. AS A RESULT, SOME CURRENT RECIPIENTS WOULD NO LONGER RECIEVE BENEFITS.\nThe second alternative would require a 30 percent or higher disability rating only for new disability compensation applicants.\n(Current recipients would not be affected.) CBO estimates that in 2026, about 20 percent of veterans will have a disability rating below 30 percent.\nSee like a bunch of liberal hacks are on this page. The funny thing is they’re blaming Trump for their sh-tty medical care and other benefits. Uhm, nice try. He has only been in office a few weeks. Your sh-tty care was under Biden.\nAnd the congregation said AMEN…\nI have received the BEST care possible, for the past years. Several MAJOR surgeries. Jaw Joint Replaced, Neck Fusion, lower back fusion. No wait times. Biden brought us the PACT ACT.\nAmen to that !\nPlease talk to the proposals submitted to the CBO December 12, 2024 that proposed in the future:\nDecember 12, 2024 Options for Reducing the Deficit: 2025 to 2034\n1. Include VA’s Disability Payments in Taxable Income:\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides disability compensation to veterans with medical conditions or injuries that occurred or\nworsened during active-duty service. By law, VA’s disability ratings (the basis for disability payments) are to be based, as far as practicable,\non the average earnings that veterans would be expected to lose given the severity of their service-connected medical conditions or\ninjuries. Those ratings do not depend on whether a particular veteran’s conditions reduce that person’s earnings.\nDisability compensation is not means-tested, (restricted to those with income below a certain amount), and payments are exempt from income taxes.\nPayments are in the form of monthly annuities and typically continue until the beneficiary’s death.\nNote: See Proposed “Introduce Means-Testing for Eligibility for VA’s Disability Compensation.”\nThis option would include VA’s disability benefit payments in taxable income.\nDoug Collins also says he isn’t a huge bundle of sticks, so can he be trusted?\nLet’s make this country the best it can be. Thanks for being on the front lines for us veterans. My comrades deserve it!\nA statement that wasn’t a statement. Anything to support your troll of a king.\nhow about giving dental care?\nWhy can’t we get an insurance card and a list of Doctors to go to when we are sick or need a specialist. If your sick you have to drive down to the hospital ER. I recently tried to get an appointment with a dermatologist finally got one 3month out. I went to an outside Dr. for my condition. Tried to get help with community care. No help. Filed a formal complaint never heard anything.\nIt has been reported that the VA Crisis Hotline has been hit with staff firings. Is this true?\nBlaming it on the “press” is not going to cut it. Thousands of VA employees have all been let go. Any veteran will have his or her own personal story of observation. Collectively, veterans are heroes, survivors and fighters NOT “suckers and losers”. To have two non-veteran lackeys taking away our veteran rights is a travesty. Vets have to keep their opens open and stay strong!\nSlower than ever I put in a dependent change August 1, 2024 and still in received status. 7 months? Really ?\nArticle seems like a one sided snow job. You should already be doing what you say DOGE is doing. The military playing politics is how PUTIN works.\nI’m also have a claim on process for then three years and waiting.\nYou said: DOGE representatives at VA are reviewing contracts to ensure operations remain efficient and that resources are directed toward services for Veterans.\n1st – DOGE do not know what the hell they doing. No experience at all.\n2nd – YOU don’t have not experience SO that make YOU don’t know what the hell you are doing.\n3rd – That so call President NOT a president, HE IS A BULLY, LAIR MAN getting PAID for the future.\n4th – How dare you make a Video saying what this so called President NOT going to do. I bet you want tell him that in Front of his face.\n5th – To say more, why don’t you send this Video to the SO CALL PRESIDENT and have him to address it LIVE on TV so millions of voters can watch it.\n6th – To do MORE, why don’t you HIRE Veterans (Wives) to do what DOGE does know how to review contracts to ensure operations remain efficient and that resources are directed toward services for Veterans. VETERANS ARE THE ONLY ONES KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE NOT DOING. We as Veterans deserve better services.\n7th – STOP THE BULLS??T, and COME CLEAN BECAUSE GOD DOES NOT LIKE THE SMELL OF IT.\n8th – And the last thing- go back and listen to YOUR Video and tell me ONE thing you DID NOT say WHAT THE AMERICANS and VETERANS WANTS TO HEAR. This tells me you ARE NOT the Secretary of Veterans Affairs we are looking for.\n#“ DROP THE ? “\nFrom a Vietnam Vet: You do not speak for me. God bless and protect Trump from all his enemies foreign and domestic like you.\nNicely put. We think alike.\nDid you finish grade school ? This is NOT a political site so please take your Leftwing garbage somewhere else. I disagree with you completely.\nAs a veteran, I am truly grateful for the care and support I have received from the VA. From the moment I reached out for assistance, the staff was professional, compassionate, and committed to ensuring I had access to the benefits and services I needed.\nThe healthcare services have been excellent, with knowledgeable doctors and nurses who genuinely care about veterans’ well-being. Scheduling appointments has been straightforward, and the quality of care has exceeded my expectations. The benefits office has also been incredibly helpful in guiding me through the process, making it easy to understand my entitlements and how to access them.\nBeyond medical care, the VA provides invaluable resources for employment, education, and financial assistance, which have been instrumental in helping me transition successfully into civilian life. Their dedication to veterans is evident in every interaction, and I appreciate their continued efforts to improve and expand their services.\nI highly recommend the VA to fellow veterans seeking reliable healthcare and support. Their commitment to serving those who have served is truly commendable!\nFirst i trust the media and always have as secretary of the VA do the job for the veterans who made our country safe and not for DODGE TRUMP OR MUSK\nThank you Secretary Collins, we veterans are glad you are leading the VA now. Please get rid of the woke crap that has poisoned are VA system. Under President Trump’s first term we were treated with respect and dignity.

I go to the Orlando, Florida, Lake Nona VA Hospital\nThank you sir\nFaster than what? For fifty years I have sought the simplest of services, nothing. Last Jully I filed again, got diagnosed with PTSD, Chemical poisoning, hearing loss, etc etc. Still nothing. In fact, trying to trace my claim, it was sent to another office in another state just to be lost again. I’m tired of this crap. I don’t have that much time left on this earth and I’m stressing anymore over it.\nDear Sir\nI am a 90 year-old Navy Veteran with 32 years of Naval Service. In 1971, I was ordered to Viet Nam, where I was exposed to the Agent Orange defoliant and subsequently developed Prostate Cancer. I underwent a radical prostatectomy at Johns Hopkins, but developed complications that have left me unemployed since. Last September 2024, I filed a VA Form 21-8940 to apply for increased compensation based on unemployability. I have completed all the evidence , underwent a physical exam, but still awaiting to hear of any decision. I recently heard that President Trump was firing many VA employees and am wondering if he has fired those working on my case?\nSo thought I would ask you if this happened ?\nThanks for any help you can provide.\nSincerely\nRichard Mohr\nVA File Number [DELETED BY EDITOR. Do NOT publish your personal information on the internet.]\nIf quicker than ever how come I am still at Step 1, on a disability claim to add my wife, at 7 months with no movement? That’s 212 Days. I don’t believe any thing you said DOGE laid off crisis line personnel. After congress uproar. they are trying to get them back.\nI submitted online and my wife was added in less than a week. Maybe it’s your attitude.\nAre VA Employees being Threatened not to talk no whistleblower’s allowed\nSecretary Collins,\nThank you for helping put the rumors to rest. For the first time, I feel good about the VA and that the individuals who served their country are going to be getting the support they need and EARNED.\nThank you VA Secretary Collin’s and President Trump for your continued support for veterans.\nI am one of those Vietnam veterans who Trump called suckers. While he sat back and took his deferment for a painful bone spur. His support is non-existent except where it serves him.\nYes I agree. Claims are not being processed faster, slower by the day. I have a dependant claim for over a year now. Why? When all.it takes is to add my daughter back to my compensation claim.\nLIAR!LIAR!LIAR!\nComments being censored ?\nYes, they are.\nThanks, for the info, You have always done greatwork in Washington, welcome aboard,sir,\nVA Hospital needs central scheduling. Started to use the Durham VA medical and to make an appointment have to call the various clinics directly and leave a message and hope to get a return call in several weeks to schedule an appointment that could be months out. Crazy.\nWaiting moderation ? Is this sensorship ?\nIt’s censorship….but yes, that is what it is.\nCongratulation on your appointment,\nI just want to ask a quick question here. I recently broke off two front teeth right down to the gum line. I need implants that cost $10,000 .00 to repair this. My Dental insurance won’t cover it because they say that it is cosmetic. The VA only will cover up to $1000.00, and it has to be done by someone that excepts Veterans Choice coverage which will only be $1000.00. Is their anything I can do to get this fully covered by the VA? The VA tried to give me an implant on a molar a few years ago and they botched it. So I am going to Clear Choice Implant center to get this work done. I have only one shot at this and I need someone who does nothing but implants. I have a 100 % disability from the Vietnam War and I am struggling with Small B Cell Lymphoma from agent Orange exposure and medical bills are mounting up. Thank You for letting me contacting you.\nHi, Geno, thanks for commenting. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411)\nI was recently at the VA center in Hot Springs Arkansas and felt terrible about the way the older VETS were treated . I am 77and am lucky to have younger people to help me get to places like Hot Springs. this is a beautiful complex, proud of it. I was there for my eyesite exam. Older crippled vets had wives or friends pushed them inside. Once ‘inside’ they were told to go back out the door, take a left and walk back up a walkway to the end of the other building and look for a tent with their number on it and go in. This was done on the outside. Some Vets asked what was going on and were told where everyone could hear, that the other place had poor air quality had, not been repaired. This was over a year old they were told. Very sad.\nI am so thankful for our VA Services.\nThings do however take a long time. I have had a claim in for @ 6 months and no word on the status. So maybe more transparency on claims would be helpful.\nGod bless you, President Trump and the USA\nHi, Dan, thanks for commenting. We’ve submitted your comment to the appropriate office for potential assistance. In the meantime, please submit additional inquiries or issues to https://ask.va.gov/ or call 1-800-MyVA411 (800-698-2411)\nFaster than ever! Yeah right. Claim and reviews are taking longer than ever. Says 140 days. Some one is feeding mis information.\nAlso say you are improving taking care of vets. But what i see is a system designed to reject vets. For sure the vets that are getting older. You have vets that are young and only served two years being taken care of better than old vets that served 8 to 20 years.\nMaybe you can explain why staff at VA hospitals are being reduced! That’s a fact!\nThis happens quite often especially now that more veterans are opting for video or phone appointments. This also happens if the VA hired way more staff than what’s necessary.\nI would love VA’s dental plan to be expanded. I currently pay for the Met Life program offered by VA but am still unable to pay for dental treatments that are needed. The copays and out of pocket are still expensive.\nYou either lie or are naive. I no longer trust you or the government of the former United States.\nWe defended the United States yet you traded it for a red hat.\nYou’re not allowed to be surprised when programs and benefits are cut. This is what you wanted when YOU voted against democracy.\nI am not buying it. VA just fired my PCP that had only been on the job for a few months. Now I am without…again.\nI have been suffering from crippling asthma and constant shortness of breath since my deployments to the middle east where I sat on top of diesel generators, worked with asbestos, and inhaled gas and excrement fumes for months on end. The VA has been willing to prescribe me combivent respimat medication for COPD and Advair, but REFUSES to diagnose me with asthma and approve my 10% disability claim for 14 years. I have done everything I need to do after the passing of the PACT act. I am tired of suffering.\nSecretary Collins,\nI understand that outsourcing C&P exams takes in excess of 10 Billion dollars out of the Administrations’ budget. As a veteran subject to at least 15 of these outsourced exams I think it’s time to move these exams back into the VA medical facilities. While I understand that the exams were outsourced to provide timely care, they have turned into a money grab by the providers.\nMany of these exams are being administered by providers in small offices with questionable qualifications. They are more likely than not to deny a service connection lest they offend their cash cow.\nA lot of people don’t understand what is going on, the ruling wealthy class (top 1%) want to “Make America Great Again” by turning back the hands of time to the past, not the 1950’s as many believe (when the tax rate was 94% on the wealthy), but to the 1890’s, The Gilded Age (the time of the Robber Barons). For those that don’t know the real history of this time period: https://www.filmsforaction.org/watch/plutocracy/\nSo how did things get this bad that the ruling class could turn back time to a period in our history that was far worse for the working class? Brainwashing. The ruling class took the teachings of Edward Bernays (author of the book Propaganda), the nephew of Sigmund Freud, and have been using that to control the masses ever since. Bernays took his uncle’s work in the subconscious mind and perverted it into a means of controlling the masses.

I do not want DOGE who has no legal right to be in any VAs information or looking into how the VA is run. Get them out of our business, there is no way we really know what they are gathering and keeping. You say the savings will reinvested into bettering benefits, but there is no words to that or any guarantees from money hungry billionaires. Please put a stop to this invasion from DOGE. Your message did nothing but confirm how undercover they are invading our government agencies with no legitimate right.\nAbsolutely!!! I am a liberal–not a Democrat nor Republican, but someone who believes in freedom and human rights (equality for all people at every stage, income, race, creed, or religion) and I am horrified by how many veterans, people of faith, and those who claim to support the veterans can believe that this president is or ever was, an honest or honorably devoted servant of the people of this country or, and especially, its veterans. I am sick with grief over how the veterans are going to be treated by this administration.\nThey go on camera and feed us a line of BS thinking we will stay calm and forget our concerns. They have an agenda to gut social programs across the board, including VA benefits, to offset their funding of tax cuts for the uber wealthy plutocrats.\nWe elected the wrong people and now we will suffer the consequences.\nMost of us was mislead what the president said\nWe? You did, speak for yourself.\nTrump & Musk Are Lying and are Dangerously Taking Apart the Government to enrich themselves. Our Privacy Rights Have Been Violated.

Wake Up Veterans We have been Duped\nAmen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nNo offense, but any man who said that Veterans were suckers to go to Vietnam, who avoided doing his patriate duty because of a “bone spur” , attempted to overthrow the election results by sending his mop to the Capital then giving pardons to those who convicted and sentenced for that attach and is a convicted felony himself and not be trusted to protect the very vets he belittled.\nOH, yeah that’s the spirit.

Allah Akbar, er Praise God that is, Gulf War One flashback.\nThank you for informing that benefits will continue to stay sane for veterans that deserve them. It’s a great relief!\nIt would be nice to keep the same nurses and doctors for a while sir. The VA is a rotating door. It’s getting annoying to keep going through doctors etc.\nAlso you should have a public email for us to contact. Even if it’s through your staff.\nFill the 50,000 Unfilled jobs at the VA. Disabled Veterans Do Not Want the 2017 Mission Act To Privatize the Healthcare At The VA; It is Mistreating Veterans.

Trump Hates Veterans, Trump is A Vietnam War Draft Dodger who is only interested in his wealth And Riches.\nMajor Richards Star Act is a SHAM. Only officers who served in Vietnam were all declared 100% disable due to agent orange exposure. Even Navy officers on ships miles off shore. The VA transferred funds for the disability from the veterans retirement fund. These officers can now qualify for 100% free real estate taxes and other perks.\nThe rest of us who served in areas where the toxic chemical was sprayed get shunned or expelled by the VA hosp.\nI could go on and write a book. I’m OK with the VA treating us like dirt. I’m not OK with the 30-50 vets that commit suicide daily because of the VA.\nWe all know(veterans) that Doug Collins or any individual will not help any veteran or change any VA processes to better accommodate veterans at all. For decades, veterans have been s@&t upon with no changes. Everyone knows that federal workers are only there just to ride the taxpayer funded gravy train, do their time, retire and once again receive the taxpayer funded pension to live out their life very comfortably. All the while, veterans who fought for these people to have the lives that they do, get nothing much in return. It’s been that way forever and will not change, no matter who’s in charge of VA.\nIn 2016, I applied for VA healthcare and was denied based on my salary and the county (California)that I live in. Fast forward two years, I revisited that decision with a VA counselor. I was told by that counselor that I should have automatically been approved because of my time in Persian Gulf and Desert Storm. That’s a very simple example of how unorganized the VA is.\nI do have two claims that I’m waiting for a decision on, upon which I know VA will reject. Because that’s just what the VA does, deny, deny, deny.\nWhy isn’t Tinnitus considered an auto-grant for veterans with clear exposure to harmful noise. Tinnitus is a permanent condition, there is no cure, and severely impacts the lives of thousands of veterans that served this country faithfully. We don’t need more bombs, we don’t need doge, we don’t need controversy, what we need is better care for veterans.\nI agree, my disability claims have been resolved quickly, with the VA App I’ve watched them zoom through all 8 steps. My annual primary care visit was very pleasant, blessed to have a good doctor. I’m proud of the VA.\nI am a Vietnam veteran. I am addressing the facilities at Long Beach CA. This facility is huge. The first problem to address is parking!!! They need to build a large parking structure. The other problem is knowing where to go. It is just a large maze to wander around not only to find parking but also to find where to go and also to find your car.\nI go to Laguna Hills facility and it is in my opinion a great job done!\nThank You,\nCarl Jokinen US Coast Guard 1969-73\nPresident Elon just fired about 1,000 probationary employees just from the VA. That was a ‘media’ story. Are you saying that’s not true? And can’t all the stuff Elon is doing actually your job? Seems to me Elon is the republicans definition of a DEI hire. He’s an immigrant, on the autism spectrum, and 3 of his children have birthright citizenship.\nmr. collins.\nwhat about the 1000 workers that were recently let go that provided vets services? treatments for vets with cancer, respiratory problems, missing limbs, and opioid addiction. that move certainly backs up your comment about insuring care for vets.\nand allowing the richest man in the world to have access to VA information and suggest possible (dubious) ways to save money?\nmr. collins is an election denier, climate denier, once said democrats love terrorists, and has completely followed and supported trump\non every other major position.\nhere are a few suggestions for cutting government expenses…\nA Government Accountability Office report from 2019 said that four Trump trips to Mar-a-Lago totaled $13.6 million for the travel and security costs. If you do the math, that means Trump’s three trips to Mar-a-Lago in the first month of his second term tallied up to at least $10.2 million. Trump’s Super Bowl trip cost taxpayers at least $1 million just for the air travel and regular Secret Service detail that travels with the president. The field trip to the Daytona 500 event—where he stayed for roughly 90 minutes—likely cost taxpayers at least $373,000.\nThat’s based on the fact that it costs $177,843 per hour to operate Air Force One, according to information the outlet the War Zone obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request in 2022. White House pool reports said the flight times between Daytona and Mar-a-Lago were roughly an hour each, plus the daily cost of $17,520 for the Secret Service detail, per Snopes, and you land at the $373,000 figure.\nIn all, Trump’s travel during his first month in office cost taxpayers at least $11.4 million.\njust sayin’.\nit is apparent to me that mr. collins will do whatever president musk and vp trump tell him to do.\nplease, at least treat vets with some dignity and honesty and tell them what you plan to do so that we have some time to prepare and adjust.\nrichard isom\ndisabled veteran, usaf\nFAKE NEWS from another King Trump MAGA croney and not a trustworthy Republican! Seriously, Mr Doug Collins. You really expect us to believe this?\nThis is a lie! It took 7 years to finally get my disability benefits. Last August 2024 I finally was scheduled my exams which I completed and last month January 2025 I finally received my disability benefits! But three weeks later last Monday February 2025 I get a call to schedule all of the very same medical exams AGAIN only 6 months after I took them and three weeks AFTER I received my final disability adjudication!! Talk about a DOGE violation of waste of taxpayer money! Or the VA is trying to claw back my earned disability benefits as an EOD (bomb disposal) technician! So the VA IS trying to cut veterans benefits and my case, now on its 8th year is an example of Collins doing it! Next email is to my Congresswoman and news so they can monitor my case losing my benefits!\nCollins, you sound like a trump appointed political hack. I’ve already been affected. My medication refill was simply removed or disappeared. Appt scheduling is worse.\nSpeak the truth or don’t speak at all\nMy question is, why does the secretary need DOGE to show him how to be more efficient? Shouldn’t he already have measure’s in place for that?\nSo it’s the media’s fault. They are lying. I wish you would not have said that. That’s nothing but the same lame political propaganda this new administration peddles out there to the public. And right off the bat. I don’t expect problems to be resolved in 2 weeks, that ludicrous. Change must come from a thoughtful, meaningful process. Not politicized nor chaotic. Taking a sledge hammer to it will not work. Firing countless personnel who’ve worked diligently for years is plain stupidity. Now what? Start all over with who? The VA needs to hire more Doctors, period. It takes a long time to be seen and many facilities do not have the people required to care for our Veterans.\nMr. Collins I do agree with you, the media are panicking veterans that a cut in benefits is coming but is the opposite all is DOGE is doing cutting cost on contracts that are being overcharge at the VA, I myself work in the retail business for many years and profits was the number one, the federal government don’t worried about profits and their productivity is the lowest. I myself don’t see anything wrong for some one else outside the system to audit and see where the money is being expend so that more funds go back to veterans. Wish the best. Semper FI\nWhy can’t the VA do electronic billing?\nThere are many many vets that are computer savy and would gladly welcome e billing instead of getting a three page statement and an envelope. Each month. For a bill that they will pay through their bank.\nAll other businesses have e-billing.\nMr. Secretary, Thanks for the confidence that our administration is taking care of our veterans! Good to see such enthusiastic support!\nGood to hear.I worried that Musk would start taking benefits away.benefits we all fought for and our veterans need and deserve\nYou put out this comment after you already know that vets have lost their jobs at agencies all over the board. That includes vets at the suicide hotline. How dare you try to continue to lie directly in our faces.\nAttention VA Secretary Doug Collins\nCared for my nearly 103-year-old proud Navy Veteran Mother for many years and dealing with the VA constantly cutting her benefits was a nightmare! I along with my sister spent years and literally hundreds upon hundreds of hours on the phone with people who were so inept, uncaring and who were being paid to do nothing but refer you to office after office as your rode the VA UN-merry-go-round. At 80 the VA determined she needed 43 hours of care weekly and at 94 cut her to 20 hours-then 5 hours- and we had to fight to try and keep even that. Seven of those years were spent being hired as her caretaker which according to the VA rules had to be done through a VA recommended agency (what a nightmare they are). They came to our home once and never came again or did a single thing after that except force me to fill out reports they sent in to collect thousands and thousands of dollars which should have gone to the rooms my husband (also a Veteran) and I had to build on to our home for her care. Mom is gone now- It took well over a month for the agency who was supposed to be caring for her to realize this Veteran who served her country in Washington during WWII had passed away. My husband and I are still paying the price of neglect by the VA and so are thousands of other families. I think the company that the VA helped steal from my Mother and us should be held accountable to repay the money they stole into and account to care for Veterans. However, realizing the slim chance of that and still caring for our Veterans, as a long-time advocates, I would welcome the chance to talk with Doug Collins! Washington actually contacted us some years ago because we have developed programs, we were told by a government official under President Trump would save taxpayers BILLIONS of dollars annually – and we have had programs ready to be launched! We could have cut government expenditures years ago and turned billions being spent to care for all of our Veterans in excellence as well as providing them with permanent jobs but the swamp does need cleaning. Please encourage Elon Musk to DOGE the VA. I would welcome speaking with him as well. There is so much to be learned from those of us who have been through this first hand! We paid a high price and went through many years of valuable heartbreaking experiences to make life better for our Veterans and will continue to do so even though my husband is in his 80’s and I am in my 70’s. Please help our nation to avoid using inefficient programs and people and ask me how our heroic men and women in uniform (especially those who are now homeless) can be better served.\nSincerely, Naomi E. Rocheleau\nFunny thing to promise after 47 just made an executive order stating you’re not even in charge of your own agency.\nIf this is true why have DOGE and other representatives of the Administration already gone on record stating they have ran comparisons on Veterans who receive disability from VA to FAA licensed commercial Pilots? Shame on targeting those who protected us\nYour lips to Gods ear Mr Collin’s but with cuts for the sake of cut that seem to be the the intent of the new administration I am afraid for all Veterans and active service persons as this administrations first term there was no respect shown for military as we were considered suckers….I appreciate the work you do for us Mr Collins and your dedication to it, Thank you.\nHow about getting rid of DEI hires that are present in our Hospital admins. The care at the Des Moines VA Hospital has gotten worse since new admin people were appointed a few years ago. Why hasn’t the Hospital in Des Moines put up pictures of our new President and VP.\nDirector of Veterans Affairs Administration,\nI live in Houston, Texas. My husband comes to the VA for all his medical needs. I came to the VA with him and notice your photo was not on the walls anywhere in that government building. I notice President Donald Trump photo was not there either.\nThe person in charge needs to take charge and display your photo and the President of the United States on the wall. The workers here at the VA in the Micheal De Bakey building in Houston, Texas needs to step it up and stop being lazy and racist. Their service is terrible.\nI submitted a request to add a dependent (my wife) it’s been eight months. Your help in getting this resolved would be greatly appreciated.\nYour request to add or remove a dependent\nReceived on August 27, 2024\nAs if I believe one thing out of his mouth. His first point was not about veterans, it was about media. Pick on the media first. So, what agenda does that belie? Tell me how that helps veterans.\nI strongly suggest that anyone with problems get in touch with a veterans’ clinic in a law school. That was the route I took when no private lawyer would take the case of my husband. My husband’s case was taken by the clinic at the University of Baltimore School of Law.\nIn a time when we have no draft,the younger generation has no need to serve our country for the benefits that are being eroded away from this administration. We have a very limited force as it is .Those who chose to serve have seen their benefits being taken away one by one. I am a former Marine and a combat veteran of the Viet Nam war. The ones who served before me in the Korean War are also on the chopping block and for what reason? To satisfy the bottom line for some moron Senator who wants to study the rats mating skills? They have for a long time put foolish requests in the budget to satisfy some stupid agenda for their personal request.Taken away from the true needs of our country and the true honest Americans who have relied on their Senators to do the right thing for our country.We called them Ear marks and pork barrel request in the past. And each year they have continued to pop up at the tax payers expense.When are they going to come clean and truly get rid of them? Or get rid of the MORONS that request the stupid things that cost us taxpayers ??\nthanks to The Department of VA affairs and Doge and President Trump! the veterans need our support and the benefits we deserve!\nThanks for the info on what’s going on in the VA\nMr Collins,\nThank you for your video stating the facts. The VA has improved dramatically since I got back from Vietnam in 1970.\nPlease continue to help improve and retain the services we all need.\nSincerely, Don Foye USN\nHello Mr. Collins,\nI’m a Councilman in the City of Campbell, Ohio and I’m also Chair for Veterans Welfare Committee. Would it be possible for you or someone from your office call me at your convenience. Some of the constituents I represent are concerned about their benefits, with the recent changes going, the mix news, media and even this website. I too have questions. But mainly I want shut rumors that are going on, that I know are not true, but feel hearing it from you would make people feel better knowing you talked to me and I can get back to the people I represent and tell them everything is going to be OK. Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from soon. My office contact is 351 Tenny avenue, Campbell, OH 44405. 330-755-1663. Or you can email me\nThank you for the update!\nMr. Collins, because you were appointed by trump I can’t believe a word you just said in this video. You claim to support American military vets and praise so-called president trump who sucks up to putin, the communist who wants to fulfill Nikita Khrushchev’s promise to burry our grand children. American vets are going to get screwed over by trump just like everybody else. It saddens and worries me that the head of the VA will help trump do it.\nGreat presentation and thank you for all that you are doing for Veterans. The Administration is living up to promises.\nDoug, I have followed your career as a Congressman and since. I truly appreciate your contributions to our country. I am an 82 year old veteran as well as a Social Security recipient and Medicare patient (parts A, B and D), and I have a request and suggestion.\nWhile there are many good people in the VA Medical Service, getting care can be a nightmare and truly exasperating. Community Care service is obtained only after negotiating a labyrinth of call trees and waiting a long time for a call back. Community Care works great for me, only after I get through the VA part of the process. In addition, I get an annual VA physical as well as an annual Medicare physical exam. This is waste!\nWhy not eliminate the VA and let us get these and all VA services through Community Care by giving me a VA card that could be used just like I use my Medicare Card and my Medicare Parts B and D insurance cards (no going through a grueling VA approval process). It would provide us with the convenience of using nearby providers and eliminate the waste of having two systems, all while saving the taxpayers a lot of funding. Those VA employees who work hard could easily find work in this private sector scenario.\nThanks for listening.\nFAKE NEWS! Don’t let any person (croney) appointed by King Trump and his MAGA presidential cabinet (not republicans) fill your head with false truths. How can I believe anything a MAGA slave to the King says. We all know the PODUS is a lier, cheater, stealer, and most of a CONVICTED FELONIST. I served 20 years in the US military, and these are not the Core Values I was taught to lead our troops. Where is your HONOR, COURAGE, and COMMITMENT to the US military Mr. Doug Collins? You sold your soul to the antichrist – Donald J Trump! And what a very lame non-reasurring video message to post to our Country’s AD and RET military personnel. If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, then it is probably a DUCK!\nI wish they’d just let our president do his work and stop scaring people for no reason. The media is ridiculous! There’s no news reported any longer, just their opinion- and I didn’t ask for their opinion!\nWhy would we believe an appointee of Trump, the one who called veterans losers? Clearly in his revamping of our democracy, those losers don’t deserve any benefits any more than any other group he’s targeted. Although, he needs to keep the military alive and active for 1) ridding our country of all the criminal immigrants and, 2) defending against the coming coup to overthrow of his criminal administration (which cannot come soon enough).\nThis is the winter of our discontent. There is very little trust in the new administration. Defense is being cut and it appears Generals will be fired and replaced. Why would we expect the VA to be any different?\nVA Healthcare is under assault by those who wish to privatize it, i.e., to create another “public subsidy for private profit” system. The privatizers have one concern: maximize wealth and power, and have little to no concern for the health of veterans or the public. VA Healthcare works because the people involved are pursuing actions to help people while in the private sector the goal is to maximize profits.\nI should be able to contract the Secretary directly, I know he does not have time to read my email but he staff should, as a disabled Vet I should voice my concerns about the VA health care to him. The number one thing I have seen is VA employees that know matter how bad they are at their jobs cannot be fired, some of them are even promoted so someone else has to deal with them. thank you\nThank you Doug!! You are serving for all the right reasons!! SEMPER FI!!!\nWell as a daughter and wife of 100% disabled veterans I do hope we clean up the financial waste in this area so we can have more qualified doctors in our local areas so we don’t have to travel to baypines for certain illnesses. Hard to be driving around when you don’t feel well.\nMore concern to the veterans, doctors, and nurses.\nThank you Doug and good luck\nRemember these veterans did not say you have to wait when they were called why are they waiting now!!!\nPositive comment…I would like to volunteer to help Doug..I am a Vietnam Navy veteran, a retired Supply Chain Executive, father and grandfather…..I am serviced connected and in the system..\nThank you\nClean out the democRAT swamp scum. Faster, reliable, timely mail order prescription NO BROKE USPS! Fix website on myehealthyvet or get rid of it. Put Track prescriptions back on website. Re-Allow service from providers other than centrally located VA centers. Wider based, easier understood description and rationale for limits on certain disabilities. Cut the mountains of approval levels, Employ an easier self service application process for older Vet’s with lower computing skills.\nThank you . Your message was short and to the point. The main stream media is lying again. You getting the truth out to us is appreciated.\nPlease continue to share this message, as it may address concerns that some individuals have. Thanks for looking out for us vets. We need to stop the fear mongering-it will be all right, there is waste in any government organization, even in the VA-this disabled vet has had excellent service with the VA-again keep up the splendid work. Sorry for those that are having issues, I say that downsizing the VA will provide better service-it might be hard for some to believe, I have worked with organizations as a consultant in the private sector for 30 years which has proven to me that efficacy through streaming lining and UPGRADING TECHNOLGLY is the ticket-=the VA is no doubt using outdate technology.\nAnd to know those waiting on disability claims, it took six months for my disability claim to be approved, and I received my backpay for this two days sooner than was indicated on the letter so I can vouch that the VA is moving faster at this point in filling claims at least in my case\nWhy should any Veteran believe ANYTHING you SAY or PROMISE? You were appointed by a fairly elected sociopath who cannot be trusted by anyone in this world.\nAs a public servant you should not be criticizing our country’s free and open press whose diligent work has helped millions of Veterans. The press you criticize has always played a crucial role in raising awareness about the needs of veterans, particularly disabled veterans, by publishing stories about their struggles to reintegrate into civilian life, advocating for better government benefits, and highlighting the work of veterans organizations and pressuring policymakers to improve support systems for returning soldiers. Do a little history about the organization you claim to “lead”. This administration knows very little about true leadership, yourself included.\nVSO offices by appointment only with long wait times to get in still in Covid protocol. Administrative law judge hearings months to years waiting to hear cases. Veterans deserve better than this.\nLike a good puppet, you spew the same lies president Musk and his lapdog Donny vomit out of their mouths. When will anyone on the right in politics stand up to this poor excuse of an administration? The entire party is a disgrace with their lies and patronizing veterans.\nWhen Trump was president, the first time veterans had a paper which they could take to a pharmacy if they needed medication when their local clinic was closed and that was terminated under Biden as I tried to use it, and I was told it was no longer valid. It is extremely important to have that benefit because example I got out of the hospital on a Friday and let’s say the VA was closed and I couldn’t get the hospitals prescription written on a VA pad. I would have to wait all weekend until Monday to get antibiotics after coming out of the hospital for pneumonia. Please see what you can do to reinstate this benefit for veterans.\nYou can still use community care providers if your local VA is closed. I just used it this weekend. And the prescription service is still active too. I would call and speak with someone at the VA to receive clear guidance on this. There is a protocol for using the benefit. But that benefit is still available to Veterans. It was not discontinued under Biden.\nWhy comment? No one will pay attention or do a thing. I’m a disabled vet. Somewhere close to 90%. As I recall I was told I would have 100% coverage as a vet when I enlisted in the very early 70’s. I don’t have it and what I do have isn’t nothing to be excited about. Thanks to Republicans the promises made to me are just platitudes and we already went through the Republican version of efficiency once to get here. The VA is underfunded already and this DOGE bullsh-t is just another way of making cuts to the VA to help get tax cuts for the already wealthy. All we as vets are, are photo ops for the Fascist right wing and are expected to put our lives on the line for little to nothing in return because it might inconvenience the already wealthy if we’re treated like we were led to believe. I swore to protect the country against all enemies foreign and domestic and as far as I’m concerned Trump and the rest of the right wing are domestic enemies… Rest assured I’m not the only one to see that…\nDoug Collins already helped cut significant services and staff. I don’t see how we’re spinning it as a good thing. Dude is just another liar.\n60,000 square foot state of the art new facility in Zebulon, Ga. Only one primary care physician with months and months of waiting to get an appointment… help please. Thank-you.\nI should have been 100 % many years ago but have been denied over and over again. I was a combat engineer in an Atomic Demolition Munitions team 12E20 in Germany in 1966. I have had nightmares about setting off a device, killing people and team members ever since. I have PTSD Iand recognize it drove away my wife and daughter. The Army used agent purple in Germany and I have had. Many health issues. But the VA has said they didn’t have it. I have proof now I as a 79 year old reaching a point I may loose my house.\nCongratulations on your appointment. I am a supporter of DOGE. I have many thoughts on how to improve the VA and the Government, to many in fact to include here. So I guess my first recommendation would be to get rid of that ridiculous paper wasting survey and come up with well thought out questions and simplify. Last one I got I started and never finished because 1. the questions were ridiculously long and sometimes immaterial or the multiple choice answers were leading or misleading or didn’t reflect what I wanted to say. Anyway I trust you will do a good job and from what I remember about your background and time in congress you care about people and the county. There’s no doubt this department and the entire government can be better and efficient at the same time. Thank you and good luck.\nGo Secretary Collins\nThis VA leader is a boot licking Trump loyalist who has no business running this organization.\nTrumps only agenda is to sow as much chaos towards his perceived enemies as he can. That is not helpful for this country.\nTo point out the disinformation from Secretary Collins, any funds DOGE “saves” on contracts for veterans services will be used to partially offset the tax cut going mostly the very wealthy, like Musk. it’s not going to go to veterans.\nI agree VA staff has, when ever I needed to speak with them, has provided outstanding service. Although I do not use VA medical ( I have TRICARE for LIFE) I Saw the medical staff in action in Louiseville Ky. A friend needed emergency eye care. The staff stayed until we arrived and then made sure he received the treatment he needed.\nI am a Vietnam vet 1967-70 and I trust Doug and President Trump much more than those woke, inept progressive socialist democrats sucking our taxpayers money with fraud, waste and abuse. Dig in deep Collins and get rid of ineffective employees and bring back the competent and caring profesionals, di it Now.\nI’ve noticed that we have numerous comments by people with TDS or are simply the usual negative political hacks that simply enjoy complaining. Mr. Collins, I know you are a former USAF Colonel Chaplain and a man of God, and I wish you Godspeed as the Head of the VA. You will have a mighty task ahead of you to improve the socialized VA system. I certainly hope you can also streamline the Community Care system as well.\nTake care and God Bless!\nI would like to see my benefits reinstated I was dropped due to making too much income and i’m on SSA.\nI don’t trust Trump or any of the GOP members of Congress ! They have gone in a direction that takes all our fundamental ways of rights and freedoms away from the American people and put them in the hands of a egomaniac called Musk .\nSo the VA needs fewer nursing staff?\nhttps://news.va.gov/press-room/va-dismisses-more-than-1000-employees/\nI KNOW we need MORE hospital staff, not less.\n??HOW DID DOUG COLLINS GO FROM A VOICE IN THE RECENT PAST VOUING TO CLOSE ALL VA HOSPITALS??\nMy husband is a Coast Guard veteran. We thank you for this video. The media is into scare tactics. We appreciate the truth.\nMy husband of 26 years of military service was let-go. He only has 3 months to go to complete his non-probationary period. Other probationary folks are still in their jobs in the same agency. The dismissal letter said it has nothing to do with performance. Is this the response to veterans who were honorably discharged? Also, how is DOGE firing people? By draw lots? Kindly answer, Mr. Secretary.\nI’m not interested in “getting rid of things” at the VA, when we all know what you’re getting rid of is nurses. I’m not interested in your efforts to privatize the VA and its services, do not think we are fooled by your rhetoric around waiting times and service availability. Just fund the VA and give us staff for the clinics and hospitals. That’s the promise you made to your Veterans, and that’s the promise you’d better keep, because pissing off a population of Veterans is a bad idea.\nI respect the Secretary, and I believe him when he say’s our benefit’s will not be cut!!\nGood god why would we believe anything this administration says after yesterday when Trump spit on the graves of every service man who ever fought for the ideals that this country USED to represent!?! Trump just threw Ukraine under the bus and sided with a brutal dictator. All of you who support this traitor need to wake up.\nThis is how it starts….getting the vasoline ready…Jack booted thugs coming for you!\nWas the EO allowing VA health records to be sent to any requesting agency rescinded? I noticed this change when I was applying for homebound care benefits. I will not consent to my health records being sent to SS, IRS, and/or any agency that requests them, without notifying me or a having a warrant. Needless to say my application wasn’t accepted.\nThis is what they say right before they cut funding. Every. Single. Time.\nI doubt that . . .\nDisgusting mouthpiece of trump\nDOGE is a farce. Elon Musk and his youth tech hackers have no business in our veterans health care and benefits. That has been an ongoing process the past few years and it’s happening!\nThe VA has come a long way in taking care of us.\nDon’t let an unvetted, illegally appointee crush our vets.\nDOGE might not change our benefits much, but the staff won’t be available to carry out the mission to all of us veterans.\nSir,\nWhat is this I am hearing and reading about VA Disability Payments being reduced in 2026 based on the household income? Why cut what someone has earned?\nYea… They are processing claims Fast, Because they Just Deny Deny Deny !!!\nY’all think people who make decisions are even reading these comments.\nI called both of the Senators in my state and asked if the rumor were true that Veterans Preference was considered the same as DEI, they gave big big promises they would check and get back with me……crickets.\nI understand your fears and anxiety over our situation as veterans.\nBut I just don’t think Mr Collins has the slightest idea of what is written by us here and really doesn’t even care\nThis video is a joke. Let’s blame misinformation on the media not the source. This what we can expect from a secretary appointed by Trump.\nI have been turned down for service connecting disabilities since 2009. WHY BECAUSE VA HAS SAID MY PROBLEMS ARE FROM BEING OLD. I WAS A HAZARDOUS WASTE PERSON IN NAVY FOR YEARS WHILE IN\nI HANDLED SAME STUFF THAT BURN PIT PEOPLE DID. REXCEPT HUMAN WASTE. THIS IS BS. AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED THIS GOVERNMENT AND PAST CAN BURN DOWN.\nWhy is it so hard to get VA benefits for those who served in the mid-60s through the end of the 70s’.\nWell said Mr. Secretary. And Congratulations on your appointment as Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nRegardless, I truly believe by eliminating positions and most importantly eliminating Vets who work for the VA is not the right approach. A sledge hammer does not replace a scalpel. With a king in office who does not, and will never, respect the Military, all veterans should be cautious and concerned about the cuts to come.\nWe served the country, NOW, the country can serve US!!!\nThen explain to me why my appeal that I opened in October of 2022 is still not heard.? The system is broken and those vetabwho are waiting do not see an end of the road. Just more aggravation\nI believe in improving benefits and other things at the VA for us veterans, we all sacrificed alot to defend our country, freedoms, and the American people, we were promised to be taken care of after our military service, and there have been times when veterans had to fight for their benefit rights, and that should never happen not only did we sacrifice, but also our family members also sacrificed watching there loved deploy when we were in Iraq and Afghanistan, so improve the VA for all us veterans and do not take away from us who sacrificed for our country, as I am still fighting about being exposed to burn pits while on deployment, as well as a Desert Shield/ Storm veteran who was exposed to all that oil well smoke up in Kuwait\nWith Musk and Trump in charge i will take a wait and see .\nMr. Collins I have been fighting a losing uphill battle for almost 35 years. I was OTH Separated from the Army in 1991 as a matter of fact I was Deserted by my command. I still to this day do not understand why not one person has taken an interest and called for an investigation. I have done everything possible and I will never give up on my Innocence. Now that I am service connected disabled what is the VA going to do to help me get this set aside, and exhonrate me fully and bring relief and Justice to me and my Family? The worst part is no Courts seem to have Jurisdiction but they did not mind having me falsely arrested and held without any probable cause or mandatory 48 hr review, and sure as hell never mentioned administrative credit for that time. Why would they right all my due process, substantial, and constitutional rights are still being held hostage as POW’s. I have never in my a adult life been able to have my rights even restored to me what a shame. Maybe yourself and Mr. Trump s should DOGE a after the truth to recover Justice for me. You have the power to grant me Equitable Relief, I requested a such relief from the prior Secretary and even got an email stating give them 7 days to respond that was in N November, I’m s still waiting on that email.\nThank You\ni dont trust a word from any Trump rep — Trump is the biggest liar in the world. Russia invaded Ukraine, don’t let that liar make up new facts\nI am a four-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force, serving proudly its Security Service, from 1970 to 1974.\nI will speak frankly, sir. I don’t trust you. You are a Trumpist. You will follow whatever he says, for his good, not\nfor ours. You have, and will, bend the knee. I will not. I support democracy, liberty, our constitution, and our\ncommitment to our ideals and obligations. I support our allies. I am totally against oligarchs and dictators in the\nworld, and now, sadly, here at home. The oath I took is as meaningful to me today as it was when I took it 55 years ago.\nI SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WHAT HE AIS DOING TO CUT WASTE AND TO SUPORT OUR VETERANS WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY SCREAMING FOUL AT THE TOP OF THERE VOICES HE HAS TO BE DOING IT RITE.\nI have lived here in South Carolina for almost 7 years and I can tell you this, the VA has really stepped up to the plate. It started with President Trump during his first term as President, he replaced the secretary because he wasn’t doing his job and it took veterans forever to get care. Ever since then the VA has gotten so much better. The VA is a different place because of President Trump and the people he has put in place. My only hope is that the VA moves forward to keep making health care for veterans even better, please don’t cut services to save money. I am a patriot and I love this country, I fought for this country as my father did before me. Please take care of us.\nGet rid of the DOGE bros. ONLy way to have any credibility. These guys are amateurs.\nHow can we believe anything said by this administration about anything! We are abandoning our allies and doing Putin’s bidding. You are destroying America and your empty promises to protect veterans benefits is laughable while Elon Musk and his lieutenants are the one deciding things.\nThanks Doug, from a fellow Georgian and recipient of Vet benefits.\nI have been waiting 2yrs for an approval to my VA claim that the VA says is not service connected I was injured during field maneuvers in Germany and the injury is documented in my medical records, and I have been trying since 2017 to get the VA to see this injury in my medical records but they say it is not service connected.\nGreat hearing directly from the Secretary. No fake news from him!!\nSaying benefits won’t be cut is not nearly the same as saying disability payments won’t be cut or reduced. Please make another video that states disability payments won’t be cut or reduced.\nVeterans need to listen to the context of this message. It speaks volumes that no one’s comments have been addressed.\nPlease do not cut women’s services anymore than it has been in Florida. I can’t believe that my primary care physician has to be my gynecologist because that dept. was cut from the Jacksonville VA clinic.\nI already had to miss 5 months of mental healthcare because it was canceled for no reason other than I was seeing someone in the community instead of at the VA hospital. Now I have to start all over with someone new that I don’t trust who looks like she just graduated from college.\nIts good to hear from the top. The rumor mill can needlessly cause unnecessary anxiety. Thank you for the information.\nTom Bellows\nMy father was WWII veteran in Army Air Force. He pushed me to sign up with the VA after my enlistment was up and I had no idea the opportunities that became available to me. I served in the US Air Force to protect this nation and did it to the absolute best of my ability. No regrets. Proud now to be a veteran and I meet daily with veterans at the Montrose campus and we built a friendship that is beyond words. The VA is critical for veterans that gave their lives and I for one appreciate immensely all that it has given me personally. Please continue the work that the VA offers and always remember Freedom is not Free.\nAnother Leader in fairy tale land. They already cut 1000 employees. Yes, the ones that help veterans considering suicide. Why is so hard to find a real veteran to lead the Veterans Department? Got rid of judges. Reminds me of the veterans that died before they recognized agent orange did cause cancer. Old Bone Spurs is not our friend!\nthe proof is in the actions and not in his words that are unproven. I remember the former congressman from Georgia before he was placed in this position. He has made several mistruths in the public space in that later position and that was one of public trust as well. So I’m waiting to see if he is a man of his word or just an empty suit for the Doge stooges.\nOk I’m a U.S. Navy veteran who has had a claim for legitimate benefits that has passed the 3 year mark. Seems I got putting on the back burner. Would like to have a determination whether it be approved or denied. Just want to get it over with\nsocial security is not and should never be an item for discussion of cuts. its our money and congress should keep their grubby little hands off of it. Secondly, concerning a veterans disability compensation, should be provided a cost of living raise every year. In fact, we deserve more than what we are receiving now.\nWhat does Musk and his DOGE slash and burn team know or understand what Veterans have experienced or need to heal. Only Veterans understand what other veterans experience and need. You should hold the line and resist this attack on our government and support what we need. We have done what we were asked after volunteering to serve. Do not roll over to dictator in chief and his henchmen.\nConsidering the mount of damage DOGE has been doing to everything it touches, having mainly to do with the fact that Musk and his army of inexperienced interns have no idea what they’re doing, I have very little faith in ANYTHING being said here. Musk is an entitled rich doofus who has no idea the kinds of traumas and disabilities we veterans are dealing with, so he is a TERRIBLE arbitrator of what is and isn’t “fraud.” I’m tired of decisions about our care, and our benefits being made by entitled clowns who have never served a day in their pampered lives, or having some moronic DC talking head telling us that we are somehow leeches because we require assistance after our service. Like I said, I have no faith in DOGE, Musk, Trump, or Secretary Collins, and I do not believe that they will not slash our benefits.\nAre these individuals lawyers? Do they have significant legal experience? Have they been given backgrounds checks? Are they cleared by law enforcement to handle personal information and confidential documents? Is there accountability to those who are going over contracts? Or are we just expected to believe they are working in good faith? Lots of concerns.\nGood morning,\nI am a veteran (US Army)\nI filled out the form for my case since august 28th 2024 and still waiting. In today date february 20th 2025 I haven’t seen anything, more than 6 months.\nI hope they address the issue of the low pay for the VA workers and see that is why so many leave the VA. They need to Pay what the outside pays. I am not a VA Worker I am a Veteran who uses the VA\nHow about we cut-out putting Veterans into dangerous FDA/Pharma guinea-pig…I mean, clinical trials? I was a victim of said program that gave me a brief trip to the other side of the veil. That would the ceasing of Life functions by sketchy, dangerous untested drugs for all you naive types. While that was an experience, I never signed up for it.\nYou want to really help us veterans? Get rid of the WHOLE BODY RATING SYSTEM. Our percentage should be added up as a whole percentage and not reduced because of going over 100%. Make the 100% the maximum. I currently have 40,30,10,10,10= 70%. This is how the country I served for 21 years wants to short change me and every other veteran?\nEat s**t you Trump lackey scumbag. The only one lying here is y’all, not the media. Same old excuse.\nDo you really want us to believe that Trump — or any of his sycophants – have our concerns at heart? In 2018 / 2019 our town was taking up food contributions for the military personnel here because this guy executed the longest shutdown of the U.S. government in history because they wouldn’t fund his wall. This is the guy who dodged the draft by having Daddy get 2 doctors (who both rented apartments from him) to say he had a bone spur – which could have easily been corrected with an operation. this is the guy who had the nerve to call McCain a loser and denigrated the record of the late Republican senator on veterans affairs despite routinely appropriating one of McCain’s crowning achievements as his own. This is the guy who said when declining to go to a ceremony at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, near Paris, in 2018: ““Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” This is the guy who called the more than 1,800 Marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood “suckers” for getting killed. This is the guy who asked that wounded veterans be kept out of military parades. Just think about how many vets are losing their jobs right now, unable to make monthly payments, because of his executive orders and Co-President Musk’s DOGE cuts. This is the guy who is now posting on social media referring to himself as a king. Do you think he cares about us? You need to wake up and smell the roses – and stop trying to BS us. Like the entire congress, it is time for you to grow a set and stop lying. No job is worth your honor or integrity. JBK\nLet’s Do the VA Math Hustle\nVA disability ratings are based on “remaining ability,” not straightforward arithmetic. Here’s how the system works:\nA veteran is rated 50% disabled for PTSD, meaning he has 50% remaining ability. He also has Tinnitus, caused by severe hearing loss (HL) from exposure to helicopter rotors or jet engines. The VA rates the Tinnitus at 10% disabling but assigns 0% to HL, meaning it is acknowledged but not compensated.\nNow, does 50% + 10% = 60%? No.\nThe VA applies the 10% Tinnitus rating to the 50% remaining ability:\n10% of 50% = 5%. The VA rounds up, so he gets 10%, bringing him to 60% total disability.\nNow his HL worsens, and after a new audiology exam, the VA raises his HL rating to 10%. However, 10% of his remaining 40% ability = 4%, which the VA rounds down to 0%. His total rating remains at 60%—no increase despite documented worsening.\nThe PACT Act expands benefits for veterans exposed to toxins, including asbestos. The veteran has service-related asbestos exposure and is rated 10% disabled for it. Does this raise his total rating? No. The same VA math applies:\n10% of his remaining 40% = 4%, rounded down to 0%. He stays at 60%.\nYears later, anemia surfaces in his records, linked to asbestos, jet fuel, or firefighting foam. The VA acknowledges the nexus and grants another 10%. Again, 10% of the remaining 40% = 4%, rounded down to 0%. He still remains at 60%, despite multiple service-connected conditions.\nThe Real Cost of VA Math\nIf the VA used basic addition, his disabilities (50% PTSD + 10% Tinnitus + 10% HL + 10% asbestos exposure + 10% anemia) would add up to 100%, qualifying him for **$3,831.30 per month** in 2025. Instead, due to VA math, he remains at **60%, receiving only $1,395.93 per month**—less than half of what he should receive.\nEven worse, because the VA only compensates from the **date of claim**, this veteran loses decades of retroactive benefits for service-connected conditions that trace back to Desert Storm or Vietnam.\nThis is not a minor technicality. It is an institutionalized method of **Denying, Delaying, and Defending** against rightful compensation.\nEnough talk and start showing by doing what word came out of your mouth. I supposed when the PACT Act came out nothing really happened considering we have been suffering after Post 911 conditions. And with all the conditions I reported I only got 80% when it is suppose to be 100%.\nAs for education and training, there is much more to improved with helping Veterans domestically and internationally to allow Veterans to get full access if their education benefits unconditionally. Having credentials from higher institutions are not enough to get jobs that Veterans desire to do as their calling to find their new purpose in life. Do more and do better!!!\nRight off the bat we have a highly politicized attack on the press? This augurs badly. The LAST thing VA should be is partisan and trying to create a narrative to control perceptions.\nI’m a VA patient. Twenty years ago VA health care was really second rate and, so I avoided it at my expense. Over the last few years there has been obvious and substantial improvement. VA brought in much more competent primary care, expanded the quality and availability of specialty care and improved facilities. The most important thing was VA’s effort to recruit people, to upgrade staff. These people can make more money in the private sector but they choose to serve us because VA employment was more secure, more compatible with their family life, LESS bureaucratic than private insurers and because they have a more grateful base of patients at VA. Immediately upon jackass Musk’s shock and awe campaign a big chill went through, pending offers didn’t go out, applicants had second thoughts. The immediate damage will take time and effort to repair because confidence is important and the new administration has shattered confidence and trust.\nAnd what are you doing? What’s your first contact with us veterans? You are sending out political messages to attack the Press? If that’s what you think then volunteer to go on TV or give interviews to the Times and confront the press directly and see what they say in return.\nEven more chilling you want my name and e-mail. Anyone who’s been following events recognizes a vindictive streak in the new administration, I’m frankly concerned for my benefits because you seem to be “making a list”, here. But, damn it I’ve already seen a terrible change in morale and recruitment so I’ll take my chances.\nCan you help my husband a 30 yr vet ? He is trying to contact the Navy retirement office the other day they had him on hold for 3 hours then disconnected the call we can not get any help any where thank you for your service\nI’ve had a claim in since 1970 so I hope he doesn’t wait until I’m dead so that it goes away. Since I don’t know the claim number I know I can put my service number because that is public knowledge so here it is. The public is able to access this number and only access the number they can’t go any further but he can so you don’t have to delete this number. Thank you and have a wonderful day and may God bless.\n[Editor: Do NOT publish your sensitive personal information on the internet. I have deleted it from your comment.]\nApparently, Mr. Collins has not read Project 2025, nor is he aware that the VA OIG has been illegally fired. The VHPI”s take on the impact that the implementation of Project 2025 ‘policy’s’ is here: https://veteranspolicy.org/?s=project+2025\nWhat this adminIstration SAYS and what it DOES, will likely be different. DOGE may have already gained access to the VA computers. If their previous actions are an indication of their present actions, your privacy may have been compromised. DOGE was NOT supposed to gain access to CLASSIFIED data, yet managed to post it on its UNSECURED website.\nTRUST AND RESPECT IS EARNED, trust and respect can be burned with LIES. Veterans have a long history of DISTRUST of the VA for decades. The reason being – WE HAVE BEEN LIED TO, been disrespected, given the run around, delays, being treated as LESS THAN. Each new administration brings issues and policy changes. But WE ARE PEOPLE, not numbers, groups, things, actual living people who served our country with HONOR. When the time comes for our needs to be met, we cannot be assured of consistency of care. DOGE shows up and employees are told to go home, you’re fired. Did suicide hotline calls go unanswered?\nH.R. 5697 ACCESS ACT is described here: https://veteranspolicy.org/?s=ACCESS+ACT\nMr. Collins, your office sent me an email announcing your new position. I wrote back that I did not have faith in this administration to provide quality care/service. Nothing that you have said has changed my mind. I doubt that you will ever bother to read these comments posted by the very people that your department is meant TO SERVE. LIES HAVE CONSEQUENCES, FACTS STILL MATTER. Viet Nam Veterans said after they returned “NEVER AGAIN, NEVER AGAIN” They made it a point to ensure that Veterans were NEVER treated with disrespect, they way they were treated when they returned home. My family has had US military service members in every generation as far back as the Civil War. Generations of Veterans have experience with the government . This administration does not respect the military, nor Veterans. The man has profound issues with his own interests outweighing those of the country. I am not alone in reserving a wait and see attitude, as we have seen this clownish sh*t show rodeo before. When our government asked us to step up, WE DID, we demand that our government STEP UP FOR US, as we fulfilled our obligations completely. ALL GAVE SOME, SOME GAVE ALL. Our dues are paid in full, we expect to receive what was promised to us, when we raised our hands and swore under oath, to protect and serve the constitution, from ALL ENEMIES – FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC.\nTHE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION WAS NOT WRITTEN TO PROTECT CRIMINALS, IT WAS WRITTEN TO PROTECT THE GOVERNMENT FROM BECOMING CRIMINALS – Lenny Bruce, Veteran\nWell Doug you’ve got the easy part done now let’s see results.\nWhat about having to close all radiology at the Pueblo Colorado VA because everyone that could run the equipment were fired by Musk/Trump. Now thinking of sending people from other VA clinics for a few days a week to try to keep Pueblo open but cause shortages at other Colorado clinics/hospitals.\nI don’t believe a word he is saying. Muskrat and Project 2025 leader and head of OBM, have already said they want to cut disability payments once we enter retirement age.\nWhy can’t people see that this administration says what they think people want to hear. Then do what they want. All you have to do is watch and listen to them.\nCollins, from my home state, is as crooked as the day is long . He will do whatever Trump and muskrat tell him to do.\nI wish more folks would take a little time to just read Project 2025. It details Everything that this administration is doing. Even though Trump lied to voters by saying he knew nothing about it. Yea right. Tried to tell folks that he was lying.\nShameful.\nThey have sent Tens of Thousands of people to the unemployment line. Tariffs are causing prices to skyrocket. Every govt. agency is being led by appointees that have No Clue what they are doing. And they have already Fired Thousands of employees at the Dept. Of Veterans Affairs and Healthcare. At a time the Dept. is vastly undermanned.\n” Be careful what you ask for, you just might get it”!! And MAGA is getting just what they should have seen we would\nget. And what sux is, the rest of us will suffer for their uneducated voting practices.\nHope to God out Nation survives this Blatant move to Hitlers Fascism\nFIX Community Care. It sucks. Takes too long to set up and approve provider request.\nPlease consider increases to the spouse’s survivor benefits. It is impossible to make ends meet on the current amount. I’m so worried how I will survive if my husband passes before me. He has been 100 percent disabled for over 10 years and has suffered from his disability since 1971.\nHope your article is correct I have been waiting for a higher level review for 4 months, that’s just ridiculous. Been waiting on my C file just as long.\nThanks for the information. Sadly the media has lost all credibility with me. The one thing I cannot tolerate is a liar. As a former Sailor, liars can get you killed or seriously injured. These past 4 years the democrats and media has proven to me that they are liars. Once that bridge has been crossed with me, I will never trust that person or entity again. Never! Once a liar, always a liar.\nTrump lies every time he opens his mouth. How can we trust his “gofers”? As a disabled Navy\nVietnam vet (86 years old) I am scared I will lose my care giver, my VA meds , VA DR and housing.\nSay, could you be any further up T-Rumps behind? Sorry, I wish I could believe you but you basically addressed nothing in this video. It might as well been Donald himself rambling on saying nothing.\nPardon my skepticism, but quite frankly I have heard that all before, and to be completely honest our current (sic) commander-in-chief does not have a sterling reputation when it comes to honesty so I take everything he says with a large grain of salt. Nor, for that matter, do I place any trust in his chief minion, Elon Musk, who also has a track record for flights of hyperbolic fantasy when it comes to stating facts or telling the truth. As the old saw goes “The proof is in the pudding” and the veterans of this country will be watching closely and holding accountable this administration for honoring “The unwritten contract” that was implicitly guaranteed when we raised our right hands and swore an Oath that stated “ I, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.” It’s been 55 years since I swore that Oath, and I believe in it as strongly today as I did then and I believe that the overwhelming majority of our military, past and present, feel exactly the same way.\nI amma full timem teacer with 70% V Disabiity. How will then Fairess Act effect my benefits?\n“Hey y’all…it’s me again” … Great, a week on the job and already a total lack of professional bearing. Please spare me the Jerry Falwell bumpkin buddy chat…you are leading a massively important agency. Don’t try to sell me on what’s great for the VA and our current political administration is better than what’s right for the Veteran. The American tax payer understands with the utmost respect that these benefits are the price paid in keeping our enemies out of their backyards, continuing to give their children and grandchildren the freedom of choice and expression, and the ability to sleep soundly each night knowing we have/had the watch. God help you if you are knowingly being deceitful.\nYou are attacking the media for reporting what may happen? Isn’t it their job to keep us informed. So far it seems that our government is following the Project 2025 playbook fairly closely, and that does not bode well for veterans, or anyone who relies on their government to provide services.\nDear Sec Collins,\nI live in Jakarta, Indonesia, and I fall under your VA’s Foreign Medical Program (FMP) and I am APPALLED with the poor service that office has been providing.\nFor over a year, FMP has been delaying payment of over $50,000 that they own me and have not disputed, but because they cannot or will not move from paying by checks to paying by Electronic Transfer they are delaying the money they owe me to PREPAY the next phase of treatment, approved and authorized under the PACT ACT.\nI have even sent FMP the forms being used by the IRS, Social Security, and even some VA offices to switch from payment by check to payment by ETF.\nI have been working with my state Senator from Alaska, Dan Sullivan and state Representative from New Jersey, Ms. Mikie Sherril and they have made no discernible progress in addressing a major problem that should only take days to correct.\nThank you for looking into this and if you provide me with a name and email address, I will attach the documents I have been providing to the FMP and VA.gov for over a year now with no success.\nThank you!!\nDr. PDG, Jakarta, Indonesia\nI am a 78 year-old Vietnam vet (1st Cav Div) in-country 1968 to 1969 at Khe San and Phuoc Vinh. Honorable discharge and returned home in Aug 1969. I immediately went to the Winston-Salem,NC VA office and filed for disability due to Agent Orange (peripheral nephropathy), PTSD, Sleep Apnea, hypertension and a knee injured at Ft Bragg the medical staff recommended medical operation for torn ligaments in March 1968. I was given orders to Viet Nam for reporting in August 1969. After discharge in August 1969, returned home, with peripheral nephropathy (Agent Orange), Sleep Apnea (nightly rocket attacks at roughly 1:00 AM EVERY NIGHT and unable to go to sleep until the all-clear siren blew about 3:00 AM and having to wake every morning at roughly 6:AM every morning; PTSD(Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome); Hypertension (high blood pressure); being in I-Corps originally, roughly every other day for 6 months, you could count on a Agent Orange “shower” because we were in the tri-border area of Viet Nam, Laos and North Viet Nam.\nUpon my return to the States, I immediately went to the Winston-Salem, NC office to file for my education and disability benefits. I was given a paper claim card, which I still have, and given education benefits for school. My subsequent claim(s) was adjudicated that I did not have a claim because: (1) The lost my records because of a fire and the VA office; (2) there was no records that supported my claim regardless of the fact my DD-214 showed I was in Viet Nam and given a Bronze Star; (3) they had no record of my filing a claim and/or, I had not been stationed in Viet Nam; (4) All items claimed for disability were diagnosed by VA doctors on multiple occasions, yet the copies of records were in my records and the examiners told me that my DD-214 was invalid because it “appeared” to be invalid and I could not prove that I was ever in Viet Nam.\nI finally got approval for 30% disability, regardless of the fact that every visit to the VA hospital was met with the “stick test” that clearly showed that I had peripheral nephropathy; was given a sleep test for sleep apnea and given a machine for breathing help, and other medications for the items that are indicative of problems the VA found with those who were in-country and related to Agent Orange.\nI have been referred to outside consultants for Sleep Apnea, Peripheral Nephropathy, High Blood Pressure, given a cane for my knee. With these and other items found by VA doctors, I have been prescribed 17 different medications for the items diagnosed by the VA, yet, I was only given small compensation starting in 2011.\nI have more than 400 pages of medical records from the VA, which have been forwarded to the VA Records Collection in Janesville, WI. A recent inquiry concerning my records by the Dr working with my PTSD showed there were 2034 records in my file. The following week, I called Janesville and asked them about the disparity in the number of records, I was told they only have 434 VA medical records. The problem with the scenario is the record count is never consistent. I have only used the VA doctors for my military medical diagnosis, yet, there are occasions when their record count is zero.\nWhen asked about my claim, I was told they have made progress on my claim and the representative told me that I have a large amount of money due to their increasing my claim percentage with the implication being “I would need a large bank account” to hold the back pay I would get. To date, only my percentage has been increased effective December 1, 2024.\nIt is a constant fight to get this situation resolved, as in my case, 55 years with 4 conditions that is on the VA ‘s list of compensation is nothing more than an empty promise.\nI have tried the legislative approach, using my State and Federal House Members and Senators, to no avail.\nI haven’t seen anything in the media about benefit cuts, Sec Collins. Or is attacking the media part of your new job? What has been accurately reported is that 1,000 VA employees have been terminated – about which you say nothing.\nWhy do you trust DOGE to make wise decisions on VA contracts? They are led by a mad-man named Musk who is trying to reach reduction quotas for Trump’s tax cuts. I’m concerned – and you should be also. Or are you afraid to lose your job if you encourage caution?\nYour words are full of lies. I do not believe for one second you have veterans well being at stake. I’ve been lied to so many times by the VA and I’m supposed to take your word. Your word means nothing to me. Deceit and lies make up the VA and I have proof. You deny veterans benefits at a rate that is unacceptable. The VA denied my benefits for 11 years in hopes I would die. When I’m looking at my military health records stating I was injured while jumping outta planes for the 82nd Airborne and the VA was trying to convince me it never happened. When ask after 10 if I would like the VA to make the final determination or a judge I choose the judge. Exactly one month before seeing the judge the VA called me and said they would make an immediate decision within a day if I let them. My answer was no!!! I seen the judge one month later and it took the judge 13 minutes before deciding in my favor at 100% disabled. You act surprised when we have 23 veterans per day committing suicide. What do you think is happening? They lose all hope in providing their families with food and shelter. So I firmly believe half would not be committing suicide if given what was promised to them when signing the contract when entering the military. The VA administration is lying to all the veterans and denying them their benefits for as long as they can. You know this is true. Don’t sit behind your desk adding more lies.\nMr. Secretary,\nPres. Trump’s last term included an attempt to reduce social security benefits on a dollar per dollar basis for veterans IU. This is fact. DOGE is firing people with an hour notice of job loss. How can I be sure my Social Security and VA Disability will not be lost on less than an hour notice? Is there a public presidential promise? VA i s losing its employees by DOGE analysis, are VA employees going to face minimum employment loss notification or at least, a 2-week notice? I need to know the facts with proof, not possible hearsay by you or the ??? news. Please help us believe with proof, that our benefits for disability and social security will not be lost, like a public presidential promise on the news. I already illegally lost my military career on a on a Chap 61 by contractors, after serving 19 yrs, 4 mos, and 26 days and now I am not eligible for CRDP. CRDP requires 20 yrs of service. We need to know that our healthcare will not return to months long appointments like during the president’s last term. Please, we need the proof or what you say remains haunting. I cannot afford a loss of social security on a dollar for dollar basis. The President has demonstrated his disrespect for veterans the last term, publicly against Sen McCain for being an injured POW, from my state.\nPlease don’t permit retribution to our VA benefits for making a complaint.\nPlease read and reply to all the veteran statements sent to your office. Lack of responding will lead to a lack faith in you. Don’t let the news prove you wrong, present the verifiable facts.\nThank you for your service to OUR country.\nDLHJ\nSFC, USA (forced retired illegally)\nFeb 19, 2025\nThis is the “Thank you for you service” from Pearl Harbor Naval Base…..I booked and received confirmation at the Navy Lodge in Pearl Harbor Hawaii. My wife was with me on this trip of 4 days.\nMy flt arrived Honolulu at 7pm. We drove to the base so I can check-in at the lodge. The main gate sentry told me that my wife cannot enter without a pass and the pass office is already close. He told me I can access the base with my VHIC card due service connected imprinted on my card . I turned around and drove out to book a hotel downtown for one night. Next day I drove to the pass office and got a pass for my wife only to find out that it is only a one day pass for her and that I have\ngo back to the pass office every morning to renew her one day pass during our stay at the lodge. Talk with you counterpart Mr. Hegseth to see if wounded veterans/service connected veterans be treated with some kind of dignity and respect. Hell, Guam Naval Station excluded base access veterans from their Trusted Traveler Program.\nSecretary Collin’s, Thank you so much for clearing up the issue regarding benefits.. I am a 78 year old Vietnam Marine veteran who is suffering from prostate cancer due to my agent Orange exposure. I am hoping you can help me with a question I have. I submitted the information to the V A regarding some benefit issues.\nYou will always be in my prayers for the time I have left and I am hoping God will keep you safe and guide you in your decision making to help our country and our veterans. Thank you for reading this.\nThank you, Sir for prioritizing our Vets. It appears as though this page thread is being spammed by a lot of activists. God bless Trump and the U.S.A.\nHave you lost your ever-loving MINDS? They/We/Us put a EFFing TRAITOR in the White House as a MAKE-Shift POTUS. Once Trump and Elon figure out that the Military “WILL NOT” Shoot/Murder Brown Americans. Then you can KISS YOUR VA “BENEFITS” GOODBYE, via DOGE. World War II was never even close to the current THREAT that these Domestic Enemies BURNING this country down to the ground as WE WATCH. I spent over two decades serving the US Military and America. To watch a LIFE-LONG CON MAN destroy America before our own eyes. I am ASHAMED. Trump already “KILLED” three quarters of a million Americans by his INEPT INCOMPETENT COVID Response. That’s just a drop in the bucket for what will and is DESTROYING the CURRENT FECKLESS USA. – FOFO\nAnd DC, (something tells me ok to be up n friendly with you, Doug) I took a head Hit plate in skull etc. and helping at our VFW when able to AND just glad previous vets administration is Done (no comment – that was then, this is now)! Just many congratulations and anytime you are in SE Asia let’s have coffee together with ret.msgt Janet Cmndr. Luv it. Be safe my friend.\nDOGE is already cutting jobs at the VA. I feel I am being lied to by you. DOGE is cutting jobs and benefits to people all across the government. The GOP is going along with DOGE and is doing so in order to come up with money to give people like Elon Musk huge tax cuts. I do not like being lied to. I served my country in the war in Vietnam. I was an enlisted serviceman. Please do not give me a story about caring for the veteran when you are a part of Donald Trump’s ongoing effort to tear our government apart and run it like he is a mob boss. I am sick and tired of what is going on and will work with my Congressman and Senator to put a stop to this. How dare you put out a message like this and lie to the veterans.\nThank you so much for the update Sir.\nNice. Collins is a good man\nFirst – CONGRATULATIONS Truly. And thank YOU for sharing the Truth of Our Veterans Administration svc. as this cabal or d.s.enemy, “Fake News” as Pres Trump politely calls it… Trump’s America calls it ” The LIARs’ Media Lies-Guys who spread gossips harming Our soldiers AND their families… Just thank YOU very VERY much. Luv your initials: D. C., I forward “Our New Veterans Administration Boss, D. C. Doug Collins is guiding D. C. Washington to MAGA & HE Will. Just wait n see! “\nsickening – a south African born inherent racist proudly throwing N- salutes is digging though our VA system. My great Uncle, and WWII combat veteran, rest in peace, fought the fascist and N-s in Italy. He was captured and held prisoner til the end of the war. And here we are and republicans aren’t concerned about a ‘sieg heiling’ billionaire trying to defund our government agencies so he can loot a tax break for himself. I will NOT forget what my great uncle fought for and against –\nI don’t trust anything that the President says and I now don’t have any confidence in Collins. Let’s see some action, not words/\nCollins has a track record of being a Trump yes man. So it was disappointing, but not surprising, that he gets slotted to head the VA. Sadly, as we all know, Trump is a fake military man that steals valor from real Americans in order to project power. He would never put his life at risk for the betterment of the rest. The concept of service bewilders him, but not in a respectable way. Oh, no. Service and its accompanying risks are the plight of suckers. The military is nothing more than a bag of idiot toys to to do his bidding. This is what he had to say about fellow Republican John McCain and his military service that included 5.5 years in the Hanoi Hilton “He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured, okay? I hate to tell you.”\nBack to Collins, lack of qualifications aside, I was and could still be willing to give a fellow veteran a chance. He has been talking a big game about sticking up for us. But this video appears disingenuous and contrived. We are not stupid. That Collins is welcoming Big Balls and his band of tech kiddies to access our private information because it is all part of Trump’s puppet master’s plan to harvest every piece of data the administration is stupid enough to give them, tells me Collins is trending more toward lap dog than VA guard dog. Once the VA has been dismantled, funding won’t matter.\nAlso, DEI? Are you kidding? Our military and the VA are built on the backs of minorities. And the military is very good at producing disabled people, so it would seem fitting that the VA would be open to employing some vocational rehab or rehabbed folks. And give us a break on the LGBQ nonsense. I’m still waiting to hear of a legitimate instance where a service member’s or VA employee’s LGBQ status, on its own, impacted their ability to serve. Let’s try to focus on the real issues the VA faces that are obviously hindering its mission to provide veterans with the care and services they deserve and please stop wasting time fighting some made up war on wokism.\nAnother Trump shill making excuses for the cuts that have already happened. Notice the gaslighting in the phrase “media concerns”. No, they are our concerns. Trump is on record being anti-vet and anti social safety net. Musk is gutting everything to enrich himself. None of the 20 year old kids in DOGE are auditors. It’s only a matter of time.\nTime will tell if this actually means all veterans or just the straight white male types.\nHow can we be 100% sure? There is so many lies coming out of the current administration from an aircraft accident was caused by DEI to the the president of Ukraine started the war with Russia when the entire world saw the Russianv build up at the boarder and heard Russia say there were there just for an exercise, to the amount of deaths in the war and the amount of money that they have supposedly found that was fraud, to the administration cutting budget money that has been allocated any by law has to be sent for that allocation. I hope you are corrent in what you are saying, but please excuse me if I have a hard time believing anything this administration says.\nI find it extremely difficult to believe that anyone downstream of Trump is actually competent to do the job they are tasked with. Why, Trump has made it quite CLEAR he demands loyalty to himself above all others and their tasks. He has made it clear vets have little value to him through his many actions and quotes. Let’s see: demeaning Gold Star families, calling war dead “suckers and losers”, being a draft dodger himself etc. No one in his entire family has ever served either. Now we see first hand that VA systems are LOSING staff when most of the facilities are already understaffed. So how does this work to improve the VA serviced to the veteran community, of which I am a member? Sec Collin’s, I have No trust or confidence when it comes to Trumps action or word. He has proven his word means little. So, from that alone, i do not see good things in store for the current VA system. Not improvements, better budget perhaps, no I see the goal of privatization in the future. For the benefit of his wealthy handlers.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins, Spineless Sycophant\nI am so so pleased that Doug Collins is in charge of the VA now. I am hopeful that things will be run more efficiently to the benefit of the veterans it cares for. Is there a way to get a letter to Secretary Collins through regular mail?\nPlease add a Bluesky link for ‘Share this story.’ Thank you.\nThis guy doesn’t realize what a fool he looks like, waving his arms, flapping his gums and using the pathetic fall-back “media’s doing it” BS. Please talk to Veterans like a human, not a tool. Do you think we’re children? “Don’t worry, nobody’s taking away your benefits!” You moron! When you make it so there’s not enough workers to handle the workload of helping Veterans get their promised health care, that’s denying Veterans their benefits. When a Veteran spends the better part of their days trying to make contact with the VA health system for an appointment that’s a denial of benefits. If enough of us Veterans simply give up trying to access benefits, that’s fewer Veterans to have to spend money on. I know I’m not expressing it well, but I won’t be around too much longer so the trillionaires can keep whatever extra pennies they would have had to pay out for whatever medical care I’d be needing.\nU lying for musk and his VP trump\nSecretary Collins, I want to draw your attention to the incredible VAMC, Boston, MA staff. I have never experienced such professional excellence, administrative genius, and remarkable decency as I have at this location. Best regards, J.L. Ross, MD [retired, US Navy]\nWAS HOPING FOR GOOD CHANGES FOR THE FUTURE OF THE VA FROM HEARING ABOUT YOUR CONFIMATION. I VISIT THE VA HERE IN OKLAHOMA. WE HAVE A CENTRALIZED PHONE SYSTEM FOR THEM HERE AND IT TAKES US TO AN OPERATOR AND THEN TO ANOTHER OPERATOR, THEN TO ANOTHER OPERATOR. FINALLY GET A HUMAN ON THE PHONE ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THEY SENT YOU TO THE WRONG DEPARTMENT. BEFORE 2024, I COULD CALL THE CLINIC AND TALK TO A HUMAN. IF YOU HAD TO RUN YOUR OFFICE WITH A PHONE SYSTEM LIKE THIS, THAT WOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF IN A HEARTBEAT! TAKE ABOUT 6 WEEKS TO GET AN APPOINTMENT. THEN XRAYS , THEN MRI ANOTHER 6 WEEKS, THEN YOUR PRIMARY IS GONE AND REPLACED WITH A PA. WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU FIXING SIR. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR MISSION STATEMENT FOR THE VA, BECAUSE NONE OF THE POSTED ARE ADHERED TO. THANK YOU\nSorry I don’t find this all that believable. We shall see I suppose who is telling the truth and what is hypothetical. I don’t see the President having much respect for veterans or for military service but that is only my opinion based on his past comments and actions. DOGE is a new government bureuocracy already given too much power and too little oversight. I think as veterans receiving VA benefits we have a right to be concerned about the intentions of this new administration.\nI am losing faith in the country that I served proudly. Actually, not faith in the country, but any faith or respect for it’s current leadership. I cannot understand how our Senators and Representatives, who in theory work for us, can stand by and watch this country become smaller and less of a source for powerful good on this planet. They now stand by and watch an administration rape and pillage the good will we had in the world. They watch as the adminstration disrespects the countries that have had our back, and show favor to those who mean us harm. At the same time these “lawmakers” allow disrespectful (dare I say illegal) access to the institutions of government and those that serve there. Should there be changes, and is there problems, you bet. But using a sledge hammer is sure as hell not the proper way for sensible people to address these issues. Way to indescrimate. It will be interesting when the sledge hammer hits the VA. I pray we as veterans survive this senseless and brainless rampage. Think “Kristallnacht”.\nI don’t believe this is true DOGE is gutting every agency why not VA and there is no evidence that what they are saying is true. I believe we Vets are about to get screwed again.\nThis sounds like a political propaganda video. There are cuts being made and many veterans that work for the VA have lost their jobs. How does this help ALL of our veterans. I am thankful for being a veteran and for everything the VA has done for me but when someone has to create a video praising our first felon President and a new program (DOGE) that was created by this corrupt President gives me pause.\nThank you, Secretary Collins.\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) improperly awarded $10.8 million in bonuses to senior executives using funds from the PACT Act. The money was intended to retain employees in understaffed positions.\nExplanation\nThe PACT Act expanded health care and benefits for veterans exposed to environmental toxins.\nThe VA Secretary could award up to 25% of an employee’s basic pay as a Critical Skills Incentive (CSI).\nThe VA’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that the money was given to senior executives in the VA Central Office in Washington, DC.\nThe OIG report found that seven executives in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) received bonuses of more than $100,000.\nI will have my lawyer contact you since I still have cases pending.\nI am not a firm believer in the lies the politicians, news media, and just anybody speaking is saying. I depend on this money to survive, and I am concerned about what a nonelected official does with my income and the nation’s money.\nMy lawyer info:\nTravis Neidig\nI actually copied this from a previous comment to save me time, as I am a 100% disabled veteran who served in Desert Storm, Desert Shield, and left the military at the end of Operation Enduring Freedom. I retired from the Government job I had about 2.5 years ago, because I just could not function anymore due to the amount of pain and discomfort, plus my double vision in one eye/eye sight loss from a head trauma while on active duty. I need to know as like it is stated below, as I have sent messages to my Senators, and I get back a typical Republican statement that does not answer my question. I need to make sure my disability payments will not be in jeopardy, period. My wife is disabled from a stoke and I need to care for her. If my disability pay gets cut I will have to sell everything I own, as I have a house payment, bills, and her medical as well. I have been following what this administration is doing and I for one am worried as my pension from the government is small. You said there will no cuts the Veterans Benefits? I need some reassurance on this.\nIt’s my understanding from reading Military.com that President Trump is following recommendations from Project 2025 by the Heritage Foundation. While I agree with rooting out fraud, waste and abuse and think DOGE is doing and excellent job. I am fearful of Veteran’s disability compensation being radically changed! I AM AGAINST ANY REFORM OR CUTS to disability compensation! I am a total and complete 100% disabled veteran and retired! Veteran’s have sacrificed more than any other segment of the American population other than maybe law enforcement. As most retired Vets are on a fixed income any disruption to that income could lead to catastrophic results to include increased homelessness, depression, anxiety and even suicide. Veteran’s have earned every single penny of their compensation and under most circumstances had to fight the bureaucracy tooth and nail to get it in the first place. I beg you please do not vote yes on any bill that would include changing VA disability compensation in any way shape or form. There are PLENTY of other places to cut spending without the continued sacrifice of our Veteran’s. Thank you for your time.\nHey, Doug, what a bunch of bullsh-t. You work for President Musk and vice-president Donald Trump. They are nothing but bullsh-tters. How can you guys fire thousands of VA professional workers and expect things to improve for us veterans? Trump is a five-time draft dodger. He never served in the military. Neither did President Musk. They don’t give a sh-t about veterans; they only care about themselves and their billionaire friends. You have to do what the -ssholes tell you to do. How do you expect veterans to believe or trust you? Two of my VA medical appointments were recently canceled and rescheduled farther out. My primary care doctor is booked up close to the end of 2025; actually, I can’t even get an appointment with him. My doctor appointments are now being scheduled with nurses. I don’t care to hear your bullsh-t, which is just parroting what your bosses tell you to say. I’ll believe you when you can stand up to Musk and Trump, bring back the fired professionals, and make actual improvements at the VA for veterans and VA employees. Oh, and tell Musk and Trump to take their DOGe bullsh-t and stick it up their -sses.\nIf you feel like it is time to do something about your disability rating send me a message. Don’t put it off any longer.\nUS Army Retired PA and former compensation and pension examiner\nDear Secretary Collins,\nI am writing to express my concern regarding the potential staffing cuts at my local VA facility, which is already critically understaffed. It has come to my attention that these employees, who have undergone a rigorous and lengthy vetting process, are at risk of being reduced due to financial decisions influenced by external factors, such as the actions taken by Elon Musk and his involvement with DOGE.\nWhile it has been assured that monetary benefits for veterans will not be affected, the quality of care we receive is undeniably compromised when there are insufficient staff to meet our needs. The dedicated federal employees at our VA facilities are crucial to maintaining the standard of care that veterans rightfully deserve. Reducing their numbers would significantly strain the remaining staff, ultimately affecting the well-being of the veterans they serve.\nI urge you to reconsider any actions that would lead to further staff reductions and to prioritize the needs of veterans by ensuring that our VA facilities are adequately staffed and resourced.\nYou lie. You are posting a pro Trump video. Doge doesn’t need my info. My disability is minimal. I deserve more.\nDear Secretary Collins,\nI am writing to express my concern regarding the potential staffing cuts at my local VA facility, which is already critically understaffed.

Tell me Veterans, do you feel supported?\nHe supported the decision to FIRE 1,000 VA employees\nMr Sectary\nI filled out the form and the computer says I already made the comment and things still haven’t changed in the last eight years.\nWhen are Vetrans going to not be treated as non-citizens! The care at the Vets station is still shitty and we are still being treated like we are COVID restrictions. You can’t even go in to drop off paperwork without an appointment. The guard at the doors won’t even allow you in to talk to someong to make an appointment. I am an 80% rated DAV and had heart surgery in Brockton MA in 2007. Was put on these lifetime drugs. When I moved to my new location because of marriage I was told by the VA station I couldn’t get my heart medicines because they weren’t service related. There is tons of missing benefits here and we are treated like animals.\nArthur Christopher Tanny\nSecretary Collins,\nFirst and foremost, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT.\nSecondly, I started reading through the previous comments and personally I was shocked at the vitriol and downright hate (SCREAMED) at you and you just walked in the door. I am sure you will have everything straight by next week.\nAs some of the posters noted, their distrust of the VA and all of the red tape is warranted, taken sometimes years to get anywhere. Personally, I am a proud Vietnam Vet 68-69 and I didn’t approach the VA because I felt there were many more Vets that needed the services more than I did so I stayed silent. However, fast forward to 2021- I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Cancer and CLL-Leukemia at the same time. I reached out to the VA to see if I could get added to Community Care with my outside Oncologist to be able to get my medication through the VA Pharmacy. On the outside this medication is $3,000 a month but through the VA it was $11.00 so you can see why I worked through the process and was successful. Fast Forward once again to 2023 my VA Oncologist asked me why I wasn’t submitting paperwork for the Pact Act benefit which listed CLL Leukemia as being associated with Agent Orange. I applied and after back and forth paperwork over months and months I received my 100% disability, for which I am eternally grateful.\nThank you for what you are doing and good luck as you dig through reams and reams of backdated paperwork. I’m sure you will be finished by next week.\nFrom a fellow Georgian\nI agree with our secretary in TOTAL. DOGE will make the necessary cuts anywhere possible and most needed to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of our tax dollars.\nSo how does his speech line up with Elmo firing a thousand probationary employees of the VA?\nYou Trumpers really know how to lie with a straight face, don’t you?\nThe VA budget is being cut and VP Trump via Project 2025 seeks to minimize veterans benefits. That covers healthcare, disability, staff, hell, you’ll probably go after pensions next. Your sick Prez Musk is in your computers right now removing people and projects and cases and accessing our personal and financial information illegally. You’re Trump’s sycophant. You and the rest of the criminal gang want to kick us to the curve and let us fend for ourselves.\nBecause this is an oligarchical coup, not a government, and the only thing you care about is your tee time. Not us. End the gaslighting. Just tell us when you’re going to remove certain services.\nTo anyone reading this: if you abstained or voted for Trump, YOU are the problem. We who voted rationally don’t want to hear your whining. You refused to listen to your libtard neighbor and your snowflake kid who insisted you were voting against your interests. He’s in there now. Think he’ll leave after four years? Ha! Fascism and oligarchy rule now. We’ll be lucky to see another election until he’s out.\nThis message is not WCAG2.1 ADA ]accessibility compliant. The text is too small to read and there is no button to click up or down to change the font size.\nHey knucklehead, they have already been reduced with the lack of hiring nurses and in other ways. Stop the gaslighting!\nLots of complaining about what hasn’t even happened and “you support an authoritarian” blah blah blah. Shut up. I’m not sure all of these responses are from Veterans, way to self interested.\nWhen are Vetrans going to not be treated as non citizens! The care at the Vets station is still shitty and we are still being treated like we are COVID restrictions. I am an 80% rated DAV and had heart surgery in Brockton MA in 2007. Was put on these lifetime drugs. When I moved to my new location because of marriage I was told by the VA station I couldn’t get my heart medicines because they weren’t service related. There is tons of missing benefits here and we are treated like animals.\nArthur Christopher Tanny\nThank you Secretary Collins. You are a good man and are dedicated to veterans. The system is pretty broken and has been for decades as you know. DOGE will find tons of fraud I’m sure. Hopefully with the common sense decisions you will be able to help the VA get some efficiency!\nWhy is the government telling the VA they can’t prescribe pain medicine ? Tylenol, Advil, Aspirin doesn’t always do the trick. I’ll bet when someone in government needs pain meds, he can get them without any hassles.\nI personally believe we veterans deserve the continued assistance we require. The VA health system has been my lifeline. It has provided me with numerous treatments and medications that have sustained my life. I could not have experienced any better care even on the outside as much as I have at my VA facilities. Please do not take this very needed assistance from us. Thank you.\nThank you for VA services, veteran’s care, efficiency, and all services and funds provided!\nI communicate with the entire staff on my VA visits and I hear the same thing all the time. All staff feal they have no say in what their department needs. In the military we had the same problem! The officers have to communicate with the grunts to know what their needs are. I hope the new administration can make this happen !\nSo, reading between the lines here… our benefits are in danger, the administration is looking to cut services to us, and this is Mr. Collins trying to hide that fact so we think that we’re safe so when Musk and his goon squad do come in, we won’t be ready for it.\nI remember that NY Times Op-Ed about how our benefits package is too generous. I remember the limp-fisted attempts to manufacture consent for this. Musk and Trump think we’re stupid, and either Mr. Collins does, too, or is desperate to save his job.\nI doubt if anyone appointed by felon T can be trusted.\nRight. Way to toe the line. Cuts will come. The republicans are after Medicare, veterans benefits, Medicaid, and social security benefits. If you are working to improve the VA, then why did you allow President Elon to fire 1,000 VA workers? I assist veterans with obtaining benefits and I am seeing simple things like keeping a college attending child on the veteran’s benefits taking upwards of 10 months (and counting). Don’t say you’re improving when they are reducing efficiency and the ability to get benefits.\nWay to toe the party line.\nI have a vet friend. Who is 100% because he has a rare terminal blood cancer caused by Agent Orange. He just got a letter from the VA. It stated he was being DROPPED to 10%. His cancer is service connected and will eventually KILL HIM. Why is he being downgraded?\nThank you for your work\nWe must fill the jobs a our VA’s Hospitals across the country so we get the best care after fighting for our country as we were promised.\nOh, our data a safer alright. Problem is us vets can’t get into our accounts anymore. Read the comments on the how to sign in section!!!\nWatch for censorship here, as is common in Yahoo.\nI THINK THE ISSUE IS THE RUMORS AND OTHERS WHO ARE ANGRY RELATED TO THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\nI THINK IF YOU PROVIDED AN OUTLINE OF WHAT AND HOW YOU WILL MANAGE THE VA WILL CLARIFY ALL ISSUES.\nPLACE ALL ISSUES IN THE SUNSHINE; OPEN TO PUBLIC REVIEW.\nIF FRAUD; SHOW THE FRAUD ETC.. WHO, WHAT, WHERE , WHEN AND HOW MUCH?\nPROVIDE RATIONAL FOR ANY FIRINGS OR REMOVAL OF VA STAFF.\nI AM 82. VIETNAM ARMY MEDIC IN 1966-67 IN CU CHI, TAY NINH, IRON TRIANGLE, HOBO WOODS TDY WITH 196TH. LIGHT INFANTRY.\nALL I REMEMBER ARE DEAD; IN VIETNAM OR IN THE STATES.\nIN 1966-67 15,000 KIA’S. I STACKED A LOT OF KIA’S, DID A LOT OF DUST-OFF AND MORGUE WORK.\nHOW MANY KIA’S WERE ONLY 18?? I TREATED BLIND INJURIES, HEAD INJURIES, AMPUTATIONS, BURNS.\nI DO NOT KNOW HOW COMPENSATION CAN REPLACE LOST BODY PARTS.. I TASTE IT, SMELL IT AND FEEL IT EVERY DAY. WE DID OUR DUTY.\nNOW YOU MUST DO YOUR DUTY. GOD BLESS.\nAnd you all are going to believe this guy? Wait (not too long) and watch. Be ready to act (if you haven’t started already).\nThat guy is pushing the party line and that’s to be expected. But I only see our nation crumbling around us if we don’t protect ourselves.\nFelon and draft dodger Trump, ignorant and uninformed, continues his vengeance against the federal government, hurting veterans and their families. Congress and the Supreme court must stop the lunatic, and send him to prison where he belongs.\nSecretary Collins,\nNeed we remind you that going on video for all the public to see with a bald face lie will mark you a liar and just another sycophant to the king wannabe. The administration is leaning HARD on every single organisation to make 50% cuts in personnel! VA has always been under staffed and sorely underfunded….exactly how are you planning on improving care and services….your math doesn’t add up and your dog doesn’t hunt.\nThank you for you gracious address to all Veteran’s. The VA has assisted me in obtaining a college degree in education. I taught U.S. History, U.S. Government and taught other subjects including Coaching High School sports.\nI was a Hospital Corpsman in the Vietnam War and in maneuvers I damaged my left shoulder severely and needed basically a rebuilt shoulder. Unfortunately, the shoulder never healed properly and have had seven other shoulder surgeries, plus a replacement shoulder on both the left and right shoulder. The VA has been cordial and I have had a disability since 1975. I am now at 90%. I have suffered many years with mental and emotional stress and a divorce because of being drafted the same month I was to get married. The many days away and missing loved ones home caused great animosity. The ridicules, the spitefulness, the blatant acts employers displayed with their discriminatory acts of hiring then later firing because of so called necessary lay offs particularly to Vietnam Veterans. It took me thirteen years to finally feel caught up with those who didn’t have to go in the service for many unexcuseable means that dealt with the rich and what congressman did you happen to be acquainted with. All wars are always fought by the pons on a chess board, or families are just to poor to get their son in to the reserves, national guard and of course college. I have never come to grips with all of the anxiety and the deceitfulness that I constantly received. I still can’t decide what branch of the military I belonged with. I did appreciate the respect the Marine Corp gave to the Hospital Corpsman. One of the greatest titles I have ever received is “DOC!” I am still attempting to finalize my disability to 100%. It may bring a conclusion of the four years, difficulties after the military years, and anxiety and emotional setbacks. Sorry about allowing me to sound off. I feel I have but a couple of years left and I would feel compensated for those many years of unsureity. Sincerely, Daniel R. Polad\nMr. Secretary,\nWhile you raised important points, it is noteworthy that you did not reference the current budget proposal that aims to implement these exact cuts. While I understand that media coverage may not always align with the perspectives of officials, it is essential to recognize that the media plays a crucial role in informing the public and promoting awareness. If there are claims being made that you deem inaccurate, I urge you to counter these reports with relevant information rather than relying on political talking points. regardless of our political affiliation, Veterans deserve transparency and honesty regarding our benefits and the policies affecting them. Therefore, it is imperative that you and your team provide us with accurate and comprehensive information. We understand that you are the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. As such, we expect full transparency and request that you address the current budget proposal that aligns with Project 2025’s goal to implement several radical changes to VA benefits.\nSince DOGE is currently conducting finical awareness, will VA Disability have an increase. Like when Congress voted on a 40% increase to their annual pay. Also will there be a look into revising the appeal process for disability, some vets have been dealing with this for over 5 years. Lastly , will they be reviewing TAPS? Didn’t get much out of it to be honest.\nYeah you really shouldn’t be carrying Trump’s water.\nPeople are gonna be pissed, and your reputation will be in tatters. We aren’t stupid.\nMR. COLLINS,\nAS A COMBAT VETERAN, I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE VA AUTHORIZE GLP1 FOR WEIGHT LOSS PURPOSES. CURRENTLY THE VA WILL AUTHORIZE GLP1 IF YOU ARE OBESE OR DIABETIC. THERE ARE LOTS OF US WITH WEIGHT LOSS ISSUES BUT BECAUSE WE DO NOT FALL INTO THE TWO PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED CONDITIONS, WE ARE NOT ELGIBLE FOR GLP1 OR SEMIGLUTIDE MEDICATIONS. MANY HAVE WEIGHT LOSS ISSUES BECAUSE OUR AGED BODIES NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY TO METABOLIZE SUGAR. IT’S VERY SIMILAR TO HYPO THYROID CONDITIONS, THE BODY QUITS MAKING THYROID HORMONES AND WITH PRESCRIBED MEDICATION WE CAN LIVE A NORMAL LIFE. I’M EATING 1000 CALORIES PER DAY AND CONTINUE TO GAIN WEIGHT. SO PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING SEMIGLUTIDE MEDICATIONS TO THE VETERANS FOR WEIGHT LOSS MEDICATION. I CURRENTLY HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR THESE MEDICATIONS.\nTHANK YOU,\nAL LEHMAN (ALSLEHM@GMAIL.COM)\ni want to remind the President and Trump that this countrry’s veterans are highly trained and do not take it well feeliing that our government is going to try to take away any part of our earned benefits. Screwing around with veterans is a fast way to be removed from office one way or another. Also, get the Camp Lejeune Pact Act done!\nYou’d better hope so\nYou Sir, sound like you are completely full of sh*t. Just another T**** stooge. “Hit the ground running”?? Yeah, sure did—abolishing basic rights enshrined in our dear Constitution and claiming to be the arbiter of ‘what is law’ or not. Literally calls himself a ‘king’. What the actual f.\nWe certainly can’t trust the new potus, so why in the hell would we trust you when you say he’s doing a ‘good job’?? Pound sand you smarmy politician.\nI am a Georgian and Disabled Combat veteran from my service in combat in Vietnam and Gulf ! (Desert Storm).\nI offer my congratulations to my fellow Georgian Secretary Collins on his appointment. AND to my fellow vets i know this man from his campaign rallies for political office in Georgia, and he is a fine, honest man who will offer HOPE to vets for equitable and FAIR treatment by the VA. He has already addressed his intent to greatly improve the VA and I hope we as Vets can aid him in helping us.\nLike all of YOU, I await better things.\nIf you say the VA will not be affected then why have VA employees been fired by DOGE ??\nI do not believe you. I do not believe you have our best interest at heart and I do not support our President Musk and his lackey Trump. I did not vote for those derelict felons and so don’t appreciate our personal informative being given to them. My family going back to my grandfather has served in every war since the Civil War. The way this government is going, we will not be the United States of America anymore. We will be the United States of Russia or whoever has the most money.\nDo not touch our benefits or you will see war.\nPlease get the Community Centers in Colorado to approve care outside of the VA. I’ve having to pay for my care while they sit on the paperwork. Then to be told that their doctor that reviews case said no over rides the PCP (who’s in North Carolina. Haven’t seen a physical doctor since 2020 ) from the VA. Been fighting this for 3 years for care and can’t get reimbursed for treatment that I’ve had to pay waiting. They have 45 days to processes refusals, then send a notice denied for continued care on acupuncture. When they do approve it’s for 11 visits. If they allowed 30 visits for a year it would save money in all this process. Folks that have test for cancer and other serious conditions are having the same problem here in Colorado. I have been to the VA in DC and they have the Community Care call me which doesn’t solve the problem. I’ve been told by them the “Corporations” policies state they have to deny at least once a year. I have a long list of excuses they’ve given me for delays and denying or approval. Please help.\nOur benefits may not be getting cut but it is a shame that the job cuts and hiring freeze has stopped the expansion of a new CBOC branch in Las Cruces New Mexico.\nI don’t believe a word of it. Anyone appointed by the current regime is suspect at a minimum, a co-conspirator and kleptocrat in reality.\nHe’s a trumper. I cannot trust him.\nThey cut the Veteran Crisis Hotline this week. This is so necessary for veterans who are suffering from PTSD and suicidal ideation.\nOn average, around 17 U.S. veterans die by suicide each day. In 2023, according to the most recent VA data, Its around 17 to 22 people daily.\nAs for the Veterans Crisis Line, the VA reported that in 2023, the hotline received about 1,000 to 1,500 calls per day on average. The number of texts and chat messages has also increased, showing the desperate and growing demand for mental health support among veterans.\nCutting these services means more people who are desperate don’t get the help they need. It means more people will die. I’d much rather have my tax dollars go towards helping kids be able to each school lunches and veterans in great need than padding the pockets of people destroying the last fabrics of community and care we have for our most vulnerable. Tax cuts for the rich don’t benefit the great good. No one voted for this.\nDOGE is a scam designed by south African musk and felon don to screw veterans out of their benefits.\nThey’ve already fired suicide prevention counselors and other vital VA workers.\nDo not trust them. These fascist are dangerous.\nThe secretary of the VA, Doug Collins, speaks with forked tongue!! Check the Ann Arbor, MI VA. People are being fired. One lady with 38 years there and only 2 years from retirement, gone! Take his words with a grain of salt. That VA medical facility is one of the busiest in Michigan.\nthere are approx 19,000,000 living Veterans.\nless than half, about 9,000,000, are served by VA.\n(far less have P&T ratings)\nimagine if VA had them all or even 75% — they’d need 6x budget increase, as they already need a 3x.\nREMEMBER THE VA’S MOTTO\nLIE, DENY, THEN YOU DIE!\nSO YOU ARE GOING TO HELP THE VET. I AM A VET US M C 66 70 IN NAM. I GET TREADED LAIK A DOG OR WORSE AT THE V A. HOWABOUT 38 MONTH TO GET HEARING AID. HOW ABOUT THE V A LEFT A TUMER IN MY HEAD FOR 4 TO 6 YEARS. I COULD GO ON AND ON. IF THE VET CONG DONT KILL YOU THE V A WILL.\nDoge needs to be eliminated like all enemies of the American People\nThanks, good to hear\nIt’s a cinch you’ve NOT been keeping up with nor understanding EXACTLY what is happening within and to our VA! You “claim” to be partnering with DOGE … however, these teenagers have NEVER been vetted nor given “clearances” as any other government worker HAS to do. They are also NOT experts in contract development nor do they have the necessary background/expertise in budget forensics. They are ONLY programmers who know LITTLE about the Cobalt (one of the main program languages used by our government) language or HOW to use it. WE have no guarantees that they are NOT just scamming the data as there are NO apparent guardrails to ensure WHAT is done with that data both during and following their “rummaging around” those databases. You are NEW to this Department and job. You have NO ONE with any historical background to understand WHATEVER they might tell you. We know, for a fact, that they’ve delved into the SS database and have NO expertise for dealing with that data. Their claim that some 150+ year olds are still being paid PROVES they have little expertise to parse out the data in a meaningful way! I’ve no confidence in your ability to “cover” the VA’s needs given how you’ve addressed this attack on the VA data.\n100% SC veterans at the Louis A Johnson VA Medical Center in Clarksburg , WV. (VISN 5) are waiting over one year to get dental services needed in the community, that they cannot offer in house ! Only approximately 6 veterans per month are approved on the waiting list of over 100 names ! Why ?\nVerty nice shill for Trump. I don’t believe a single word out of your mouth.\nWilliam Bushey\nEx-Navy, retired Military Sealift Command Boatswain.\nyet. not happening yet.\nmaybe it won’t — you did not say that explicitly. but, if you are backing that with some kind if trust with those two. whew. but you sound like and are a politician.\nWhat branch of the service did you serve in ?\nClearing claims faster than ever seems to be by denying them. I Was at step 5 for the past 10 weeks, then suddenly I went backwards to step four and got emails that I’m going to be redoing my C and P Exams, I’m guessing to do their best to make me look like an idiot and a liar. I try very hard to get by day to day, I raised 2 kids with my disabilities and how I still don’t know. I constantly feel on the brink of losing my sense of reality and breaking down beyond the ability to pick myself back up. I don’t know how to try harder,, I’ve given it all I’ve got. I know longer know what to do. I know there are others in what seems like a desperate place and now this, now another failure. You say you’re here to help, but I now feel that is a cruel untruth . I’m going to pray for me and all of the other veterans that are counting on you.\nBrenda Grimm\nI DO NOT BELIEVE YOU. Prove it that you are going to keep and expand the VA work force that is in dire need of MORE health professionals, not less. When I can not get an eye appointment for six months at the VA in Lakewood Washington and have to go to community care, THAT IS WRONG. We need more VA professionals, not less. Tell DOGE, go to Russia to find savings!!\nut oh. now we know our benefits are up for the chop.\nThese people are straight up liars.\nI was recently drooped from80%to seventy because they said they made a mistake and keep saying bone on bone gets better what kind of doctor or human being is that stupid afer 43 yers\nNobody believes you. Of course why should we be surprised.\nHow does DOGE define “efficiency”? That’s such a broad term.\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/\nClose and sell all VA Hospitals and clinics, property, medical machines, etc. All of those employees laid off (DR, NP, RN, MA, etc) will hire into the medical field where they want, filling staffing needs at local hospitals and clinics. It will either grow hospitals and clinics, or empower those workers to start their own businesses and locations. You could even give them preferential service agreements/contracts. That allows us to go wherever we want/need to go for services needed. The VA ID and SSN is our insurance card. VA gets billed & bargains with the providers, and settles to pay them. That way we find and keep our PCP, specialists, etc. No need for travel claims and reimbursements. Selling the buildings and properties will also allow new businesses to develop and put money back into the VA. Only a few employees would be needed for staffing admin (negotiations, verifiers, approvers, and logistics). Run the numbers and tell me I’m wrong.\nY’all just cut 1000 workers and you’re trying to feed us this line? Trump calls us all suckers and losers, and you’re one of his sycophants who defends him relentlessly despite that. You need to do your ACTUAL job and defend veterans with more than just false reassurances and platitudes, what are you actually going to do to help us? Hire those thousand people back and then further expand the VA’s workforce because a consistent problem with services is everyone who works for the VA and does real work is overworked due to how poorly staffed it was before your lousy boss decided to cut that many people for no good reason. Do better. Don’t let some illegal immigrant heading an illegal “department” destroy the VA.\nhttps://youtu.be/9RMzs0EplZw?si=RBEJ–KbuMUvZnmT\nIn the words of Carol Kane from the Princess Bride, “Liar! Liar! Liiaaaaaarrr!” Of the 1,000 VA employees who were cut, hundreds of those were direct service providers including those who man the Veterans Crisis Line. Many others were claims processors and related positions, who are responsible for making sure veterans claims for benefits are processed in a timely and quality manner. Therefore when you say we are putting the money to use for veterans, you are liar.\nOnly two defining forces have ever offered to sacrifice their lives for us, Jesus Christ and the American Veteran. I’m a 100% disabled veteran and any reduction or cuts to our benefits would create a hardship for me and my brothers! BM3 USCG Cold War veteran.\nDear Sir,\nI have faith in you looking after the veteran.\nThank you\nDon A.\nI’m sorry to see the VA secretary become a mouthpiece for the lies that the POTUS is spewing. I’m sorry, but he’s not worth listening to.\nALL of these firings within government institutions is “their” effort to have only those loyalists (fellow republicans) staffing them. Voter rolls were the first to be examined before the chopping began! Trump hates anything to do with the military (having stolen the one million he raised for vets during his 2015 campaign). Remember how he refused to honor WWI vets while in France during the 100th year anniversary of the war because his hair would get wet! He’ll disrespect and will take everything away from you, too!\nHow could we believe ANYTHING that this guy says, based on who he represents?? It’s so sad. Unfortunately people will find out after the fact.\nWhen will the Secretary address the issue of benefits which have already been cut? Namely, the reduced hirings of doctors, nurses and technicians throughout the 170 hospital and clinic system. The shortage is acute. The only way a vet can see a real doctor these days is to protest the medical attention of “nurse practitioners,” who obviously are not doctors.\nVeterans are not dummies. We see, as Secretary Gen. Shinseki warned before Trump fired him, that a certain faction of politicians and avaricious businessmen is doing all it can to make the VA appear to be dysfunctional and failing, so that the way will be paved for giving the VA to Wall Street. And the ultimate reasoning behind this nefarious plan is that our free hospital system for veterans is “socialism.” Capitalists hate giving away “free stuff,” even if it is vital medical services and drugs to care for the men and women who sacrificed their precious time and sometimes their health and their very lives to defend the United States of America, whatever role, great or small, that they played.\nBetter helping us? Clinics and centers are already understaffed, in what reality is firing 1000+ staff helpful? How is downsizing the Crisis Hotline helpful? How is getting rid of SSRIs and telling receiptents to go to ‘wellness farms’ helping veterans?!\nIn what reality is taxing benefits and even thinking of limiting benefits and making them even harder to get helpful? This administration is turning into a dumpster fire and regret ever having voted for him and his unelected lackey. I have more trust in the real people getting notices and emails within the VA, on ground dealing with all of this and sounding the alarm then I do a bought yes-man.\nCan you get the VA clinics to hire more doctors? There seems to be a shortage and have to wait months to get into to see one! Also, can you get the VA clinics to start answering their phones? I live in Texas .\nSad situation!\nSecretary, you say at the end “…come to see me.” I need to see you and give you the first-hand look at what this highly rural service-connected disabled veteran needs in the form of efficiency. And I can fill you in on exactly where it is so inefficient in the VISN 20 system of VHA. I don’t need to apply for a claim, I don’t need to ask for more money, I don’t need to hope that the Office of Rural Health will be there for addressing the rural veteran’s delima of the benefit of basic medical care because this division of the VHA is only apparent to the veteran in this corner of the country to be a research gathering institution and no longer accessible to the veterans that depend on that voice that separates us from the urban veteran that has much more efficient/available/more choices of receiving medical care whether it be basic medicine or even more critical, the unique medical needs of that mostly alone to the veteran and not that of the general human race. Please let me know how I can speak with you, I’ll even be glad to make a trip to the big building in DC where you keep your desk, that is if I’m even as a veteran allowed to enter that building (past administrations made it off limits in the simplest of terms where as it was easier and more productive to be invited in to the White House complex just down the street). So please reach out to me and I’ll be glad to provide some efficiency from the most western spot in the lower 48 that one can live…and loving it.\nPersonal note: I always knew the chaplain had my back in the many years I served, and it’s the chaplain once again that has had my back in recent years at the VHA, and I understand and have confidence the chaplain on the flight deck is going to have my back also. Instills confidence there is hope.\nI don’t believe anything this man says. He is nothing more than a Trump toadie.\nI would like to come see you.But ,i probably wont be the only one.\nI find it hard to believe the words coming out of the mouths of imbecilic lickspittle…\nThank you very much! Unlike many people commenting on here im doing great! I appreciate my benefits, it seems like everyone is a victim these days. If you need any help let me know. Make America Great Again!! ?\nLeave my VA and my disability benefits alone. Stop firing staff! Allow me to continue to receive the excellent health care offered me since 1975. And I don’t believe you Collin’s.\nThis could not be more wrong. VA employees have been fired en masse without cause. I fail to see how that could possibly make anything faster. Where is your integrity? Shame on you, Mr. Secretary.\nWe have been waiting many years and were told by the end of June this year. (first it was January. Hope they get more people to help sort this out.\nHe’s lying. Like a snake. This administration and all their toadies don’t give a damn about veterans. They’ve fired the staff manning the suicide crisis phone line. They DON’T CARE about us. Period. This is all bullshit and mirrors, and we vets need to stand up against those who would reneg on the promise we made – our lives for the safety of America, and they will take care of us afterwards.\nWhy are my comments not being posted as I wrote them? I thought we had free speech in this country.\nThat’s what Hegseth told the DoD…And now guess what President Elon has announced?\nIn the Philippine, they do not pay travel pay because a few file a false travel claim. Instead of punish them, they are punishing all veterans. I think if someone file a false Travel claim, they should lose all their VA benefits.\nLook into veterans getting private doctor prescriptions filled at the V.A. pharmacy.\nWe can’t see our providers because we have NO providers. Tell me what’s efficient about that. The programs mean nothing if they are not accessible and efficient. How do I know this? I’m a Physician Assistant and have practiced medicine for 18yrs in the Army and now in the civilian sector. THE VETERANS NEED HEALTHCARE and other services NOW.\nIf they aren’t going to attack VA benefits, why has musk and his clowns fired people hired to saves veterans lives from committing suicide!? From what I’ve read musk and his idiots have started firing sucide hotline personnel!\nYou are serving a criminal who is dismantling my beloved Republic in a EO coup and handing over unconstitutional power, to an unelected, unvetted, Unconfirmed by Congress civilian billionaire that has him by the short and curlies. You and the rest of his fascist oligarchs and lapdogs should be ashamed of yourself, and you’re not. You have spit on my constitution, my oath(and your own) and my service as well as all those who have served before me and continue to do so. If you voted for Fat Nixon, you are either complicit in his crimes, or you allowed yourself to be duped because he hates the same people you do. You are NOT patriots. You’re nothing but low-level co-conspirators and I wished you would feel the pain that’s coming the most. But that’s not how this works. You’ve hurt all of us equally. Way to go.\n“find things we need to get rid of…”? That’s oddly not reassuring. What do you mean? What things? Be more transparent!\nYOU SOUND LIKE ONE OF TRUMP’S HENCHMEN IN WHICH WE SHOULD QUESTION ANY STATEMENT MADE. IT’S A SORRY STATE OF AFFAIRS, BUT THAT IS WHAT MYSELF AND MILLIONS OF OTHER AMERICANS ARE FACING. WORK ON GETTING TRUMP OUT AS PRESIDENT AND INTO A JAIL CELL (WHERE HE BELONGS AS A CONVICTED FELON), AND THEN YOU MAY BE MORE CREDIBLE.\nThanks for making it clear to all Veterans.\nAny veteran that voted for the current occupant of the White House betrayed the oath they took and disgraced the uniform. Our fathers and granfathers fought a war against fascism…. and you voted for it.\nI agree hole heartedly\nyour good i support trump and believe you\nYou don’t hire a bunch hackers (including a teenager) to do audits and forensic accounting work.\nI give this guy as much credibility as I do Trump and VP Musk- zero.\nNo veteran wants to — nor deserves to — be held in suspended animation while you attempt to digest the words of a lactose intolerant Commander-In-Chief with a documented history of bone spurs.\nThe rest of us have REAL issues.\nSecVA Doug Collins is either cutting veterans benefits or he isn’t. Don’t play the game, twinkle toes.\nRestore the SIPU’s Combat Vets need them\nWho removed Paragraph G in VFR 1108.08 and why?\nBill Montanari\nInteresting. Tell me, why would there be a need to “find things we need to get rid of”?\nWhere did that money go that you will have to “put the money where it belongs …. back with our veterans”?\nCan you give a guarantee that it won’t get “lost” again? I know, there is no guarantee.\nThank you for clearing up the rumors. Additionally thank you for taking on the role of VA Secretary, this job will certainly change you.\nI am very familiar with the Charles George Medical center in Asheville, NC. My husband had a hemorrhagic stroke in August 2020. Agent Orange left my Viet Nam vet with, among other things, chronic high blood pressure that, although he lived an incredibly healthy lifestyle, caused a small blood vessel to burst in his brain. My guy, who was a very successful small business owner, a great father, a builder of all things, including a family, a business, a cabin cruiser sailboat and our current home, has spent the last 4.5 years in a bed, having been robbed of all his gumption and motivation, not to mention the use of the left side of his body. He’s a shell of the man he used to be.\nIf it wasn’t for the Asheville VA and the amazing and dedicated employees and support staff, helping to guide us through the complicated morass of the system we would not still be in our home, I’d probably be in the hospital and my husband would probably be in a substandard hell hole of a “nursing home”.\nHow dare you and your commander and his ilk be so damned cavalier with the futures of the men and women who kept you and all the rest of us safe by offering up their own lives in service. How dare you fire the very people who make so many veterans’ and their families’ lives more liveable!\nEvery damn single employee (or volunteer) we have encountered at the VA medical center is there because they CARE and appreciate the men and women who serve/served this country. We do not need less of them, we need more! I feel very fortunate that my husband received his disability rating (a year after initial application), I am being compensated for being a full time caregiver (a year after initial application) and that we just got major funding for a converted van (a year after initial application) that my husband can drive his wheelchair into and we can actually TRAVEL to the VA again. We hope to go visit our daughter and other family members now!\nIt was the dedicated workers through the VA who made this happen for us. We are grateful every day for them. They, like the Capitol Police officers, should be held up in praise for the sacrifices and dedication they have made for us. WE NEED MORE OF THEM.\nIf you want to eliminate WASTE, start at the top, with the commander in chief and the unelected Elon Musk lording over the DOGE.\nHow long will you continue to lie to our faces!\nStart answering the 100s of questions posted here instead of continuing Trumps big lie!\nIt’s about time I am a combat wounded from the operation desert stormn/shield seen combat and got danger pay and over seas pay and got the combat action war ribbon but not a combat action badge why not thank you joseph\nDon’t believe a word this man says. He is Trump selected.\nWhy does the VA play with my percentage? every time I have had an evaluatuion they may give me an increase in the area of concern at the time, but decrease the percentage on a prior evaluation percentage.\nSo….. I call B.S. Sending Vets out in the community isn’t “improving Veterans care…” In the 21 yrs I’ve gone to the V.A., I’ve never had a bad provider. If you think waiting to be seen would be better, try calling a civilian provider for an appointment and see how far out they are booked. The V.A. is well versed in matters specific to Vets, like Agent Orange exposure, etc; that civilian providers (especially those with no military service background) are not experienced with. The contract with those who defend this country is based in part by the country providing care…it’s one of the reasons we take so much less compensation then our civilian peers. Pushing us out to the civilian community is just a ‘passing the buck’ play of shucking that responsibility.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins The VA is already trying to cut my disability benefit by 10% and deny me benefits for PTSD (even though I provided a buddy statement from my commanding officer who also served as VA Secretary), TBI and presumed exposures to cons diesel fuels etc\nLooking forward to the improvements and increased focus on Veterans!\nThank you for the update !\nWe are supposed to trust your word? I didn’t cripple myself in order for fascists could take over our government.\nVA Secretary Doug Collins The VA is already trying to cut my disability benefit by 10% and deny me benefits for PTSD, TBI and presumed exposures to cons diesel fuels etc\nIs he seriously defending Trump & Musk?? They are both destroying the country and firing numerous government workers including Veterans and closing entire government agencies and Doug Collins says Trump & Musk are doing a good job! Maybe it is because he is afraid of losing his job and then again maybe he actually believes what he is saying, but Trump & Musk are destroying our democracy right before our eyes and people like Doug need to face reality because I just heard on the news that Musk is coming for The Pentagon next!\nDoug Collins I am very disappointed in you!!\nHow can we be sure that you are truthful? Certainly, the president isn’t as well and is not being transparent. How can we trust you when you believe in him?\nI am a 90% unemployable disabled Army Veteran. I am also 63 years old. I fought tooth and nail and struggled for years to receive my rating. To cut my compensation would truly put my wife and I in jeopardy. The VA has been helping me and my wife now that my rating has been increased. I have VAHC and she has CHAMPVA that helps us with our medical care.\nI have faith in Pres. Trump and Elon Musk to cut government fat. I was shocked to see what USAID was spending on other countries under the title of CHARITY. That money could go to homeless vets or programs for Americans.\nMr. Secretary I have confidence in you and your office. I trust you are fighting for the Veteran along with Sec. Hegseth and Pres. Trumps team.\nHorse excrement. I was at my VA clinic today – there is a nurse shortage AND A HIRING FREEZE thanks to your buddy the S. African fraudster and his little band of DOGEbags. Congress already woefully underfunds the VA to serve veterans and now the hiring freeze..?\nYou’re a liar, sir.\nNEW COMMANDER IN CHIEF BOYS! AND HE WORKS HARDER THAN THE LAST 5 ADMINISTRATIONS PUT TOGETHER. NO MORE FUNDS FOR DUDS.??\nOne week on the job and Collins is already attacking the media who is trying to report all the cuts this administration is making. Collins is lying, they have already fired all the provisional VA hotline workers.\nBS. I was at my VA today – there is a nurse shortage and now a hiring freeze. So even if you were telling the truth the VA is woefully understaffed to serve veterans properly. And that is on the Congress. Call your buddies and call OFF the foreigner and his DOGEbags\nYour comments are all in present tense. You do NOT affirm that benefits will not be cut in the future.\n1000 VA employees were cut. The VA was already understaffed. Where are we when VA staff retires?\nOur new VA secretary is an obsequious Trump toady . I watched the video. No explanation about the 1,000 employees who were fired last week. Plus a half truth about DOGE. We don’t know if they’ve taken VA patients information – yet. But they already have every US citizen’s personal info following their raid on the US Treasury. Yes, Project 2025 plans to cut your benefits. The way I see it, the plan is to annoy you into giving up by having you constantly re-verify your disability rating, plus some services will be made unavailable to you. I’m sure the new Secretary is going to be OK with that. A lie by omission is still a lie, Chaplain Collins. Proverbs 19:9 A false witness will not go unpunished, and whoever pours out lies will perish. Oh, and remember Mr Secretary, If you “hit the ground running”… You’re more than likely going to trip and fall on your face.\nI don’t believe anything that Trump, Musk, or any Trump appointed person says right now. Trump said one minute that Medicaid wouldn’t be cut. An hour later, it was announced that Medicaid would be cut. Firing employees at the VA doesn’t say to me that the cuts are meant to provide better services. It’s the exact opposite.\nA tax on is a cut. A reduction in COLA is a cut\nI am in the same boat with others for my Pact Act retroactive claim.\nDoug Collins on the job one week and he’s already attacking the media. This guy is getting ready to cut benefits, all the while lying through his teeth about it.\nAnd when will something be done about Fort MacClellan. All the chemicals we WACs endured. No one has helped. Sad sad sad yes we are getting old and death has knocked at many doors. Are you waiting till only two are still alive?\nYikes, the wording in this is so concerning. Another pandering to the corrupted leadership. Sure, they won’t do this or that….then proceed to do exactly those things. I’m not holding my breath.\nDEI removal from various VAs already making the staff take down anything dealing with Black History, LGBTQ+, and Woman Veterans says it all. The illegal “promises” of paid leave so you won’t just get fired later is all a joke. Then, not stopping the hate given from old, hateful, brainwashed salts to various minority groups that are also Veterans like themselves is just sad. What happened to this supposed comradery?\nAll of us Veterans served to preserve the freedom we ALL enjoy in the U.S.A., or is it just for the straight white males? This whole video makes me disappointed in the appointed Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\nThere are a lot of individuals below that worded it just so excellently. I will be submitting complaint after complaint to all the various offices until shit stops going backward in time. Even before all of this, it was and still is a full-time job to babysit the VA into doing what it is supposed to do. Several VHA Directives were broken, and lies were spouted. If the military had not messed me up, I wouldn’t be dealing with this organization but here we are.\nIs he seriously defending Trump & Musk?? They are both destroying the country and firing numerous government workers including Veterans and closing entire government agencies and Doug Collins says Trump & Musk are doing a good job! Maybe it is because he is afraid of losing his job and then again maybe he actually believes what he is saying, but Trump & Musk are destroying our democracy right before our eyes and people like Doug need to face reality because I just heard on the news that Musk is coming for The Pentagon next!\nDoug Collins I am very disappointed in you!!\nI was told VA is cutting benefits for tinnitus patients. This was alarming. I do suffer from tinnitus but when I had my hearing tested at the VA in Houston I wasn’t tested for tinnitus, I was tested for hearing damage starting from my separation date. After 6 years working on fighter aircraft I have to ask twice, turn the volume up too high for others and other issues not associated with tinnitus and in conjunction with tinnitus. If my disability benefit is cut, so be it. But reading this article seems to conflict with what I was told. So thanks.\nSo why are VA staff members being fired for no reason? That’s not lawful, what about the families of those employees?\n“Trust me, I’m the president”\n“I’m not a crook”\nThings to remember.\nI don’t trust you Collins. I hear that anyone who obtains a position like yours has to state that the 2000 election was stolen in your interview. I don’t trust that sociopath Musk and I damn sure don’t trust that draft dodger Trump. Trump is an amoral unethical dishonorable liar, convicted felon, corrupt businessman and politician who sexually assaults women.\nI hope that what you’re saying is true and that they won’t be taking away veteran’s benefits, for your sake and mine. Because if they do, Oh boy. I can’t even imagine what 5 million veterans, their families, active service members, and the people who support us would be willing to do to wrench that back from a despotic regime. The second you do that, the second a coup starts. Good luck getting the military at large to support you.\nSo much waste. Like paying to ship insulin overnite and it takes FedEx 3-4 days to get it to the veteran. Most time ice pack is warm. Putting the Dexcom transmitters with prosthetics . And then trying to call and ask for refill. No body at VA answers phones. Or returns a call.\nHopefully you’ll go back to letting vets go to outside resources when the waiting list is to long for care.\nThis is how it was done during President Trumps first term and veterans loved it.\nPlease go back to this exceptional resource.\nThank you Secretary Collins\nVetnam vet my records were cleaned came home 1968 they keep denying me veterns affairs needs to get fixed\nHow about helping Veterans who served Honorably instead of Denying better percentage rates. Trillions if dollars go over seas, and billions went to illegals, but Veterans get denied.\nThe secretary can’t guarantee that. How can we trust what the Secretary says, in any case?? 8% cut at the Pentagon and veterans are getting fired so who’s to say that benefits won’t be next in the spring?? You can’t guarantee that Secretary, now can you? Chaos is all that we’re seeing and no promise lasts 5 minutes around here…\nRhank you to all of those trying to make things better !@\nPlease make the VA Insurance considered “ credible” under Medicare guidelines so we can quit paying $180/ month to stay qualified for Medicare without penalty if the VA ever drops veterans currently under VA insurance\nWhy did they cut the Hotline for veterans that had veterans who were thinking of suicides calling in?\nYou are working for a person who lies and is not concerned about the American people let alone the veterans who served this country for the freedoms we all enjoyed no matter what political party you belong. This is a person who had called veterans who were MIA, captured or killed, losers when he never served in the military. How can we trust you to protect our veterans when we can’t trust the person you work for. Will you have the guts to stand up to him and his ridiculous side kick ?\nI hadn’t heard the rumor that benefits were being cut. I DID hear that most of the layoffs at the VA were veterans. Is that true?\nStaffing at my assigned VA Medical Center was already short staffed and personnel cuts will be devastating. I saw my primary doctor at the Baltimore Medical Center in December, when two lumps were found on my throat. She recommended that I be seen by an ENT specialist. However, the earliest appointment I could get is March 4th. Three months to address something that could be very serious in unacceptable. The first week in January, I was referred to physical therapy for lower back pain but the earliest available date is February 25th. I also asked if I could go through Community Care to have my therapy done locally because I live an hour and fifteen minutes from the medical center. Previously, it was quickly approved for another problem. However, this time it was quickly denied. So, at this point, it surely doesn’t seem like money and staffing is being directed to better Veterans health care.\nYou are working for a person who lies and is not concerned about the American people let alone the veterans who served this country for the freedoms we all enjoyed no matter what political party you belong. This is a person who had called veterans who were MIA, captured or killed, losers when he never served in the military. How can we trust you to protect our veterans when we can’t trust the person you work for. Will you have the guts to stand up to him and his ridiculous side kick ?\nAs a mouthpiece for the man who is carving up our civil services and selling them to his toadies, things already weren’t looking great for you. Then you put out this video lying to our faces when we can read exactly what the executive orders say and we know VA staffing, budget, and benefits are being attacked. They’re even floating taxing VA benefits as income as if that were a sane idea. You ought to apologize to us and wash your mouth out with soap. You ought to resign. I’ll thank you to at least stop lying to my face.\nI’m in Spokane where they have been trying to “fix” the new computer system for the past 5 years. If you need a place to flush more money…I’ll take it. The system should have been scrapped years ago. It was to work the day it was paid for and still has problems. Veterans are tired of reporting them as it seems no one cares.\nI Do not trust a draft dodger or a legal alien musk digging into our personal business like soc va and our personal bank accounts veterans deserves better than this.\nI have been fighting the VA since 1969 to have my disability upped to 100%. The most they will grant me is 90%. I have a bullet in my back, and scar tissue from the base of my skull down my back to just above my butt. I also have a scar just behind my left ear and numbness on my hands and both feet un into my calves. Most a bullet logged in my back that somewhere in the paperwork went from be recognized as a bullet to shrapnel fragment. It clearly shows a bullet on my x rays. The VA refuses to understand that I have serious health conditions and continue to ignore my doctor’s letters and medical records. DEALING WITH THE VA especially NOW is horrible and because of the strain it puts on my health I have to step back and keep quiet. There isn’t any hope of help from the VA especially with tRUM P AND musK IN OFFICE.\nAnother Trump shill following his marching orders in fealty to draft-dodging lying Trump. Nothing but bold-faced lies from another radical right christian nationalist on a mission to implement Project 2025, which was the intent all along. I think we’ll soon see Veterans medical services handed off to a private corporation that will only give veterans less service for more money.\nI hope you do I was treated for cancer I did not have 6 months of 3 kind’s of chemo and my primary care doctor told me to shut up about it also severed my lyranex throat has a hole in it\nWhy should we trust anything anyone from this administration says about anything? Going by previous history, none of you cab be trusted.\nThere is no way the VA will operate as efficiently as it should when you fire thousands of employees without doing due diligence and without having invested the time to understand the processes.\nThis is reassuring. However, at Charles George in some clinics long awaited doctors in the employment process ready to join a clinic are having their commitments cancelled. Doctors needed to provide long needed care where the need has for a long time out weighs what can be provided.\nI wish I could believe this guy.\nVietnam vet here. I volunteered to serve, unlike your draft-dodging blustering bully of a President. VA workers are ALREADY being fired and you have the utter gall to gaslight about “improving services.”\nYou are a disgrace and should resign. With all due respect, f-ck off.\nI try to utilize myhealthyvet but cannot figure out why I can’t make progress with any issue that arrises. I got a n assistance with try to find records within the new sign-in processes, and with the assistance was able to get some things to work but during the 5 month process, have lost the myhealthyvet account Username and password to the account itself. The system says my account has no username or password on it.\nHow can it determine the file is there if when requested it says neither item exists??\nI do not want Trump’s goons hacking my email for their filthy N- political messages. Now they want to politicize VA. None of the cowards served, but they’ll suck on the blood of those of us who did. I don’t want Collins hacking my email for his N- agenda, Now I hate Trump and his goons worse. Get out of VA.\nConsidering the manner in which all this CHANGE is taking place and the commotion it is causing, there better be something really noteworthy on the horizon.\nChange for the better is good but the manner in which it is being undertaken is questionable.\nI don’t believe Mr. Collins. When the VA has been understaffed and underfunded for at least 50 years, with reports of “probationary staff” at the VA are being fired, and with current difficulties in getting timely appointments, I have serious trouble believing that things are improving. I can imagine VA staff is having a hard time wondering who will be fired.\nWith p47’s past comments about veterans being losers and suckers, I don’t believe he or anyone in his cabinet will make the veterans’ situation better.\nGerald K. Ambroson\nThank you Mr.Secretary and Congressman for your video and straight to the point, no bs regarding the rumors that gets amplified by those using scare tactics. I served 30 years in our Armed Forces, served 1 year with the VA and soon realized to many didn’t live by the creed of President Lincoln’s promise during his famous Gettysburg address. I have also served 11 years as a DOD government employee. Yes those rumors travel fast and many retired military and active duty personnel hear these rumors and I appreciate your video and your words addressing the rumors!!\nYou lost any chance of getting respect from veterans when you allowed Elon’s baby N-s into the VA and gave them access to the computer systems. Congrats on being on the job for only a couple of weeks and already losing the trust of the people you claim you are here to serve. If you are doing anything under the “leadership” of a certain hitler wanna be, then you will never get an ounce of that respect back. YOU ALLOWED THEM TO FIRE 1,000 employees right off the bat, and you think we trust you?\nWhat a crock of trump.\nI don’t believe this sh-t in the slightest.\nThere is nobody associated with the fat orange felon that can be trusted.\nI’m rich, I’m a 0.43 percenter, so I really don’t care if I get my 100% disability each month. Maybe all of you out there should have been a little more financially responsible while you were wasting your money on nonsense.\nThank you for your commitment.\nThank you Secretary Collins for reassuring Veterans that our hard earned benefits are safe under the leadership of President Trump. However, like a football game we are only in the 1st quarter. I continue to be concerned until the 4th quarter. I have heard about 1,000 VA employees (many Veterans) being fired with little or no notice because they were recent hires. The VA must take care of its workers who in turn take care of its Veterans. Please continue to place our Veterans, some [other than me] who have given so much, first. (2/327th Infantry, 101st Airborne Division, Vietnam)\nSir, yes you are clearing cases, but not in the favor of the veterans at all, just the VA. Please don’t try to tell us different! Apparently your office doesn’t answer any questions, as I’m seeing from others. 2 weeks, Sir we’ve been dealing with the bullsh-t longer than that. Ugh!\nAs a veteran,as well as someone who worked at the county level of the VA helping vets with claims and benefits, why would I believe anything he had to say. He is appointed by trumpthefelon, obviously from his statement on DOGE he is giving access and is cooperating ! They are gearing up to privatize the VA health care which IS NOT in the best interest of veterans! How in a week on the job he can say they are “clearing cases faster than ever” is s beyond me! That statement alone sounds exactly like trumpthefelon’s boasting words! It’s a sh-t show that will just continue to get worse .\nCould you clarify for me how many civil service employees received letters that they might no longer be employed by the VA and what this mix of personnel looks like. You may be processing claims more quickly but are service members getting the care they need or are they being farmed out to civilian providers with 6-8 week wait periods? I am a veteran of 28 years service with a disability. I receive my care through Medicare and Tricare for life due to issues w the VA availability of care. It isn’t much better w Tricare for life as the majority of referrals go to outside agencies. The service members and their families are then on their own to find a provider. We called that turfing patients when I worked in health care. Seems there is still a lot of it going on.\nYou did not address peoples concerns about loss of benefits-you shoved it off to an irresponsible media. That is not what I, as a veteran, want to hear.\nV/R\nDoug If the V.A is working faster than ever I would like to know why my higher appeal for care givers has been sitting on someone desk since Nov 2023. And im still waiting for it to be asign to someone . My Husband is a Vietnam Veteran . And was wounded in vietnam shot by is own lieutenant is 90% he has went down hill. For any verteran are family to wait a year is ridculous.\nYou Sir are, full of horse sh-t.\nFirst day in office Trump fired bunch of VA primary care physicians. My primary was one of them.\nIt has been 4 weeks and guess what, that number has surpassed 1000+ fired VA employees. Most of them are Veterans. Veterans taking care of other Veterans. And you’re here making a short video promising what? That our hard earned benefits aren’t going to be cut? Are you all there? Do you have any clue what’s going on in the government?\nThere is combat Veterans being deported because ICE doesn’t care about documentation. Trump just want numbers. And you sit here and right out lie that our benefits aren’t going to be touched? They are already touched. From fired primary care physicians to veterans working at VA hospitals. The VA has already been affected massively even if it was a huge ordeal to Veterans just dealing with VA to begin with.\nYou’re a schmuck and a bootlicker.\nWhy should I believe you….\nSo that it’s clear, Project 2025, which Donald Trump has followed to the letter thusfar, has plans in place to fully privatize the VA and strip us of our benefits. The method they’re using is identical to how they systematically destroyed the Postal Service last time they were in office. If you are reliant on your veteran’s benefits for your medical care, housing, income, or otherwise, you NEED to have an alternative in place for when they do to veterans what they’ve already done to farmers. I could frankly care less about what Mr. Collins says. Also, you need to be resetting your credentials in all of your VA-related websites; Vice President Musk’s kindergarten class had no business being anywhere near our personal data, and you should expect to have that information leaked or spilled, so have resets on standby.\nStep 1, Cut 1,000 employees from the VA. Where did I get that info, https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-dismisses-more-than-1000-employees/\nVA Secretary is a full blown MAGAT.\nThis message from the boss seems to be contradicted by the notice I got yesterday that our Radiology location was closed down. I am not calling Mr. Collins a liar but don’t like the smell of this.\nI have a SDVOSB that service my fellow veterans!\nSecretary Collins,\nIf the VA is expanding benefits for Veterans, why did the personnel working on the Burn Pit Registry get terminated from their jobs? Why are no hiring actions for new healthcare workers moving forward? I see lip service, but no substance behind your words. Actions speak.\nWill a rating that is based on “presumptive findings” be across the board? I have a condition that gave me a rating due to harmful/toxic chemical exposure, but that same exposure didn’t cover other conditions like it should have. Will these conditions be re-considered? I have an appointment with my local VSO on 2/28/25. Will they know of the improvements that you speak of Mr. Collins? Is there a direct line/email to contact you? That would be great!\nI do not appreciate the new VA Secretary blaming the media for his inability to control the narrative on his agency. The media’s role is to report what it’s told frkm credible sources and journalistic standards require two verifiable sources. I only listen to and read media that follows these journalistic standards. I and my father are both retired military officers with high disability ratings; he was 100% and I’m 70%. He and I both served to allow free expression and a robust media to openly report important issues that inform the American public. This demonizing of the media is dangerous and un-American. I deeply resent the VA Secretary, who is suppose to represent and care for military Veterans who have been disabled in the the service of American ideals, to actively tear down one of foundations of our Democracy. I have personally read about the recent disgraceful suggestions of lowering some disabled Vets ratings assuming that only those disabilities received directly as a result of combat are worth compensating. This ignorant and disrespectful idea was obviously made by someone who has probably never served as it shows a complete lack of understanding of what it means to serve and the sacrifices all military members, and their families, make. Considering how little respect the new Secretary has for the fundamentals of a free and open Democracy, regardless of how difficult it might make his job, makes me believe he would support these suggestions as he seems just another puppet of an administration who also has very little respect for military members and the job they do. I an very disappointed, but not entirely surprised, that a man with these credentials and opinions has been named VA Secretary. After listening to video, that was somehiw meant to reassure Vets, I convinced that he cannot be trusted.\nYou Are A Lying Simp — 1000 VA Workers Just Got Cut, from DOGE — Many of these workers are Veterans, but you choose to spit in all our faces.\nNow if we can just get medical care sooner then 3 months from making an appointment. I don’t know how anybody thinks the VA had gotten better cause it hasn’t\nUnfortunately, any complaint or comment that is attempting to elicit a response will more than likely fall on deaf ears:\n“The comments section is for opinions and feedback on this particular article; this is not a customer support channel. If you are looking for assistance, please visit Ask VA or call 1-800-698-2411. Please, never put personally identifiable information (SSAN, address, phone number, etc.) or protected health information into the form — it will be deleted for your protection.”\n[Editor: I’ve removed eight SSNs from comments just this morning alone.]\nThis is who you all voted for so shut up and deal with it! He told you all exactly what he was going to do but I guess because you’re white you thought you were exempt lol! We could’ve had Kamala!!!!\nI am the 92%!\nWhy are VA employees, including health care workers, being told they should find other employment? I have been getting great care at the VA, but am disturbed that DOGE/OMB/Trump/Musk sent every employee an e-mail telling them they should terminate their employment with the VA. Note, my niece is a VA pharmacist and got the e-mail encouraging her to leave. Healthcare workers are hard enough to recruit as it is, why encourage them to leave? Note, my general impression from my VA hospital is that the workers are paid less, but the work atmosphere is better: less pressure to bring in revenue.\nSo glad you’re in charge of the VA, the quality and customer service and response time has suffered over the last 4 years.\nMake this website more useable. This thing flies you all over the place except where you want to go!!!\nWith all due respect, Mr. Secretary, you are gravely mistaken about DOGE and their actions. I urge you not to mislead our nation’s veterans with false information. Take a closer look at the insidious activities DOGE and the mastermind behind it are orchestrating within the federal government. Our veterans deserve the truth, and something ominous is on the horizon for them.\nThe VA could save a lot of money by allowing veterans to opt out of appointment reminder notifications sent by mail. Personally rarely ever arrive prior to the appointment.\nDr. Hunter R Novak, AD2\nThank you Mr. Secretary. Those of us that use the system, know all too well the deficiencies that exist, and I suggest to you, please visit with veterans and hear us out. I also support the elimination of dei. It is rampant within the VA. Good luck to you sir, and visit Houston sometime soon.\nI don’t believe a word of it\nSecretary, you’ve been there a week and already the VA is doing better, processing claims faster. Do you think we’re stupid! You have a credibility issue! Are you firing staff, or is the unelected DOGE bypassing your authority? Operating so much better while DOGE does its work? Come on!\nRun the VA appropriately, leave your political bull out of it.\nI guess he thinks he can bull sh-t us. My disability rating claim is stuck at step 3 since August. But Doug can fire 1,000 hard working, tax paying VA employees and delivering faster than ever? Who does he think he’s kidding. This guy doesn’t have two functioning brain cells to rub together. He’s as clueless as the rest of this administration’s picks. If\nI’m lucky I’ll get to keep my current rating but I think these guys are going to try to screw us over. Remember his boss thinks soldiers are “Suckers” and “Losers”…\nNo, the “media” is not the problem. I’ll take good investigative journalism over the nonsense you just spewed any day. Your video message was so unprofessional it was like if you think your audience are a bunch of brainless knuckleheads who can’t think for themselves. We deserve much more respect than that. Try again.\nI claim has been on APPEAL FOR FIVE YEARS. I am still waiting, Can you please help me!!!!!\nTypical leadership-speak that happens before budgets are cut. The VA Secretary doesn’t control how much the VA receives, others do. Usually it’s Congress, but it seems to be DOGE now. In either case it’s 20-25 year old staffers, who lack meaningful experience, that do the detailed work. So, (all too many) cuts will be made in the wrong areas.\nBeing a “company man”, the VA Secretary ultimately will proclaim success, stating: waste was cut; money was saved; efficiencies were achieved; and service was improved. As evidenced by his video address, Secretary Collins knows this is how it will play out. But only the part about money being saved will be true. But don’t blame Doug Collins – he isn’t the one swinging the budget axe.\nMore bull sh-t from one of Trump’s inexperienced hired goons!\nI do not BELIEVE ANYTHING this administration says at all, musk and his vice president do nothing but lie and these spineless republicans do not even push back, when are they going to realize that they need to stand up to him ,he is not God or a god musk and his co-president are going to ruin this country we fought for our country that more than these 2 clowns can say!!!\nHow do I get a meeting with him. And can we get a X weekly town hall meeting\nSince we are accommodating everyone nowadays let’s award Desert Storm Veterans with a Purple Heart for combat. I mean the VA did acknowledge toxic exposures from this war by creating the PACT ACT. Let’s get the Purple Heart approved for those respiratory conditions caused by the Khamisiyah bunker explosion and release of sarin gases. Not to mention the chemical attacks by Saddam Hussein’s army or were those M8 alarms imaginary?\nWe need more wheel chairs at the VA hospital in Miami,that we can roll ourselves when we have several appointments the same day, because mobility transportation is too slow picking you up from your appointment and taking you to the next.\n2. All Veterans need full dental treatment. It’s a Shame, that because you are not 100% you can’t get it. You should help all Veterans regarding of your persentage.\nAre we supposed to believe this Trumper? The Trump administration is running on nothing but lies! Trumper said he would not touch Medicaid, now Congress is going to do cut it, and he approves it. Lies, Lies, Lies!\nHi,\nI recently requested a review of my 10% Disability, for. GI condition that has plagued me for over 50 years and I have been waiting for a determination. I was not aware that a reevaluation was even possible until recently, and it would be an enormous benefit to me, both mentally and financially as I am no longer able to work. Thank you for your time.\nHenry Thompson\nLets talk about what a scam the PACT Act is, I was denied despite having evidence and I know friends who are getting denied too.\nIraq 07 – waking up every morning to the smell of burning plastic and jet fuel.\nThey put you in charge because they know you have no courage or backbone – just another opportunist and yes man\nSecond attempt to post. I’m very suspicious of the video pronouncement. Anything coming from the current crop of “leaders” must be viewed with deep skepticism. There is clearly an attempt underway to further privatize VA Healthcare, and that is no surprise. The current administration is run by anti-human tyrants driven by one value: maximize wealth and concentrate power.\nI’ve only had excellent experiences with VA Health Care and the people are always extremely supportive and knowledgeable. When I ask VA Healthcare reps why VA healthcare is so much better than the (un)healthcare in the private sector, the answer is almost always the same: “At the VA, we care about people; in the private sector they care about making money.” Well, that obsession with making money, at the expense of the health of veterans is what they will try to bring more and more into VA Healthcare. Vets will be treated increasingly as disposable. Moves toward privatization started under Trump 1, and now under Trump 2, and the DOGE steamroller, they will roll over VA Health care. Vets better stand up soon to protect it, or it will be gone….\nThere is nothing efficient about this administration. Tired of hearing such MAGA nonsense. Give us a break, there is a rapist and wife abuser as the SECDEF who has nowhere near enough experience to run our military-he’s a Fox news host! That is beyond reprehensible-and that is who is leading our brothers and sisters still in service? What a slap in the face. That being said, I have no faith in any of you to take care of our veterans who are no longer serving, especially from a draft dodger Commander in Chief who was too cowardly to serve his country. Like everything the DOGE claims that is false and with zero proof, I doubt VA claims are being processed any quicker. You just fired 1,000 VA employees, most of them are veterans. Drop the lies….tired of an incompetent administration who cares nothing about the average American or Veteran.\namen brother!\nOh look, another status quo shill for our benevolent dictator.\nMr. Collins, I am a 74 year old Vietnam Marine Corps vet. I am 90 plus % with unemployability to 100% PT. I have a family of 5. They are all from the Philippines and are all legal with blue passports. I have a lot of friends who would love you to look at the matrix and our pay. My son from my first marriage is also as I am. 2003 to 2007 Marine and 100% by unemployability. He is 44 this year and cannot work.\nFor myself, I am under, I believe, poverty level. He is just above it. We will not be getting a raise with our President! Our raises aren’t even figured by what inflation truly is to US. Maybe you can figure out a way to at least increase the base pay for us.\nFor my son… He is moving to Thailand because social security says he can work!!!!! The government says he can’t. Maybe someone can fix the wording for Social Security or someone besides a DEI can look at his claim.\nSemper Fi\nSecretary Collins, thanks for posting this video. I hope Veterans will come to this site for VA news rather than be alarmed by the Lamestream Media. And thanks for serving our country, and Veterans well.\nDOGE, is not doing anything but wasting tax payers money. Stop falling for these lies. VA Secretary is not fighting for us he is going alone with them. They just laid off 1000 VA employees when the VA need more staff. This is BS.\nMany thanks for the quick clarification on our benefits. Hate to see guys and gals getting upset because of what has been said or inferred. We all know Trump’s way of thinking and he would not touch the benefits unless they were being taken advantaged or stolen.\nThis did not instill the trust and confidence I was hoping for from you, Mr. Secretary. You simply sounded like a Trump talking head pointing fingers and defending non-government employees. You have made it clear that if at any point the current administration says to drop veterans benefits you will bow the knee and roll over to their every whim. Very disappointing. You are absolutely not committed to us, the veterans. Grow a pair and stand for the veterans you serve, and not some childish billionaires.\nMy experience is first-hand and arises from my following up on the very unusual non-receipt of a reply to a message which I recently sent to one of my VA providers via the myhealth.va.gov messaging platform. I phoned and reached the doc’s RN, who apologized and explained that the doctor, who is additionally burdened as the department chair, was under intense stress and an unexpected extra workload because the arranged hiring of another physician for the department had been frozen. That turned the intended staffing plan, which had been inclusive of the new hire physician, on its ear and required major on-the-fly personnel assignment adjustments. Then a large group of nurses who had been working from home via their computers, since their jobs were done by phone and emailing with patients, were ordered to return to the hospital for no apparent reason, where there is no space for them! These kinds of created problems have no corollary benefits and are the opposite of improving patient care!\nWell done information, I was a recent inpatient for 8 days at the MKE VA, I found it interesting that 2 CNA staff talked while I was watching Fox news that the VA was going to have cuts ? Actually I knew better being a Retired Army member and not a Democrat voter !\nI didn’t watch the video, you lost me with your cowardly support of DOGE and its illegal activities. I don’t believe you for a second. Who doubts that your fearless leaders, cowards, liars and thieves all do not intend to cripple the VA and “drown it in a bathtub” with the rest of the Federal Government? I am offended that you think we are so blind and stupid as to believe these criminals are not going to hack away at the VA. Astonishing.\nAppreciate the information\nr/Al\nUSA/MSG(ret)\nlo que sea, donde sea, cuando sea\nWhat will people think once they find out how untruthful the current administration is with respect to what they’re actually doing; which is to undermine confidence in all government functions so the argument can then be made that privatization is the remedy to all of the made up problems that we’re currently hearing about. If that were to happen, how long do any of you reading this think it will take for those privatized and previously government functions to be raided, pillaged, and desecrated leaving all of us with nothing to show for our years of service and commitment? Better wake up.\nYeah, sure Jan. Benefits back to the veterans. Not likely, back to the wealthiest 1% and corporations. Shame on Musk and his adolescent henchmen as well as 47 for the illegal dismissal of the dedicated employees of the VA who were also likely veterans. I stand with you.\nPresident Trump made a great pick for Secretary for the VA in Doug Collins! I am very confident that Secretary Collins will fight for every Veteran in this great country of ours and Make The VA Great Again!!!!\nWhat I’m getting from between the lines is we’re gonna hear a lot more “that’s not service related” and more claim denials. Words are trash, we need to see results. We got enough lip service while serving. Show us actions and results or sit down and save the oxygen thieving.\nneither trump nor musk had the balls or the dedication to serve. if they mess with veterans that will start a very deadly civil war with men and women who are very good at combat. you do not want to f*** with these many millions of veterans most of whom believe in the 1st and 2nd amendments as highly important in protecting freedom. we the people will take our country back from felon trump–the worst embarrassment in our nation’s entire history.\nDoug, knock off the political bullsh-t; you are not a member of Congress anymore. I don’t expect to hear a partisan line of attack against the media. I will hold you accountable for ensuring there are no drastic cuts to the VA, aside from actual fraud and abuse. Not the cascade of misinformation coming from Doge. Do your f**g job and manage the VA to improve the range and quality of veteran services. I get sick to my stomach reading about the plights of some verterans in these comment.\nDoug Collins is a very honorable man. I feel very confident in his ability, integrity and work ethic. We all know you are dedicated and will give your best effort.\nMr. Collins,\nI have been fighting the VA disability benefits for 14 years. They do not recognize the Leukemia that I have and say it does not meet the qualifications that someone has set for Agent Orange. I have appealed the decision made by clerks not a doctor of oncology. I am on the Agent Orange registry two times but can’t get the full 100% disability check.I had to retire early from the Dallas Police department because of the Leukemia. It would be nice to have a doctor of oncology look at my records to make a professional opinion. I also have submitted a case of record that went to court and the Veteran was awarded the pension. We both have the same kind of Leukemia and he was given the benefit of having a compelling case.\nI’m a disabled veteran as the government knew the water that we were drinking,bathing and food that was contaminated with chemicals that the government knew. That water killed many and made veterans and families sick.. I for one spent 2 years at Camp Lejeune and have HEART issues and CANCER..I rely on my Veterans disability and medical insurance..I hope and pray the new administration that I voted in does not do anything stupid to our very loyal and dedicated veterans.. This seems like this administration cares about no one but themselves!!!\nPresident puts a freeze on federal hiring which includes the VA. – Then president removes the freeze on VA medical hires. +\nThen Musk fires all probationary hires-\nExplain to me Mr Secretary, how is firing all the new hires you just gave the green light to, plus all the probationary ( hires with less than a year already on the job) is improving veteran’s healthcare\nMy claim was received 2years and 6 months ago with no word or activity on my claim..I can’t believe that there are only 4 judges for over 400,000 claims..\nI Am over 75 years old..\nThe truth will surface about a year from now one way or the other. I live in Idaho and have to say the VA is much more responsive and efficient than the private sector health care. Please don’t mess with that.\nI find it hard to believe after over 50 years of the Vietnam War ended the Veterans are not being compensated financially for their services I attended a combat veterans counseling session I am Desert Storm/Shield combat veterans there were Vietnam Veterans attending also the reasons that I heard for these Veterans not being compusated properly is appalling you have to prove the chemical Agent Orange was sprayed in the area you served in that is unbelievable the military assigned you to fight in Vietnam and now over 50 years later I have to proved where I was in the jungle of a foreign country we need some Vietnam Veterans combat veterans working in the department for compensation to help assist in taking care of all Veterans all the opiates and the other mind altering drugs they are prescribing is not enough to help care for disabled veterans mental or physical disabilities we need help taking care of our own people here at home the good ole USA.\n2 of my va dr called me a lair. Saif I was faking my disability to gain money and benefits\nHelp me please. I have no one to help.me.\nPlus after 3 wifes 2 passed away Please help me President Trump our Commander in Chief\nThe minute king Donald say cut the VA cost and befits this guy will drop to his knees and say yes sir.\nCongratulations Mr. Secretary!\nThank you for your service.\nMay God watch over you in your new role with the VA.\nStrength and Honor!\nThank you sincerely,\nSRA Alan R.

Dissing John McCain was the lowest of the low.\nSenators and Congressmen of the Republican Party are being forced to bow to his wishes simply because he has threatened them by having them be primaried.

Is this so?\nLet’s get our Vets off the streets & into some housing that’s been occupied by the Biden Admin illegal aliens, get them fed properly and training and job opportunities that were wasted on these illegals.\nAnswer me this, WHY IS THE VA SLASHING OVER $800 FROM MY TDIU PAYMENT PER MONTH?\nThe VA loves to see Veterans Homeless EH?\nI’m going to save this video so I can make a stitch of you responding to project 2025 and president Trump removing all of the benefits you’re lying about not being cut. I bet destroying the lives of 1000 probationary employees was right up there with “improving veteran care.” Less care givers = more care giving. Got it. Make it make sense.\nFirst let me apologize for many of the comments I have read below by misguided Vets. Next, thank you for answering the call to cooperate with the President and DOGE. I think our President had done a magnificent job correcting the horrid damage done by the prior administration.\nSteve Hall, SGT, 9th Inf. Division\nVietnam Vet 1968-69\nhow come VA employees were terminated by DOGE without a proper evaluation or notice.? DOGE terminated them without any idea how it would affect VA services. We vets are not stupid so quit feeding us incorrect information\ni like and trust i watch him for year he seem far and a GOD loveing man he will bb good for vet\nMr. Secretary,\nAs an Army veteran in NC, there is a big problem with community care program. You cannot get a phone call into the office. I have had to use my Congressman twice to get any help. I am looking forward to you getting the VA back to the Trump 1st term standards like Wilkie.\nHire more people so that our claims can get processed a little faster\nNo no DOGE is illegal dont trust them. It’s beyond unconstitutional we can do better\nATTN: US Troops in Kosovo on KFOR missions since 1999, much under OEF funding. The entire place burns everything 24/7 (there is no modern trash/sanitation system) and US troops serve on NATO FOBs downwind from KEK (Soviet Era dirty coal-fired Power Plant) – it looks and smells like Blade Runner 2049. I have the pics, DD-214 and lung nodules to prove it. YET, Kosovo is NOT on the PACT Act for Environmental Exposure List. Whisky Tango Foxtrot – VA? PS- I’m also one of the rare Vets who earned BOTH the MGIB and Ch33 Post 9/11. I got the letter saying “Congrats….you earned both, please wait for our next letter in ~ 22 month”. I’d like to re-start Edu ASAP …..please.\nThis video is nonsense! VA cannot possibly care for Veterans faster ,when you have allowed DOGE to cut the workforce so drastically, and so willy-nilly, with ZERO thought to the impact of those thoughtless cuts. Long term, expertly trained employees, many of them Veterans themselves, have been fired for alleged poor performance. RUBBISH!\nDoge never took the time to look at performance. They never took the time to look at responsibilities. They never took the time to look at the fact that VA employees are truly dedicated to Veterans, who have unique issues and concerns that require skilled and knowledgeable employees to address efficiently.\nDOGE representatives at VA cannot possibly be reviewing contracts to ensure operations remain efficient and that resources are directed toward services for Veterans, because DOGE is not qualified to do so. The folks who ARE qualified to do that for Veterans have been terminated, lied to, denigrated, and insulted. Doge is grabbing as much data as they can get their hands on, and nobody really knows what data they are grabbing, or what they will do with it now. And, that includes you!\nYour comment that you look forward to partnering with DOGE would indicate that you have been asked to do so. You haven’t!\nServices are not going to be better or faster with less employees present to doing what they know how to do best, while an unelected, un-vetted DOGE is determined to cut as much as they can, from wherever they can. DOGE makes these cuts, not to help taxpayers, but to funnel money into Elon Musk’s companies, assuring that taxpayer’s needs are not being addressed at all,. Nor are the needs of Veterans.\nIt comes down to this…you took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. You also swore to support and defend our Nation’s Veterans. You can now either live up to your oaths, or fail entirely! Pick a spot!\nIf choosing the latter, you would not be alone. The vast majority of elected or appointed Republicans will be hanging their photos on the wall of shame, right next to yours, as Doge continues to be permitted to continue this chaos with no oversight, as our Veterans are abandoned, and Democracy is altered entirely.\nWhat you likely should not continue to do is to address us all with assurances that everything is A-Okay. You are honestly not in a position to provide those assurances. Nobody is.\nIn what state at they clearing cases, I have a case in DC, and file supplemental appeal that they broke into three case. There is no justice, nor when they claim an error in the case but the case remains or no change in decision dispite call center giving said information that there was an error. But I’m also sure no one cares or will fallow for more information.\nI’ve read that there will be a “means test” in 2026 using 2025 tax info. Any clarification on this would be great.\nI agree with Mike from 18 February 2025.\nLMAO like anyone is going to listen much less respond.\nThis is a propaganda piece/video. Anything coming from this Administration must be viewed with great suspicion. There is a goal of increasingly privatizing VA Health Care (already underway and pushed under the previous Trump Admin). I’ve had, up to now, only very positive experiences with the VA Healthcare and when I ask people at the VA healthcare facility why VA Healthcare is so much better than in the private sector the standard answer is: “We are here to help people; in private health care they are out to make money.” Those moneymakers are looking to loot VA Healthcare too. We must stand up and stop the privatization of VA Healthcare. The people in charge have anti-human values. They only value increases in their wealth and their power, and we veterans will suffer.\nHello Doug, my name is Sanders Cupac and I am a 72 year old Vietnam era veteran living in Thailand. I live off of my 994$ monthly social security payment and it was stopped in February for no reason. PLEASE help me. I LOVE TRUMP and the new transparency and stopping WASTE.\nPLEASE HELP ME, I am really hurting here.\nSecretary Collins, Make sure you direct them to PR. As a USVI resident and an old contractor for the Army, I see where efficiency can be easily had by using more LOCAL USVI Community Care providers (we have three Islands) and DME services. The Acting Director has stated he is addressing the discrimination he see between the PR VA and USVI Veterans and vendors. ex. The PR VA will fly a contractor to USVI to install a wheelchair tire or deliver a bedside hospital table.\nOr, they will fly the Veterans to PR to have a tooth cleaning instead of using the local Dentist that has been registered w/ OPTUM and every other similar contractor we’ve had in the past. I literally, had to fight tooth and nail to get VA community care employee to use a local dentist, pt or mental health provider for the Veteran I’m a Caregiver for instead of flying her back and forth to PR.\nYes, in the USVI we are lacking in Medical options, but the options we have are top notch, and maybe the VA should look at & take into consideration our high cost of living and give USVI community care providers an additional percentage over medicare allowance (out of the cost saving from airfare) to entice more local community care providers.\nOh hell since I’m asking for the moon, just build the USVI our own small VA hospital similar to the one we had in Alaska in the early 2000’s (just put it on St. Croix). Let me know when you’re going to do a site visit.\ndon peters II\nUSVI Veteran\n“Always out Front”\nI am an AF Vet. I utilize va community health care because I live far from any va health facility. Collins talks a good game. He’s allowing that idiot in the white house – I should BOTH idiots – Trump and Musk to get rid of va personnel that are needed to make sure va services are carried out correctly. I have to reapply yearly for my community care and EVERY year I have to jump through hoops to get it done. God help you if you don’t – I would have to pay the bills. This year is no exception. My end date is Feb 25 – I applied again in January and I still do not have confirmation on my renewal. This is just one example. These are not medical personnel but people that manage the ‘behind the healthcare’ paperwork and various other things that make the va work. BUT TRUMP HAS FIRED VETS – EVEN DISABLED VETS – FROM THE VA. You tell me how THAT helps veterans. What a load of horse hockey. You think the voters are buying this? Think again. D. Taylor\nMr Secretary: I forgot to mention the most important points.\nAs you know there is talk among members of Congress (your party) to change the requirements for\nservice-connected disability especially when it comes to PTSD. What is your personal position on\nthese proposed changes and your position as Secretary of the Veteran’s Administration?? Do you agree\nwith the congressmen’s comments that too many veterans are filing false claims and receiving benefits??\nMy position is that when ‘too many people’ are getting a benefit from the government in a particular program\nyou raise the requirements. Got an opinion??\nI am so happy Trump won. I am overjoyed that every DEI programs was cut. I hope DOGE takes a wrecking ball to every wasteful program that is ripping off the tax payer.\nThank you for the reassuring platitudes. Now, am I supposed to believe them? I suppose we’ll have to see but VAs history looks bleak. We, the veterans, have no real say and certainly no control over the services we are provided nor the quality of those services. As a medical professional, I can report they range from excellent – thanks to a dedicated, professional staff – to non-existent – thanks to a lack of funds that would make Mr. Musk proud.\nI have to say, in all honesty, that I do not trust you sir. I hope I’m mistaken. But, as the saying goes, “Money talks, BS walks.”\nAs an aside: The folks suffering the effects of the poisonous environment at Camp Lejeune will, I’m sure, receive the same timely assistance that those receiving assistance for Agent Orange poisoning: After they’re dead.\nWe’ve all been used and discarded.\nDear Secretary Collins, here in Rhode Island, we have concerns of cutbacks. Alost of rumors, to include a 91 year old Korean War Disabled Veteran being told he no longer will be assigned a primary provider, which has been responsible to prescribe his medications. As a veteran contributor for RINEWSTODAY.com I sent an email to Director Lawrence Connell, Providence VA Medical to address Rhode Island veterans concerns who have contacted me on benefit cuts due to termination of employees. More than 48 hours, and a response which only included attaching a VA press release, no response to how many employees terminated at providence VA Medical Center.\nIn addition, I also sent an inquiries to Senator Jack Reed (d) and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (d), only to receive a response without answering the simple questions sent to Director Connell.\nIm asking for answers to the following:\nHow many VA Providence Medical Center employee were terminated and their positions( I review your list of exemptions, I see NO medical or benefits that would be impacted.\nHere is the mail sent to Connell, Reed, and Whitehouse ( only to be stonewalled on answers:\nGood Day Director,\nI hope all is well.\nFew question, about an article I am working on for publishing on Thursday for RINEWSTODAY\nQ1 Did any employees working at or for VA Providence Medical receive termination letters as part of recent 17,000 employees terminated?\nQ2 If yes, were you able to receive waivers for those employees; as you may be aware, VA Secretary Doug Collins statements waivers are allowed, and not one of the firings impact Veteran medical or benefits, https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-dismisses-more-than-1000-employees/\nQ3 Last week, according to a wife of a veteran at a private long tern care facility ( which the veteran is paying for), says last week she was told her 92 year husband primary care provider is no longer employed. She request a new one, to include an appointment. She was DENIED, VA advised he no longer was eligible for primary provider since the facility he is in has one. He still will be eligible to receive audio, prescriptions, etc…But will not be assigned a primary.\nWhat is the policy for a combat disable veteran living in a RI long term care facility—-are they still eligible for a VA provider, since they remain registered in VA Health care?\nHoping to have information no later than 5:00PM on Wednesday, for an article to be published as a feature in my weekly veteran column on RINEWSTODAY, which is published every Thursday.\nJohn A Cianci\nRINEWSTODAY\nVeteran contributor\nHow stupid do you think we are? 1,000 crisis hotline workers just got let go. This is all BS lip service. You’re a straight up liar.\nI am a Gulf War veteran and lost my hearing and I am considered clinically deaf but the VA pension program has determined that I am only 10 percent disabled. I receive a paltry $351 a month pension. I fear that The orange man and his sidekick, who have no problem lying to the public, would gladly take that from me at a moments notice. Anybody who associates themselves with those two men are liars by default. You can’t support someone who tells lies more than the truth, and not become complicit in those lies.\nIt is sad when “clergy” lie! Stop being partisan! Our media is doing what they are supposed to do. Report on the news. The REPUBLICAN controlled congress is saying that VA Benefits are on the chopping block! When you have to come back and “eat crow” by telling us that you were “wrong,” but probably not in another video, because you will not have the courage to do so, WHAT THEN?!? Trump said that he would not mess with medicare… oh wait, medicare cuts are being “doged” out too. Oh wait, wasn’t it said by some Republican Senators that no VA worker would lose their job? Yeah, tell that to the 1000 workers who were fired last week. Our social security is “safe” too, right?!!! Just stop lying! We veterans deserve more than “clergy” lying!!! All Veterans deserve a non-partisan VA Secretary looking out for all of our needs!!! #STOPTHELIES\nAnother liar from the Party of Trump. VA Health is already understaffed, and now, many staffers have been fired to satisfy Trump and Musk’s lust for chaos, injustice, cruelty, and to cut spending so that they can lower the corporate tax rate to 15% for themselves and other billionaires. Does that seem compatible with the lies Collins just spouted? Refer back to this video after they drop veterans in lower priority groups from VA healthcare, in line with Project 2025, you know, the plan that Trump denied any knowledge of. Russ Voight, who is helping to oversee the destruction of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was the major architect of Project 2025 at the Heritage Foundation.\nThanks… And I’d like you to know that my local VA center here provides excellent care. I’m aware of Vought’s and Project 2025’s recommendations and I’m thankful for veteran’s organizations supporting the continuation of the services and benefits we currently have. I am still concerned at any attempts to split or divide veterans into new claimants versus old claimants or veterans receiving social security versus those not receiving social security. We all took oaths to serve our country knowing that we had no control over when or where we might be in harms way. We all deserve the same levels of care.\nPretty good video\nWe don’t believe you DOUG!\nI just went to the VA yesterday in Des Moines. They need staffing help and equipment. Please establish a hotline for us to call or chat with to keep things improving at our clinics. I have been miss diagnosed twice because of these things.\nIt would have been nice to be able to watch the video. Youtube won’t let me today unless I sign in so they can track me. I refuse to let them. So, anything you post using youtube will not reach people like me for a while at least. Youtube decides I need to sign in during time frames of their choosing for random lengths of time.\nSenator Collins, we have a huge problem with the VA in the Myrtle Beach area, myself and another veteran would love to sit down and discuss the issues with you\nsay what you want to say. ‘giving and improving services’ in your world means privatization.\nYour job is to continue this privatization program. Look at your background and your prior\nwork experience.\nThere are presently 40k unfilled positions at VA facilities. This is the hammer to use to\nsend to private doctors. Private doctors who have limited or no experience with veterans\nor veteran’s issues.\nDon’t play vets as fools, don’t bs us, tell us what you are really going to do.\nIt is disgraceful that they align yourself with DOGE and Project 2025 (which this administration is definitely following). DOGE has gained illegitimate access to everyone’s personal, professional, and financial data and we’re just supposed to accept that Elon Musk is going to police himself on conflicts of interest. Yeah right. What I would give to be a security personnel armed to the teeth at one of these locations. Musk and his fratboys would never make it to a single computer without going through an insanely extensive background check. I have veteran friends who have been waiting 2+ years on a background check and Musk just gets a green flag immediately? I call bull!.\nAs for the VA. I don’t have an issue with the healthcare I receive. Last year they extracted a tumor, and the wait time was almost nonexistent. Just had to do a number of tests beforehand that took some time. I tell my friends and family about the good care I receive, at what would essentially be socialized healthcare. Super scary, isn’t it? That healthcare would be funded by taxpayer dollars. That’s why republicans for many many years have tried to privatize the VA, which would turn it into a for-profit organization. You should be blocking every attempt to interfere with the VA unless it has to do with expanding resources or increasing funding. My local VA hospital is severely understaffed, and I live in a larger city. I can’t imagine how it must be to live in the countryside.\nMake no mistake, republicans are eager to defund the VA and turn it into profit for big pharma. Nothing scares them more than a citizen that has power over their own lives, and they want to take that power for themselves. Resist with all your might if you want the support of veterans!!\nDon’t look like a lot of NAM VETS here. Must be that we’re mostly gone and ones left are giving up.\nThat’s good to know I hope it’s true. Who is a supervisor to reach for Voc rehab. My husband school was not paid so now he’s not in school. Know one is answering emails. A phone number would be nice for Maryland\nlet us keep using ds login to access va.gov no need to make another login for va way to much work and 1 more thing to worry about as i go through during my cancer treatment\nPlease explain how loss of a thousand staffers will improve VA operations. Thanks.\nSir,you should do an investigation at the Austin VA clinic in texas.ive been going there for 32 years and it has gone to sh-t.they have mostly foreign doctors that are there for a check and don’t give a damn about your health.if I had the money I would go to a civilian doctor. thanks for your time.\nAny veteran who has ever had to deal with your entire inadequate and antiquated system for health, benefits, etc. will tell you just how BROKEN the VA has been for a very long time.\nNo intelligent veteran is going to believe the lip service you’re giving out. We’ve been buried in so much bureaucracy and red tape for so long that unless you actually back up your claims of positive change with some real action and results, you are just another politician who cares nothing about the brave men and women who have served this country.\nWe are human beings first and foremost, so start treating us as such. Look at the systems that you have in place and figure out how to run more efficiently. Ask yourself if the months and years it takes to process benefits, administrative changes, health requests, etc. would be acceptable to one of your loved ones. Would this be acceptable to you if you had no other options for healthcare? Would you take your wife or children to a VA facility? I won’t even take myself to VA healthcare, so I already know what your answer is.\nThe VA is like a sad, sad joke to veterans. It a shame that anyone who has served their country should be treated the way they are. You should be ashamed of what you’ve walked into and if you don’t do anything to clean up the mess, none of us will have any respect for you. We know when we’re being BS’d.\nAll you idiots in the comments want to blame this on Trump or Elon. You know damn well that the VA has been broken much much longer than that. So, Secretary Collins—in the event that you ever look at these comments, how about you earn your paycheck and show us Veterans some real results. Faster claims, faster appointments, update your systems… HELL, overhaul the whole damn system because it’s BROKEN. You wouldn’t run a normal business like this because it would have gone under a long time ago. FIX THIS BROKEN SYSTEM.\nSomeone mentioned contacting our congressmen. I highly suggest that we all do. It’s time for real change.\nRatings examiners are leaning on Contract C & P Examiners to give negative exams that will disqualify Veterans from establishing nexus for their conditions. C & P Examiners are conforming to the VBA’s desire to deny claims, which is trying to find fault and deny veterans’ claims. The Pact Act is not benefiting Vietnam Veterans.\nMy wife was in Balad Iraq and exposed to burn pits. She was denied on her initial claim so she asked for a higher review. The higher review said the VA made a mistake but it’s been over a year with no progress. It is not true that the VA is clearing claims quicker. She is incapacitated 15 days a month from migraine headaches a presumptive condition from burn pits. She was labeled as having tension headaches in the initial claim.\nThe voters elected draft dodging felon to be POTUS. The day after the election I asked my coworkers, “Do we have a new Commander in Chief or a new Dictator in Chief?” Not 1 person answered but the look in their eyes… PRICELESS! I cannot believe anything anyone says that works for this dude. Mr. Collins, please prove me wrong BUT, I have already had 2 appointments with my VA PMC cancelled. The first was scheduled for Feb 2025 and the follow in March 2025. I have not heard when they will be rescheduled. Do U have that problem?\nThank you for your comments and for clearing up the “RUMORS”! HAPPY TO HAVE YOU AS OUR SECRETARY, thank you for serving.\nYou sir are a liar.\nIf there is anyone in government that I feel I can trust implicitly it’s Doug Collins… I believe he will put all of his efforts into improving services and working to ensure that Veterans get everything they have earned…As a 100% disabled Marine Vietnam Vet I am at the age where a lot of things need attention and being in the Central FL area I have had the best care anyone could want and I’m confident that the future will only get better…\nI believe President Trump and Sec Doug Collin’s. President Trump has always been put veterans first unlike Biden and Obama. And Sec Collin’s was\na straight shooter as a congressman. He is a good man.\nThank you for the awesome message!!!\nAll talk…How can he say they are clearing cases faster than ever in just a week. Another Trump Simpleton.\nThank you for the awesome message!!!!\nAnd thank you for all the VA does!!!\nYour mouth is moving so you’re obviously lying. No one in the administration should be trusted al all. In fact, expect the opposite from what’s said.\nHere are things that need to change at the VA. I have been going to the N.Texas VA in Dallas for over 25 years. The doctors there have almost killed me 3 times, and it is all in my medical records. 1. Stop hiring unqualified foreign doctors. The Dallas VA is full of them. 2. Make it easy for Vets to get outside medical help, when we can’t get it at the VA. The way it works now, and the way it is set up, is a total nightmare. I have diabetes and I’m on blood thinners. The orthopedic doctors will not see me half the time. I need a shot in my knee every 6 months so my knee will not grind bone on bone. They have refused to see me the last three times I have ask. This has got to stop. These doctors are there to help us, not turn us down. 3. The service we get at the Dallas VA is shocking. I just told you about one problem. There is many more. The Dallas VA is good at covering their tracks on problems like these.. We need a lot of changes at the VA in Dallas.\nI don’t have a comment, but I do have a question. Will Veterans have to choose which monthly check they want to keep receiving and their other compensation we receive be cut out completely?\nIf that is true, then you as sos and others are NOT doing what is best for Veterans. Firing employees at the Veterans Crisis Line is just plain evil, too. If you are not a Veteran then y’all don’t know and definitely don’t care what is important and needed for Veterans.\nThere cuttin . Just denied your claim\n“Doing what DOGE is supposed to be doing.” What exactly is that? Nobody in the Administration has publicly laid out who they are (personnel), what they are doing, who is in charge, and whether they are actually employees of the U.S. government.\nYou say that the VA is doing things quicker and better now than it was doing only 3 weeks ago. Pretty hard to believe that.\nFinally you close with an offer to “come to see me.” And just how is that supposed to work?\nWhat has been addressed by my Representatives in Congress is that VA Joint Compensation needs to be “looked at as a way to cut back on unnecessary spending.” This is not media fluff but from my Congressman.\n“Doug” are you going to fight for VA Joint Compensation or immediately do what you are told by the higher ups?\nYes you can contact me with follow-up comments.\nDear Mr. Secretary,\nI am a 100% Disabled, United States Marine Corps, Desert Storm Veteran.\nYou speak so lovingly about DOGE, but who are DOGE, and what authority do they have to look at government (including VA) contracts?\nDOGE is not an official Department of the US government, as creation of Departments in the Federal Government can only be created by Congress, by law, according to the Constitution.\nDOGE is not a government contracted corporation, so how is it that they have Legal approval to enter government facilities, look at government contracts, look at private American Citizens information, stop actual government contracts and fire government employees? How is it that they can do all of this and more without Security Clearance or any other type of government background checks, or government contracts bidding?\nWhat gives you the right to forego the security requirements put in place to protect Veterans, and to just allow them to run through Veteran Administration data?\nYou say that DOGE is looking through VA contracts to find inefficiencies and that the VA is not getting it’s budget cut. First, isn’t that your job? Second, if that is true, then why are VA employees being fired?\nI request timely and truthful answers to these questions.\nI intend to gather fellow Veterans and sue you, DOGE, and the government and other heads of Departments of the Federal government, to get everything that DOGE is breaking, fixed, and to hold department heads accountable for allowing this to happen. I also intend to sue to have DOGE and it’s members, and it’s supposed leader, Elon Musk, brought up on criminal charges for likely violating a variety of laws involving:\n1) entering secured government facilities without the requisite approvals and security checks.\n2) illegally withholding funds provided by Congress.\n3) illegally accessing the private information of American Citizens, including those of Veterans.\n4) many other violations.\nThe American People, especially Veterans and Seniors, are Angry Mr. Secretary.\nInspite of your empty words, I know personally that cuts have already begun, and in all likelihood will continue to expand. Numerous employees and new hires at the Dept of VA have been removed or furloughed, including many veterans, as the government is one of the higgest employeers of vets.\nSupporting this regime causing needless unfounded destruction to our country based on lies and unsubstantiated claims needa to stop before we truly dont have a country anymore.\nAs a 100 percent service connected veteran. I’m concerned with the difficulties of seeing Dr’s in a timely manner. In Tennessee all i get are excuses. I can’t seem to get my medicine as I did in Alaska. I wish someone would contact myself so I can get honest positive results. I want to live. I did my part.\nSimple question: will he stand up and fight Trump and Musk if they try to cut Veterans benefits or be just another sycophant?\nHahahaha!!! No. No one believes you and it’s not as funny as my haha’s might suggest.\nYou’re a liar! Loyal only to your dear leader the president elon, I mean donny t.\nYou are and will continue to sell us out along with the rest of the United States.\nJust tell us the truth. I mean, why stop lying now? You have absolutely nothing to lose at this point.\nI’m sure you know and understand that our level of trust and confidence in our federal government is at an all-time low. I can only hope that your words in this message are true and that myself and other vets who have fought to preserve the Constitutional values of our country will not lose the benefits we have through the VA.\nWell one thing that needs improvement is benefits admin. They don’t seem to take the word of VA doctors regarding disabilities and instead contract out to outsiders who, no matter what VA doctors say, decide the disabilities don’t exist.\nThis would reduce outside contractors cost and better serve the veterans.\nMr. Collins, we are all for you and wish you a happy and productive tour.\nThis was a message from VA Secretary Collin’s to veterans addressing rumors about benefits cuts.\nHe succinctly stated there will be no cuts.\nYet some (obviously liberal) vets questioned his statement and went off on unrelated rants.\nIt embarrassing to witness such a lack of decorum from alleged vets who allegedly live this country.\nThank you DOGE for uncovering massive fraud—some likely at the VA—and thank you Secretary Collin’s for dispelling the rumors.\nHow about making the VA follow the law and allow us community care if we can’t get an appointment. Right now they are spitting in our face basically and not allowing it with like flat out NO if you request it. @!%^#@$#%\nYou’re cutting veterans out of the workforce? How does that help??????? Most vets are on a fixed income. I am glad II still have a job and extra insurance at age 64. This is a bunch of bull for our veterans!\nThis is all well and good. However, I will believe it when I see things change. I got out of the Air Force in November 1976 believing the VA was my Advocate. Being a Vietnam Era Veteran I know that is not the case. I am still fighting them. I fell and landed on my KNEES, they have called me a liar since the beginning because the doctor stated he was treating my right knee. I have had many surgeries since I got out. Almost all have been due to falls because of that Knee buckling. I have been honest and truthful the whole way. I cannot say that for the VA. I am at it again and see that I am at step 3 or 8. I figure that are going to delay until I am dead. They want us Vietnam ERA Vets to die and go away, and yet all we did was serve our Country while our Country spit in our faces. I will not be giving up until I am dead. Sadly The VA doesn’t really care. Mr Collins, let us see what you are doing, my Congressman never responded when I wrote him years ago.\nWe see what’s happening. Tread lightly.\nDoug, you sound like a used car salesman.\nI am a Veteran and a VA employee, and I am not buying what you seem to be trying to sell.\nWhen you start out your tenure by acting as if we at VA haven’t actually been working full speed ahead in order to serve Veterans, their survivors, and their caregivers, it shows that you do not understand how seriously we take our mission in performing the most noble job in the United States government.\nGet to know us. Get to know what we have been doing. Listen to us when we tell you what is or is not working, and what can work better. We know because we are the subject matter experts in what we do. We swore an oath because that is how much this job means to us. DOGE knows nothing about anything, and has loyalty to nobody, much less the American people.\nWe see you, Doug. I hope you’ll make the effort to see us, too.\nI have about 10+ remains in my file that’s been sitting there for years, I should be 100% but I’m not I’ve done everything in my power to get to 100% but for some reason or another and I don’t have an answer for this maybe you can answer my question why am I not not , at 100 percent::: Cancer survivor::: type two diabetes::: chronic kidney disease::: hypertension::: neuropathy::: exposure to ionizing radiation::: age range:::: And yet my file just sets there toxic water, Marine Corps base, Camp, Lejeune, kidney cancer::: kidney stones:::\nSorry I don’ t believe you sir and DOGE, Elon & Trump can all go to hell.\nMr. Secretary, Are you going to expand the act act to in clyde all exposures of toxic substances to include all of the the USA? Also anywhere in the European and Asia theater?\nMy claim was filed in 2020 and I am still waiting. All my evidence was submitted, I have already spoken with a judge and they are now just sitting on it and waiting. Years of waiting is not efficient and yet they are all still getting paid more than the average American to not help us vets. Do not even get me started on the horror show is supposed care at my local VA hospital. Those people would rather vets die than actually treat anyone.\nOn the campaign trail it was said that Project 25 was not in the plans for the government. And now we are seeing it coming into fruition.\nAnd the plans youre trying to ease our concerns about are in the CBO’s report.\nFrankly, I cannot trust that you will not push forward the agenda by the President’s Assistant to gut our government. You are lieing to us.\nUnfortunately this hold no weight. DOGE and President Trump have already fired hundreds in the VA including doctors and nurses. Appointments are getting canceled, services are not improving and can’t when you’re cutting staff. Trump said he wasn’t going to mess with Medicaid too, but now he’s all for gutting it as part of the latest bill put forth by the House. Project 2025 calls for privatization of services and reduction of disability and education benefits for veterans and that is the blueprint this administration is following.\nHow can I send you an email or contact you directly? My son who is an Army vet, is getting good service, but the VA Hospital in WPB, FL, 2 miles from the Presidents home in Mar a Lago is terrible. They treat staff like dirt and good doctors and staff leave. My son is suffering from PTSD and has been fighting the VA for 100% disability.\nYou don’t actually believe that load of horse manure do you? You can’t guarantee that VA services or benefits won’t be cut. Remember he hates the military and we are all suckers and losers. First time in my life that I’ve been embarrassed to be a disabled veteran.\nI am so happy that Doug Collins is the new VA Secretary. I am also so thankful that President Trump won the election. And most of all I am hoping that DOGE takes a wrecking ball to all the wasteful programs at the VA that take away from the mission to help Veterans. I think the DEI programs at VA were destructive and un American. I suspect that there are many more programs that are unnecessary. I also find it incredibly difficult to trust any therapist in a group setting or one on one that supports the delusion of a Veteran that thinks they are transgender. I think it is a crime to support the decision of a Veteran to “change” their gender. It was very hard for me to sit in a therapy session and be told to believe that a man is really a woman. How did that happen at the VA? I hope it ends.\nCan you address the gaining movement that President Trump is aware of to afford disabled veterans of a certain or higher disability percentage an exemption to federal income tax?\nI need immediate help with my va home loan. I’m being railroaded by the mortgage company even though I was under fema protection. I have called my senator and congressman in FL. I received letter stating they can only ask VA they can not influence even though we have been wronged. Please I tried to find your email address after you were confirmed but it just had your name no picture yet. Please help us. 22 years 3 wars 70 years old. Disabled veteran who filed for disability in 2019 and still waiting on it to get.off the administration desk. I’m totally deaf . My hearing loss was from working on aircraft and high frequency radiation same reason I could never have children but that’s only worth 10%.\nThank You Secretary Collins, Great to hear the truth as I truly believe with President Trump in Charge we will get that .Plus giving the VA What they need. Good luck GOD BLESS You and Yours ???Rev.Joe\nDear Sir, as a disabled combat veteran and a member of the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, and the Paralyzed Veterans of America I do not believe you or the current administration when you say write this drivel. The Trump administration has made it clear that the VA will be targeted for reductions, and having many appointments every month for my disabilities I have heard from people within the VA of what is going on, that good people are being let go, and that more is to come. We had a saying in Army Special Operations, “don’t piss down my back and tell me it’s raining”. We know better, deserve better, and don’t believe words, only actions. We’ll see, I’ll check back in next year and we can really see what is going to happen.\nWHEN CAN WE EXPECK A RASE IN OUR RETIRED PAYMENTS IT HAS BEEN SEVERL YEARS SINCE THEMILATERY HAS RECEIVE A PAY RASEL, EVERYTHING HAS GONE UP EXCEPT OUR PAY,\n. RESPECFULY\nRET. MSGT C, A.OLESKI L\nCONTACT E MAIL [redacted]\nDouglas Allen Collins is a lawyer, politician, and reserve chaplain. In the late 1980s, Collins served two years in the US Navy as a chaplain. After the September 11 attacks, Collins joined the USAF Reserve Command, where he presently serves as a chaplain (Colonel). As a member of the 94th Airlift Wing at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, he was deployed to Balad Air Base for five months in 2008 during the Iraq War. He is a member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the U.S. representative for Georgia’s 9th congressional district from 2013 to 2021 and in the Georgia House of Representatives from 2007 to 2013. He lost his bid for the senate. He finished third.\nHe is a “shoe clerk”, FOBBIT & RE-F.\nTrump & Musk didn’t serve. And I can’t believe any vet supported or supports them.\nHello Mr. Collins,\nWell, you said come see you if I have issues. So here I am. I have a few and no I’m not going to Ask VA on your website. I’ve been there and done that. It’s no help because it limits you to issues it’s willing to help with. Never the issues we Vets really want help with. I won’t get into them here, but if you’re serious about helping. I’d like to mail you a letter or send you an email detailing them.\nThank you,\nDan\nSounds like you’re trying to keep YOUR job! Are you willing to bet nothing is going to be cut at the VA? Please contact me on how much you are willing to wager.\nHe full of sh-t just like trump. He is lying to our face just like his boss trump. This guy is has no honor, respect and honesty every time him or his boss president elon / trump open their mouth is lies. He and his bosses trying to bring back BS choice program which is garbage. I used it before and it was nothing but garbage and I could have had everything I needed done by the in half the time it took with choice and they still never got it done right. No wonder the VA got rid of it before under president Biden. Trump ruins everything he touches like the VA. Leave the VA alone you can’t fix what is not broken and trump does not fix anything so stay of the VA system!!!!\nWhat is taking so long to get back pay. It was submitted Nov ‘23 and authorized Oct ‘24 and till today still waiting on the VA to audit my back pay.\nMr. “I been here for about a week,” this statement of assurance is hard to believe. Media spin is one of the most infectious hallmarks of our current Executive admisistration. It appears you’ve also caught the sick.\nI hear no cuts then I hear find things to get rid of! That means cuts of some kind, $, programs, Doctors, privileges. There has already been cuts! Can’t trust my own Gov SMH. I served to honor my country with excellent work that keeps America free. In a month this duely paid for Government has separated the U.S. not uniting the U.S.\nGreat, I thank you for shar5ing this video\nKeep up the good work!\nWhat about the fact that ALL hiring is suspended for the next four months? What about critical VA positions that need to be filled to support Veterans in getting their benefits? What about the fact that all new hires who were on probationary status – yes, even those new hires in the VA – have been fired? What about the critical positions that they filled? The equation is clear – cutting positions equals fewer services. It’s been a slash and burn with no strategic thinking or management since January 21, 2025.\nI’m glad to see that the VA will still be able to meet our needs. Hearing aids are critical for a lot of us, we can hear our children talking, laughing and our spouses no longer have to raise their voice. It may seem trivial to others but it means the world to us to hear clearly.\nWords are cheap — let’s see what actions are taken. How secure is our personal and medical information once it’s shared with the kids from DOGE (probably none of whom ever served the people of the US or are veterans) whose loyalty seem to be to one man, who never served, and not to veterans or our country!\nYou’re a liar! Right now the cuts that have been proposed are going to take away the call centers for VA prescriptions. You’re going to set us back 20 years. Stop lying it’s so easy to fact check you.\nI’m sure there’s nothing to worry about here. It’s not like trump just replaced the VA secretary with a talking head who claims that there’s nothing insidious about a billionaire and his team making tax cuts within the US government. Don’t worry guys, everything’s ok because trumps talking heads say so, nothing to worry about!\nGiven that the current director is a Trump appointee, I have little fairh that the benefits I was promised will not be cut further. I am sure I speak for a large percentage of veterans when I say that I will believe it when I see it. Pres Musk and his sidekick, Trump have made their opinions on the military and veterans crystal clear; that they view us all as “suckers and losers”. Secretary, I want to believe you. However, the history speaks much louder than the “thoughts and prayers” speech.\nI have had 2 cases initial file 2017 – NOD Sept 2020 on docket Hearing July 2024 – still waiting to be sent to a Judge. Almost 8 yrs so far going through the system. Cannot find out how many cases are in front of me cannot see any indication how long it may take. All I hear is it will be awhile just be patient. Not sure about rest of veterans waiting to get their cases resolved but I am beyond “not” impressed .\nJust tired of the lip service.\nI would like to talk to someone about the\ncurrent problems in getting agent orange\nBenefits. It takes 2 years to get paperwork processed. To do this I had to hire an attorney who got 20 percent off top. Not all my paperwork was submitted at the same time I have been told I have to wait\nanother 2 years for the balance. I thought I paid all of this in 1968-69 in Vietnam.\nWhy don’t I believe you, Doug? What records are the DOGEies looking at? Are they looking at my service and medical records? Are they looking at my disability compensation?\nIf Trump/Musk plan DoD cuts why wouldn’t they cut veterans benefits? I just don’t trust them at all.\nI’m not worried about our benefits being cut or revamped. But I do have a problem, back in 2016 I was separated from Service because of Budget cuts. So when I was processing out, I received a check for my services of 26 yrs. I thought okay this is good since it stated that on my DD-214 that I was to receive it and nothing else was said or mentioned. Well when I went in to start the process of my disabilities from service, so when things were all graded and I was told what I would receive. Only after that I pay back the separation pay first. I was told that I never should have taken the separation pay. I was never told that in the beginning. So with that being said is that I should be able to receive that separation pay back.\nThank you sir ?? would it be possible to further assist with dental care for veterans that need dental help but can’t get it ? Living with dental pain is hard.\n100% agree with Earnest Lewis & I’m a white veteran\nAlso think my VA care has been excellent.\nSomething our draft dodger & President Musk could never understand\nWow. That was not biased AT ALL. I do not trust anything he said. Neither should you.\n100% agree with Earnest Lewis & I’m a white veteran\nAlso think my VA care has been excellent.\nSomething our draft dodger & President Musk could never understand\nYou’re going to do more, yet 1000 staffers were cut…I can do the math.\nDont send me this trump propaganda again!\nBullsh-t. Bullsh-t with a ” folksy drawl” is still bullshi-.\nSounds like a whole lotta my Republican fellow disabled vet friends are having some justifiable Buyer’s Remorse>\nWhy am I getting communication about Camp Lejeune when I’ve never been there. I just deleted them but they kept coming back.\n~7 years from start to finish to have 4 teeth implanted by the VA!! Pain clinic intern/student bends and lodges a computer controlled needle in my spine. VA sends me for an experimental surgery, effectively shortening my life span by no less than a decade. That is just a few examples of an endless list of how poor our care is. I have never had a good experience at the VA ! I’m no economic analyst but I fully believe our medical ” benefits” should become medical INSURANCE! The DOGE thing very well could save the country trillions by doing that. No buildings to buy, lease, upkeep etc. Reduced employees wages, and utility costs. Tons of savings from my point of view. I’m beyond disgusted with the fact we veterans sacrifice up to our lives for this country and we receive the worst healthcare this country has to offer. Rarely do we have a doctor for more than 1 1/2 years before a new one appears. no family doctor, no history, just a new face and start over at ground zero. Yes now all these colleges would lose the guinea pig practicing on the veterans to earn their degrees yet I thought this was for veterans not for colleges to train students on us. We veterans deserve insurance not medical “benefits” that don’t benefit us and guarantees us the worst healthcare we can get. Am I wrong or do we not deserve to have our own doctors that we and our family members build history and rapport with? Give us insurance instead of the word benefit, which truly means if we want professional healthcare, it will be paid for out of our pockets.\nWell, the VA is as full of bureaucracy and process that weigh down the VA from getting his/her benefits. They also have process that don’t make sense to get a referral that even the referral doctors at both ends don’t understand. They also have a system that doesn’t keep the Veterans involved and aware of the process of approving referrals aka request for services, that the vet has to keep calling and trying to find out where their request is and what is the issue, instead of an automated system that helps keep all involved in every step of the process. This avoids wasted time on both the Vet and customer service rep that doesn’t usually have the info, they are just a middleman/woman. Approving procedures, test, labs and consult in the community care process is very cumbersome on all involved (Community provider, the ancillary services, the specialist, and the Vet.\nMaking these processes more efficient would save money, time and headache for the VA, Vet and taxpayer.\nI’d like to know where the data is that Elon Musk and his team of unauthorized individuals took. Elon Musk has not been authorized by Congress nor the Senate but somehow has access to our records either directly through the VA or through the treasury which ties into the VA documents. I’d like to know what happened to my personal documents and I’ve a right to ask under The 1974 privacy act.\nWhat are you doing to protect veterans?\nWhat is the current status of my personal data and records?\nWhat is being done so that an individual who is not a naturalized citizen nor authorized by Congress or Senate will not have access to them in the future?\nWhy has the VA not put out messaging that says our data is safe and not in the hands of a third-party? Is it because it actually is in the hands of Elon Musk where they should not be.\nWhat has the VA done to make sure that there was proper vetting?\nAs you can see, I have lots of questions\nSince trump made the comment when visiting the allied cemetery in Normandy, about the soldiers buried there, I have been mad every time I think about HIS comment, ” THEY WERE FOOLS AND SUCKERS”. He BOUGHT his way out of Viet Nam. I did not and neither did the 53, 281 men and women who died there.\nGreat to hear. Maybe we can get a raise on out travel reimbursement.\nThen Why is my VA primary doctor after I lost my job my car my private health care telling me I am not paralyzed and the VA is not doing anything for me and to loose weight and good luck after I just lost everything!!! Good riddance in my book ????????????✊\nHallelujah! Information we can trust!\nPlease fix TriCare\nI trust flying on an airplane right now more than I trust your word. You’re a political appointee working for a serial liar who changes his mind daily and has no problem throwing you under the bus. Thank you for the reassurance, though, bud.\nAnyone who has to defend Trump and Musk is not an honest person. Mr. Collins is a politician who will say anything to stay in good grace with our first elected felon CINC. Disgraceful time for Americans.\n“DOGE” representatives at VA are neither qualified for forensic auditing, nor are their actions acceptable on any normal basis. As for the threat to veterans’ benefits, I don’t take the word of any Trump appointee any more than I would the word of Trump itself. Nor can you improve services by firing people wholesale. 1st thing I saw at the local facility Tuesday morning was a filthy bathroom, which probably used to be cleaned by a probationary janitor that was fired. I asked staff, and yes, probationary employees have been fired. I don’t know how many. “Improving services” is a LIE. “VA employees are reporting effects that include closures of operating rooms, reductions in the number of available intensive care unit beds, and cuts to inpatient mental health facilities. You’ve gutted the SUICIDE CRISIS LINE! If you have any self-respect you’ll resign.\nhttps://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/02/19/va-crisis-line-employees-among-those-fired-amid-federal-workforce-purge.html\nA GREAT choice for this position!!!\nOh wow, the new VA secretary is totally looking out for veterans—by gutting the workforce that actually processes their claims. Nothing says ‘supporting veterans’ like firing thousands of them and pretending that somehow speeds up their benefits. But don’t worry, folks! It’s all about ‘rooting out waste and abuse’—which, judging by the layoffs, apparently means veterans themselves. What a pathetic, bootlicking stoolie. You’re not streamlining anything, you’re just setting the stage for even longer wait times and more bureaucratic nightmares. Absolute disgrace.\nVets need a resource for issues and damages caused by VA providers, where the managers and chiefs cant protect them. That includes a way to get falsified medical records changed.\nMaybe, just maybe, the VA will finally approve benefits for my husband. He served in Vietnam and many years later was diagnosed with Cancer in his sinuses that grew and pushed up to his brain. He suffered severe nose bleeds and headaches so horrible he couldn’t even sleep. When we applied for benefits to help my husband, he was denied because the VA said we couldn’t prove it was due to Agent Orange and his type of Cancer was not on the “list” of covered Cancers associated with Agent Orange! Even though the doctor (ENT) stated it was most likely the cause of his Cancer, but how the hell does one prove that? The VA did tell him though, that if he was ever diagnosed with Type II diabetes, he would qualify for full benefits! The ONLY thing they approved him for was a cheap set of hearing aids. He lost his hearing and his teeth due to the Cancer treatments, but the VA still wouldn’t cover the costs of any of his treatments. Thank goodness we both had jobs that helped cover most of his treatments, but the VA definitely turned their backs on my husband.\nI don’t believe one word from a Trump appointee. I know damn well, that Trump/Musk want to cut everything possible to fund more tax cuts for the poor billionaires. I absolutely believe General Kelley and General Milley, that Trump thinks Veterans are suckers and losers. I remember everything Trump said about John McCain. So, how long before our medical care gets privatized? It’s a GOP dream come true. I get great care from the VA, as it is now, and I can tell you story after story about when the VA outsourced scheduling after the Phoenix VA scandal; I couldn’t get tests done, because the private company didn’t do their job.\nIt took 2 whole years after the awful private insurance company bowed out, for the VA to catch up on unscheduled appointments. My 2 ratings equal 100%, so of course I receive 80% disability. How long until these DOGE people come after it? I don’t believe that they don’t have access to our private information. How would you know? Musk has locked everyone out. There is zero oversight of DOGE.\nIf you believe anything they say, then I’ve got land in FL for you.\nAnd if you voted for that you are getting exactly what you deserve so stop whining.\nA couple of comments:\n1. I saw a report on CNN two days ago about a 10 year Marine Corps veteran who was working in a key administrative position in a VA clinic, cutting through red tape for patients, scheduling appointments, and ordering supplies, but was just fired. How is this suppossed to help veterans seeking or receiving care at this hospital. Who is taking over his duties? According to the Marine Corps vet, there was no time for a transition plan. If one expects the nurses and doctors to assume these duties, there is no doubt that access, availability, acceptability, continuity, cost-effectiveness, and quality of care will likely be adversely impacted.\n2. I am a 60 percent disabled vet and receive care in the community. I’m going on a month now waiting for VA Martinsburg to extend my community of care provider in endocrinology. Until this is accomplished, I can’t see the endocrinologist, nor order my insulin from the VA pharmacy. How many people were cut from the community of care offices?\nit’s too soon to tell, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt, But I am incredibly skeptical with anything DOGE touches. I haven’t seen anything but wildly outlandish claims not backed by any substance and reflex actions taken without any understanding of the consequences. To be openly accepting of what they are doing before they’ve really done anything strikes me as disingenuous and dangerous.\nThank you for the informative message. The wait me and other veterans have endured is too long. Currently I have an appeal that I had a hearing in late October that was filed in 2019. Another Appeal was just awarded in November of last year. Waiting and going through the various hoops is frustrating to say the least! Thank you and please improve this process\nWhy in the world should we trust Doug Collins, noted Trump sycophant since 2016, to tell the truth? Trump thinks we are losers and suckers, he absolutely does not care about us.\nFellow Vets, do not listen to these mercenaries. CYA and guard your assets. They will absolutely cut our benefits if it benefits them.\nThank you so much for the video! This is why the “bad” extreme left media just needs to be shut down. They don’t know what to do with their narcissistic minds, so they keep putting out bad information. There is something seriously psychologically wrong with them. They are not listening to the millions of people to do what is right with common sense. Just a complete shame!!!\nAlso, for the Camp LeJeun cases. If you have an attorney, they wait until they have 500 cases or more and then go to court for the day. The attorney’s are taking 30, 40 and I have talked with some that are taking 50%. There should be some law on that one a senator should put a bill forth.\nAnyway, thank you Mr Collins\nThen why did I just get told by my primary care doctor that all of a sudden I’m not paralyzed and there is nothing the VA will do good luck and lose weight????\n???????\nAnd we’re supposed to believe maga? Yea, right. Magatards are famous for telling the truth and not for baiting and switching at all. Man, thank you so much for your assurance and for your unabashed integrity. We’ll see how the future goes but I have no faith in bad faith.\nFor all legal purposes, DOGE is not a legal Department and should not any business reviewing anything related to the American people.\nAs I recall, that’s what the Inspector General’s are for. Because no one wants to stand up to the person who occupies the WH, everyone has to suffer. The President continually lies to the American public and frankly, it’s embarrassing.\nThe American people deserve better and especially our military and veterans.\nWhy should we believe that our benefits are off the table? He would do and say anything to save himself.\nThank you Secretary Collins. As an Army veteran and supporter of President Trump, I know that President Trump is the best friend of we veterans and that you and him will do the right thing.\nI don’t care about the cuts maybe they should and maybe we’ll better service too many veterans died because of the va not helping them\nThe new VA Secretary is obviously an arse-kissing TRUMPTARD. Elon is not finding waste, he is simply cutting things he wants to cut in order to get himself (and his fellow billionaires) big tax cuts by screwing real Americans. Over 1000 VA workers have already been fired. So the idea that we are going to increase benefits and improve services is a complete lie. Our so-called president is a wartime Draft Dodger who calls veterans Losers and Suckers – and this is how he “honors” real heroes.\nAs a disabled veteran, it took a year and a half to get approved. I didn’t know the system and realized I left out hearing loss tinnitus and sleep apnea so I finally applied for these things and got approved for everything except for sleep apnea which makes no sense it’s all about money. And that took another year so now if I appeal, it’ll take another 200 days to get an answer from my appeal. I think they’re just hoping that we die so they don’t have to pay out. I hope you change my mind. Thank you.\nYou are saying this to keep your job knowing that any negativity about the President will put you on the chopping block. I do not have faith that this administration will protect our benefits as they are already following everything else in the Project 2025 manual. You cannot trust anything this administration says or does.\nAnd what is being done to protect veterans’ jobs in government service?\nAlthough the VA might be maintaining benefits for veterans, my wife was employed through the VR&E program with the VA, and fought hard through her probationary period with the VA. She only had a little over a month left to go and was cut despite outstanding performance reviews. Although I believe that there are individuals taking advantage of the federal employment system, a massive cut of just blanketing probationary employees was not the way to go.\nI don’t belive a single word that you said. You were appointed by Trump because you are loyal to him. You cannot be loyal to him and the country, including all of the Veterans you claim to represent. You represent an authoritarian regime that is trying to destroy our country and turn it over to Russia. My father and uncles fought facism in WWII but you are embracing it by being loyal to Trump. Trump and Musk have already fired over 1,000 VA employees, including doctors and nurses, but you don’t seem to care that our healthcare will suffer as a result. How is taking medical services away from us while lowering disability ratings “giving and improving services.” How do we know that an unvetted billionaire or his unvetted teenagers haven’t already been at our medical records? After all, he’s aready received access to our Social Security numbers and tax information, so what’s to keep him from accessing our medical information and benefits? I know that you won’t, because you are loyal to Trump, which is why you were appointed. The plain and simple truth is that you cannot be trusted.\nYou are not telling the truth. Cuts will be made and the money will go to give tax cuts to the rich. You should be ashamed.\nI apologize, but, “Faster then ever?” I have had 2 claims in for almost 2 years… And another one in for 7 months, just to add my 18 yr old high school senior back on my dependent list, since he was taken off as soon as he turned 18…\nNot to mention, now my employer of 19 years, has recently made me fill out multiple questionnaires about my PTSD. Now I have been required to switch jobs and schedules within the Department !!! Hopefully whoever is in charge of the EEOC can make some appointments available within the time limits to file a charge for discrimination, but that doesn’t seem to be happening very quickly either. Although I WOULD NEVER, I’m really starting to understand why there are 22 a day that give up…\nThank you for the information,for the past four years the VA has been SILENT!!\nThank you, sir.\nI know the va has treated me great and will continue to do so my only concern is that it takes what seems to take forever to get paper work changed when you get a rating change just in my case I have been waiting for the va to add a dependent added sense July of 2024\nI hope its true you (Mr Collins) are here to help the Vet. Please, be honest with us the vets of the wonderful country\nThis bogus, of course doge is looking for CUTS going . All one needs to do is look at all the CUTS to varios federal agencies creating more danger for Country and devasting affect for families. Ask yourself why havrn’t programs paying the various contracts that Musk have with ANERICAN funding??\nI dunno man, the 1000+ layoffs at the VA that everyone is hearing about doesn’t give us a lot of confidence in what you’re saying. Frankly, no one, other than Trump and Musk can even say if VA benefits will be cut, because they are the ones in charge.\nThank you Secretary Collins for your reassurance that veterans benefits won’t be cut. It’s very difficult to understand why that would even be considered by our leadership. I am hopeful you will be successful ìn your thoughts for all veterans.\nI am a retired female Veteran. After reading most of these comments it saddens me that so many of us are waiting YEARS to get a reply concerning our disability claims. I ask you, why would anyone in their right mind ever consider joining any branch of service? We gave to our country and then the government just disregards us when we need help because of what we have experienced while serving our country.\nPresident Musk and his minion trump care NOTHING about the Veterans. He made that known when he called us, and I\nquote, “losers and suckers”\nI can tell you this, if anyone attempts to screw with our disability ratings you will have a war on your hands.\nThanks for tackling this mess at the VA. Ad a 100% disabled veteran I am willing to help out any way possible to get the VA back to a Premier agency. Sgt. Joseph Vary\nCollins is not being honest. They fired 1,000 employees. Just heard that they are rehiring 12 that were fired because they work on the Veteran crisis center.\nYou lost me at embedded subtitles. Back in the 80’s, TVs started including a button to turn on subtitles IF you want them. Online video sites like the one this is hosted on (YouTube) ran with that OPTIONAL subtitle button. And yet, so many places now force embed subtitles, completely eliminating people’s choice in favor of pandering to a subset of people who require or insist upon their ever presence. And yes I understand they help those with hearing issues or are in a loud workplace. That’s the target audience for the ON option of the subtitle button, give their freedom of choice back, and mine too. So no thanks, I will not watch your words dance in my peripheral vision while you speak. Write it in an article and save the bandwidth.\nAll you 2-4 year slackers can just relax. Stop bad mouthing our President and the efforts he is making to fix the damage the democrats have done. The cuts were long overdue to get rid of the lazy people at the VA that don’t want to do their fair share of the work. Once they get workers in those positions the care will improve. As a combat vet, I am embarrassed by some of the comments from the low life bad mouthing of the administration. Maybe that’s why you aren’t getting the care you think you deserve. Straighten up.\nThanks for giving the fact straight up. That’s how we like it\nAs a suggestion, I am a disabled veteran in Crawford county Pennsylvania, we got a new CBOC last year, just ten years after receiving a new one. When I asked about this I was told we will get another new one in ten more years, why? If upgrades are necessary, which I don’t really see any in this facility, but if they are, why not spend a quarter of the money improving the existing facility? How much could the VA save by doing this rather than constantly building new facilities? Use some of those savings to help improve the lives of vets decreasing medical costs, and thus creating even more savings? Just a thought\nANYBODY! that condones Trumps action is a LOSER! According to Trump, we, as Vets, are losers. This idiot, has to go.\nMr. Secretary, Trump and his minions have shown repeated disrespect to Veterans, both living and dead. For you to tell us that you envision no cuts to the VA programs, you are either a polyanna or you must be living in a cave. I look for them to cut some of the allowable meds, terminate the Community Care Program, to institute co-pays, and to make it more difficult for Vets to be granted disability. If I’m wrong, Mr. Secretary, I will apologize.\nThanks for that. I appreciate the “real” news straight from the source.\nUSA\nPlease respond to Sen. Warner’s and Sen. Kaine’s comments that veterans are the major work force in the federal government and will be the majority of those fired. Thank you.\nAs a retired Air Force vet with multiple VA claim denials, I’m so saddened and yet happy to see all the Vets on here posting their anger towards a department that is supposed to protect us and provide support.\nKnowing that my fellow veterans are angry and fed up with the current “administration” is a great first step and a group that can lead the way in clearing house. Please don’t lose momentum in this fight.\nYou don’t fire doctors, nurses, and hospital staff, thus causing appointments to be cancelled and ORs shutdown and then tell us it’s gonna be good. You are hurting us.\nI did not hear a denial that the CBO proposals are not going to be implemented. Paying for tax cuts for the wealthy on the backs of veterans is just wrong! A folksy video that seemed devoid of facts is not convincing.\nSo thankful to have veterans in our family, that use the VA services. We go to Hines in IL….grate for good care there.\nI wouldn’t trust Doug Collins with the health car of a snail! He is an unqualified tRump appointee and his only loyalty is to tRump, not veterans!\nDisgusting. You’re a disgrace to the uniform, spreading these lies on behalf of a man who just today declared himself king. The veterans posting about DOGE illegally firing them aren’t fake, but you are. Again, you’re a disgrace and so is every other enabler of this budding dictatorship. Sic semper tyrannis.\nDid they cut the VR&E benefits during Biden Admin. I got declined twice, been out of work, asked for assistance a 3rd time, was put in VR&E Independent Living Services and they sent me all these little medical contraptions that don’t really help with big issues. Asked about ILS grants to modify bathroom and widen doorways and my VRC said they don’t have a contract with any Contractor to do that so I could not get help with that.\nI applied for VR&E employment education & training, but was put in ILS? I even asked if I could get help with starting my own small Veteran owned business since VRC opined to not send me to school, and got denied on that too. Just got letter from VRC that says 6 months into ILS now they closing VR&E ILS case. Will the new VA Secretary review recent VR&E program denials?\nI’ll just be sitting here for a couple years before anyone gives a response? Very used to that, months and years. This is why private health insurance is a better option, when someone can afford it, V.A. wait times are absolutely ridiculously too long. It’s a broken system, and a good reason to never let Congress promote nationwide government Healthcare, cause that means civilians would see how Vets die from service-connected issues while waiting to be seen by a V.A. doctor\nThe VA should not be giving credibility to DOGE. Transparency? Who’s in charge of Doge? Who are the employees of Doge? Where is their government contact and security clearance? Why don’t we have the names and faces of these people?\nI am glad that you are at the helm Doug. I am confident that you will clean up the mess. I have a few concerns about the process and the contractors. Good Luck\nThanks to Sec. Collins for his support of all us Veterans\nI am glad that you are at the helm Doug. I am confident that you will clean up the mess. I have a few concerns about the process and the contractors that are reviewing my claim. Good Luck\nI don’t trust anything this administration has to say about not cutting veterans benefits. We already have a hard time getting appointments and they firing employees so how can we trust in this administration.\nThat isn’t what the budget plan from Congress says. Mr. Vought and the OMB are trying to cut funding. VFW, DAV, and PVA are advocating on our behalf while our leader ensures we don’t display any pride flags; a blatant display of disrespect to our LGBTQ family members and Veterans. Every single service member, regardless of lifestyle or preference, deserves respect and LDRSHIP.\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins ;\nThank you, Secretary Collins, for your message assuring us that our VA benefits are safe. While I did not believe the Democrat’s or the media’s claims to the contrary, your message confirms my belief in President Trump, the Republican party, and your support in America’s veterans.\nLouis W McClure\nVietnam Veteran\nI don’t trust anything this administration has to say.\nIf DOGE is working on saving money, where are the forensic auditors, and why did they hire hackers?\nI want a REAL explanation of what’s going on without NONSENSE commentary about “media” or “mainstream media” bullcrap. Say it straight or I don’t care what you have to say.\nPlease look into VES, contract service, It is for the contractor to make a profit and have no way helping vets… They can make a appointment 30 days out, the vet has to live by a contractor’s schedule. Let’s make the VA about the Vet and not about a contractor making a profit.\nI’ve never seen a secretary veterans affairs sound like a snake oil salesman until now. WOW\nPlease allow dental care through the Care in the Community program. Dental insurance has limited coverage, minimal (50%) reimbursement and is very expensive (over $50 per month for Delta Dental). Allow veterans dignity and oral health via fillings, crowns, bridges and implants that can be provided by a local dentist. May God bless.\nThank you for the update Secretary Collins! I new you would do an excellent job! Can you cancel the new Gov ID program? It’s the same one the IRS uses and I don’t feel safe giving them that info. Besides the VA should take its own ID for me to log into my healthy vet to message my doc or order my meds.\nThe best way to stop this madness is to tell the men and women of the armed forces who volunteered and served honorably that they will not receive the VA benefits checks at the end of each month.\nAny way the docket can be moved along more readily for disability appeals? Retired in 2020 and still waiting.\nI have found VA Workers to be professional, kind. and hard working. Sometimes I am ashamed at the treatment they are given by other Veterans. While I did my duty to our country, It is you and the people serving under you we Vets need to thank “for your services” to us.\nIf you tie your performance and that of the agency to Trump and DOGE then you are immediately suspect\nWhat’s being done about appointments? I’ve been trying to get an appointment since September 2024 for my back pain and only get the run around when I call.\nThis guy is a bootlicking Trump syncophant. If you think for one second they’re not coming for your benefits you’re crazy.\nWhat about the VA employees that were fired? Most of them were veterans, I would appreciate it if you were hones and just stated the facts that Trump does not respect us. He has yet to apologize for stating that the CMH, id the same as the Presidential Medal Of Freedom\nWhen are you going to support the Service Dog Insurance Benefit? It’s time has come. Research proves the value of these special animals to veterans.\nWe all hope and pray that you are a man of your word. We have been wronged before.\nI want the real truth my husband has been gone going on 2 years I am trying to get his disability he was at 70% when he passed I guess they are wanting to wait and see if I pass away so they don’t have to deal with me I need help !\nWhat about my Health-E-Vet?\nHistorically, this President and his hand packed, unqualified stoogies, have a history of lying. Time will tell…same crap of blaming the media. The media so far has been correct on what they said a 2nd term of Trump would look like.\nAbsolutely thank you for clearing that up I’m a veteran receiving veteran benefits and it’s all I have think the good Lord and the government but this news is a bunch of bull crap so thank you for clearing that up and I appreciate everything you guys are doing thank you\nApparently, the VA is already cutting it’s own expenditures. I’ve had my classification and cut-off figure changed and for the second consecutive year, the VA is attempting to downgrade me to having to pay co-pays on my medications. With the meds I’m on, this would come to $400/month that would have to come out of my food budget, because that’s the only ‘budget’ we have. It seems that we manage to be just a few dollars over the adjusted cutoff every year. For over 20 years this has not been the case but now, with the budget shortfall, we’re suddenly being squeezed.\nIt has been two half years since the Camp Lejeune Pact Act was signed.I found\nout today my claim(lawsuit) will more than likely be the first of next year.I can not believe there are only four judges for 450,000 claims something needs to be done.All of these Veterans are waiting is the govt just waiting for them to die off?\nThe 10.8 million dollars of the Pact Act funds the higher up V.A. used for a raise 136 people I was told they did re coup 97% of the funds. Is there a new IG to contact?\nThey have no business being in any government computers. Is this the largest beach of data in US history.\nYou need to contact your congressional representatives and senators like I did. The problem with the PACT Act IRT Campaign LeJeune H2O contamination is it did little to set out the parameters for compensation. Whereas the VA established clear cut criteria for benefits and eligibility, the Dept of the Navy has not, and they are letting the courts establish those criteria. As you probably already know, this is going to take a long time, and frankly the evidence trail for people like my parents and myself who were exposed from the 50s to the 80s is ridiculously hard to come by. My dad already passed away. My mom’s in her 90s. Many like them, will pass on before these issues get resolved without additional legislation. Don’t wait on the VA.\nThe IGs have been fired\nNo! President Bone Spurs fired all the IGs. He wants free reign to disassemble democracy and not be accountable.\nThey being doing that for years. Why do you think Agent Orange took forever to be in lists for claimable things?\nThe money available is in the Billions, not millions. Payouts are anywhere from $25,000 to one million per veteran. I don’t know what determines the amount the veteran gets.\nI dont believe a damn word. Your wannabe orange king doesn’t give a damn about dead vets, hurt vets, captured vets… he said it himself.\nThe fact you even have to say anything about benefits is indication of bs.\nI agree 100% on them waiting on us to die. I’ve had my claim in since 1970 and can’t get anyone to do anything. Are they going to check on past claims? I certainly hope so!\nHate to burst your bubble but you need to know the truth. When Collins says they are clearing cases quickly, that means they are denying them. And then the appeals process begins. It’s been 10 years now for me with an 1151 case. (malpractice) You know what your case file looks like after several appeals (for bad info) looks like after a dozen of people have looked through your case and commented? You probably do if you’ve ever looked at the notes in your medical records after a visit. The amount of incorrect info is staggering. I haven’t given up but I’m assuming now this admin will deny it permanently. I doubt I live to see it. I pray all of you will eventually see positive results but it might be decades down the road, if ever under this administration. It absolutely is deny until death.\nI know it takes a great deal of time due to the fact that only 4 Judges hearing cases. I was finally approved after waiting more than a year. benefits were back dated and paid on when I filed. Once you are in the system it works great. I now have 100% of my health care taken care of at a VA facility and got a large lump sum settlement and my monthly tax free check is on my bank account on the 1 st of every month.\nIs there a way to contact your office directly with correspondence or is this the only 2 way communication?\nSir, will you ask Pres. Trump to please sign an Executive Order authorizing and directing the VA to finally recognize the harmful health effects from K2-Uzbekistan radiation as presumptive service-connected conditions? As you know, the serious issue of K2 radiation has remained unresolved now for over 23 years. Further, the 2022 PACT Act failed to adequately address K2 radiation. We, the disabled Veterans of K2 appreciate your and Pres Trump’s support in this critical healthcare matter Sir. We believe at this juncture that an Executive Order is the most appropriate and expedient means to finally address the K2 radiation issue. Thank you very much Sir for your time and consideration.\nI’m the spouse of a 100% service connected disable veteran that served 12 years and in the Persian Gulf War and they VA still has not added me as his dependant nor can I get my ChampVA until I’m recognized as his dependant. Who can I contact to help get this completed? I need medical insurance. It’s been almost 5 months!\nWhat I find disturbing is the constant praising of Trump and the dig at main stream media. That pretty much sums everything up. If it quacks like a duck… Say goodbye to your bennies, my fellow combat vets. This administration doesn’t care about us.\nGood luck to all of you vets that have remote doctors that are filling in because nobody wants to work in your local clinic or they can’t get good ones to come there..or they guess the previous one..when they force good doctors to leave the VA because of some stupid mandate to be in an office. Lol. As a vet I feel horrible for you. Good luck and God bless.\nGood luck to all of you vets that have remote doctors that are filling in because nobody wants to work in your local clinic or they can’t get good ones to come there..or they fired the previous one..when they force good doctors and nurses that brought the gap, to leave the VA because of some stupid mandate to be in an office. Lol. As a vet I feel horrible for you. Good luck and God bless.\nsomeone opened a can of worms. good luck\nCome on Mr Hochstetler, you know how this works. ONE way communication. You can try the Secretary’s hotline phone number, which goes right into an automated service and good luck to getting the right operator to connect you to the Secretary’s administrative assistant. Lots of SMOKE SCREEN and GASLIGHTING!\nWhen will the Camp LeJeune Case be funded? Many families have cases filed for years without any answers. Please make this a priority!\nThe Camp LeJeune funds are there. It is only four Judges hearing all of these cases.\nDear Mr. Secretary,\nMany people support efforts to prevent fraud, but veterans with hiring preference working for the VA or other federal agencies—many with over 15 years of service—have been fired. These terminations were not due to poor performance, as claimed, but because they accepted promotions that placed them on a one-year probationary period. As a result, veterans who have sacrificed for their country are losing their jobs, despite the protections meant to support them. These actions are being taken without consideration of the long-term consequences.\nWhat? That’s stupid. I would almost bet that TRUMP don’t know that.\nI’m also concerned about the Camp Lejeune litigation. Delayed justice is denied justice. We deserve justice.\nI am so glad that we finally have a person with our best interest in mind. I’m looking forward new and improved VA and I know all my fellow veterans are too . Thank you Mr Collins .\nDo you know if Trump is committed to assisting more Veterans that have been convicted of felonies since he is also a convicted felon? Can federal employees now also be convicted felons?\nYeah, how about the transparency of firing veterans with double digit years of federal service just because Musk said do it. Is that helping your veterans who happen to be employees too? Stand up for your workforce Sec Collins. I fought for my country and a South African billionaire is making these decisions. So much for my exemplary 18 plus years of federal service with the VA.\nSincerely,\nDisappointed, unemployed disabled vet.\nNuts, as a famous general once said.\nNuts. How many VA staff have been cut?\nHow can we believe anything said by this administration about anything! We are abandoning our allies and doing Putin’s bidding. You are destroying America and your empty promises to protect veterans benefits is laughable while Elon Musk and his lieutenants are the one deciding things.\nThat isn’t what the budget plan from Congress says. Mr. Vought and the OMB are trying to cut funding. VFW, DAV, and PVA are advocating on our behalf while our leader ensures we don’t display any pride flags; a blatant display of disrespect to our LGBTQ family members and Veterans. Every single service member, regardless of lifestyle or preference, deserves respect and LDRSHIP.\nI agreee with you one million percent!!! Thank you!\nEnough with the LGBTQ. Get out of here with that nonsense!\nOur Vet money and efficiency has nothing to do with displaying who you have sex with! we just need to focus on real issues not displaying our sexual preferences to all to see.\nHell yes.\n10/10\nWould protect above commenter in prison.\nTruth’s are better said than lies. With the transgender operations, constant medical attention, Mrs Cross are you going to pay for that medical expenses bill? In the military, at many commands, never cared who was gay, bi, lesbian, during the late 80’s. Don’t ask don’t tell, was a good idea. I do understand about marriage, same rights as a heterosexual would. Why, maybe you can answer this question. Why does the LGBT+ community have to advertise what is done behind their bedroom doors?\nThank you!\nRetired Navy Submariner. Heterosexual. I have a cousin who is gay n married, whom Since being my cousin with a tight knit family( aunts, uncles, cousins from both sides of my parents families.\nThey’re not going to fly my flag, why should they yours?\nWe don’t need to single out people for what goes on in their personal life.\nThe American Ensign and POW flags are the only flags that needs to be flown.\nThose two flags represent everybody.\nWhat about the firing of VA employees during their probationary period. Is this happening as we cut the government? How will this affect our care and services?\nAmen…I’m with you on this. All Veterans means all Veterans.\nLGBQTXYZ, get their recognition on Veterans Day just like the rest of us\nNobody cares about your sexual orientation (or anyone’s). Thank God President Trump (& Secretary Hegseth) has focused our military on doing the job of being a leathal fighting force – not some social engineering experiment on queers.\nLol mental illness\nExactly this. Thank you for saying it so clearly.\nCry me a river ! If you full inclusion why the Hell do you feel that you need a “SPECIAL” LGBTG PREVENTION NUMBER ???Use what all the rest of us use !\nThis is about veterans. Not your lifestyle preferences. You get as much respect as anyone else. Deal with it.\nNo person of sound, rational mind truthfully gives a s*it about the LGBTQ “family.” Have those persons nothing greater to celebrate in their lives than their sexual preferences? If that be the case, what a meaningless, unproductive life they live. Have they accomplished NOTHING greater than deciding who they decide to share orgasm’s with? The entire LGBTQ scene is a disgrace to humanity for celebrating a personal preference that absolutely NO ONE cares about. GMAFB, ms. cross. Bravo Zulu for getting rid of that disgraceful pride flag.\nThank you Mr. Collins for fighting for our right as veterans. We, the one that serve are very grateful to know that the benefits for the veterans are not going to be affected by this new presidential changes. A lots of us depend on the veteran’s benefits.\nThat sounds like fake news. Trump won’t cut veterans benefits unless one of those entities is skimming money off the top. I hope he finds it if it’s there!\nMichelle, #1 Mr Vought and OMB are Cutting waste not Funding where it is needed. #2, I am a Gay man my self.\nI am for What the Standard Norm Was before DEI, the LBGTQAI+++ alphabet that all but ruined the Military with its Demands.

Thank you for having the COURAGE to post your comment. Retired US Navy CDR.\nThe only flags that should be displayed are the U.S. flag, Military branch flags and the P.O.W. flag. No need for anything else.\nThe American flag represents them just like the rest of us veterans. Did these veterans fight for our country under the gay pride flag or the American flag? When I was in Vietnam I fought under the American flag.\nYou are a liar, there are no cuts.\nDear Mr. Secratary\nIt’s my understanding from reading Military.com that President Trump is following recommendations from Project 2025 by the Heritage Foundation. While I agree with rooting out fraud, waste and abuse and think DOGE is doing and excellent job. I am fearful of Veteran’s disability compensation being radically changed! I AM AGAINST ANY REFORM OR CUTS to disability compensation! I am a total and complete 100% disabled veteran and retired! Veteran’s have sacrificed more than any other segment of the American population other than maybe law enforcement. As most retired Vets are on a fixed income any disruption to that income could lead to catastrophic results to include increased homelessness, depression, anxiety and even suicide. Veteran’s have earned every single penny of their compensation and under most circumstances had to fight the bureaucracy tooth and nail to get it in the first place. I beg you please do not vote yes on any bill that would include changing VA disability compensation in any way shape or form. There are PLENTY of other places to cut spending without the continued sacrifice of our Veteran’s. Thank you for your time.\nMichael S Jordahl\nUSA, SFC Ret\nOver one thousand VA probationary employees were fired in the last week as part of DOGE ruining everything we have.\nDon’t sit there any say nothing is being cut. Cutting the workforce is harming veterans.\nAgree..many veterans concerned about means test & 30% getting eliminated. We all followed orders and have the scars visible or not. Contrary to popular opinion, VA disability is NOT an entitlement program.\nI’ve been trying to find more info about the means test. From what I understand capital gains could be counted as income. So if a vet bought stock and wanted to sell it to pay off a house or buy a fancy new car it could actually cancel their benefits! If the means test comes true they could use 2025 tax info.\nMilitary.com is owned and operated by Gannett. The same people who operate USAToday. They may have military in the name but they are no more reliable than USAToday. I would take anything there with a grain of salt. And if someone is appealing to my sense of fear? They are probably trying to con me.\nHard pass.\nDon’t believe you.\nHe full of sh-t just like trump. He is lying to our face just like his boss trump. This guy is has no honor, respect and honesty every time him or his boss president elon / trump open their mouth is lies. He and his bosses trying to bring back BS choice program which is garbage. I used it before and it was nothing but garbage and I could have had everything I needed done by the in half the time it took with choice and they still never got it done right. No wonder the VA got rid of it before under president Biden. Trump ruins everything he touches like the VA. Leave the VA alone you can’t fix what is not broken and trump does not fix anything so stay of the VA system!!!!\nInspectors General are how you root out fraud, waste, and abuse, not by having people with no concept of how the government works take a hammer to things they don’t understand. Audits are done with forensic accountants and subject matter experts. Elon has a bunch of JR tech bros, one of which was fired from a previous job for giving away company secrets. Btw, Trump fired all the IGs.\nI wish I could shake your hand. That was the best way to say what all us vets are thinking as I sit in a hospital bed right now due to my injuries.\nI think they should cut it all including the Vet benefits THIS IS WHAT WAS VOTED FOR! so let’s see it through.\nDo let us know how that goes. I expect him to swoop in at any time since he really will need your vote again.\nYou haven’t been paying attention: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/john-kelly-confirms-trump-privately-disparaged-us-service-members-vete-rcna118543\nYou’re getting exactly what you voted for, and we tried to warn all of you this would happen. Congrats. You voted against yourselves.\nFine words – but why all the layoffs? Don’t be too surprised when they try to privatize the VA.\nSo, it’s ok for others’ income to be affected. Just not yours. Maybe they served their country honorably as well.\nIf you think DOGE is doing an excellent job then you shouldn’t be surprised when DOGE finds a lot of fraud at the VA that results in reduced or suspended payments, or worse, for veterans like yourself. DOGE has successfully eliminated programs and employees we once thought were indispensable. They’ve already fired 1000+ VA employees. They will be heading to the VBA with the same intent.\nThey need to revamp the disability requirements. Too much glorified welfare. It should be LOD only.\nYou need to send your letter (comment) to your senators and house rep. The head of the VA doesn’t vote on bills. That’s congress’s job.\nYou deserve to be cut off if you think they’re doing a “wonderful job.”\nSo veterans being fired in huge numbers from federal employment is fine because it doesn’t directly affect you?\nThese firings includes nurses and people at the veteran’s crisis hotline, which will affect vets using VA Health Care facilities and those suffering from PTSD or other mental health issues. We either care about vets or we don’t – it shouldn’t matter how it affects us individually.\nCollins is just another suck-up, yes man for Trump.\nYou support Trump and DOGE yet fear having your benefits cut. Get real man. It is your support of these guys that will enable the cuts.\nWow! Our personal information is at risk of being exposed to hostile actors, DOGE is, was, and continues to be a front used to create mistrust in our government agencies, and hard working ‘Mericans are losing their jobs as part of a failed attempt to balance a budget consistently and historically ruined by the GOP…and still there are those that support this type of nonsense. Except when it applies to them. Let’s see who continues to support what, as access to all of our traditional social services are slashed or elimated so those pesky tax cuts don’t expire.\nI’m with you my brother!\nAmen! My husband is a 100% Disabled USMC Vietnam Veteran. He’s been on the poisoned water national list since about 2007. He was told back then if there ever would be money, he would be entitled. When the lawsuit started, we contacted our present attorney. They know how long he’s been on this list.\nWow. Then you just care about your benefits and nothing else Trump and Musk are doing to destroy this country from within?\nElections have consequences, I’ll have to accept what comes with it.\nYes you want the cuts…but not to anything that will affect you. As a disabled vet I also do not, but you somehow think that as long as it does not affect you, its okay to cut them. Im sorry that you lack compassion and empathy for others….which is what the men in charge suffer from as well. You do not think that others losing their jobs are facing catastrophic results to include increased homelessness, depression, anxiety and even suicide. Shame on you. The man in charge will not be reading your comment….he has better things to do than care for veterans.\nHow is DOGE doing a good job? It’s not even an official federal agency. They are terminating essential workers on false pretenses and claims, causing chaos, destruction, anxiety, and hardship on regular working class people. This entire administration is a coup and whoever they elect to oversee programs, including the VA, they are only minions who follow every unconstitutional law given to them and disregard ethical policies that were put in place only to overturn them and eventually cut standard benefits to veterans and civilians alike. It’s only a matter of time when they start looking at va disability benefits and the recipients who are receiving those benefits. They definitely have access to our personal data and healthcare records. They don’t care about veterans. And why would they, especially Musk!\nThe Sec Def. Has no vote on anything. When Trump and muskrat come for our disability, there is nothing Clins can or will do about it.\nConsider than less than 1% of payments were erroneous in the last 7 years according to the IG, DOGE isn’t doing a good job: it’s a farce to distract from their egregious behavior\nYes, I’m STILL fighting this battle. It is absurd the amount of crap we have to navigate through, wait over a year just to be told no, didn’t happen in the military. Then, it is up to us to hire a lawyer to help fight it. This whole process works against the veterans.\nthere is a concerted attempt to privatize VA Healthcare; the vipers want to convert it into private and for-profit un-healthcare of the sort that exists in the private sector. VA Healthcare in my expereince is far superior to the private system and for a simple reason: inside the VA Healthcare system people are there to help people and not to make profits. I’ve heard that comment from many physicians and nurses who have worked in both.\nMr. Collins doesn’t give a tinkers damn about veterans. He works for Musk and Fat Donnie the Fascist King. I expect that by 2027 the new American King aided by the NAFP, New American Fascist Party will have so decimated our system of government that even our military and those who have suffered and died will become meaningless. In my opinion Trump and Musk plan on dividing the world up three ways. China, Russia, and the U.S. will each control 1/3 of the globe. My question to Collins is WHAT THE HELL are you going to do about it?? Do you even care? Are you simply overseeing the dismantling of the Agency designated to provide care and assistance for those of us who served our Nation? I believe that you’re the chosen sucker. After your mission is complete you WILL be tossed aside like a box of garbage. You Sir are a fool. May God save your soul…..if you have one.\nGood Man ! ?\nHis lips are moving, he’s a republican, he lying while some unelected billionaire technocrat robs us all blind. Faster case fliw? That means they are denying us.\nDear Secretary Collins, I am amazed that veterans are being let go from the VA. I see many of those veteran types working at the VA hospital in Decatur Georgia and I would hate to see them lose their jobs because of some fanatical, cutting efforts by this administration. I hope you will take action to preserve, the opportunities that veterans have to serve other veterans in our VA facilities.\nI agree Captain. When I worked at a VAMC, I saw more non-vets who were a waste of a position. Their attitude was, “after my years probation I cant be fired”. Many non-vet employees live by that code at VAs.\nBeen bothering me also.\nIt is too late. They have fired all probationary employees with no reason with a note in their termination letter saying they were fired due to underperformance, and that is just the beginning unfortunately. They are also making cuts to Medicare which all tricare for life recipients ultimately transfer over to. Anyone who thinks this will not hurt veterans are not thinking clearly and assuming this guy is being honest will be severely disappointed.\nLiars, all of you. Letting are constitution fail while you watch.\nI completely agree with your comments and feedback. The same thing is going on in Florida, VA regional in West Palm Beach. Right in the PODUS’s Winter White House backyard. You would think King Trump and the Secretary would preserve these low paying jobs since it is already extremely difficult to recruit qualified personnel that understands the unique administrative, physical, mental, spiritual, and financial needs required by our military personnel. Just try to explain your situation to a civilian network provider. They just want their money for services!\nI completely agree with your comments and feedback.

What about our Democracy, and all those Vets, including my grandfather, who fought and died for it, against Fascism in WWII. Now you embrace it. After all of the lies that Republicans have told to me in my lifetime, I would not believe anything more that you ever have to say. I became a United States Marine and I am still a Patriot but You support Billionaires over someone like me. Money is your God. So far there has been zero benefit for my service but then I chose honor\nand principle over money. A love of my Nation. Unlike you. I don’t count on you helping any of us. There has been no Justice for the loss of my child at Camp Lejuene. No Justice for anything. I hope that you believe in a Just God, I do. Men like you are going to answer for all of it at Judgement. You still believe in your lies and have zero repentance, no change from your sins. Cuddle with a dictator for worldly wealth and status out of fear. Refuse to help the least of your brothers. Play God in your decisions. No better than those who murderered the Jews. No better than those who condemned Christ to death. No forgiveness from the Lord God. Unforgiven.\nYou are a clown ?. Crawl back to your Circus\nUnlike the ungrateful comments that support the previous missing in chief, i feel its wonderful that we are rooting out fraud and waste. Even if that means laying off VA employees. In fact, it would be cheaper to issus us a card accepted by outside doctors and hospitals for community care.\nWhat did the last 4 years of Biden get you? Go ahead I’ll wait.\nI have to admit, there is a lot of truth to what this person is saying. The mega men and women in Congress and the Senate have violated their oath to the constitution. They have turned their backs on democracy and have supported a traitor, a felon and a hollow man, and just like him they have no moral compass, no values and no character.\nHistory will be especially hard on these people, and any veteran who has his sense of self will be willing to go through the last full measure to ensure that these people never rise to the top.\nI served in the US Army and am a 100% disabled Veteran. This is the most heartfelt, brutally honest, beautiful way I have heard someone describe what the unabashed sledgehammering of our Constition, our Democracy, our lack of ethics and compassion is doing to the very fabric of our existence. I beg of you to share this beyond here. It needs to be read by the people. And if you don’t want to do it or remain anonymous, I would be honored, as one battle buddy to another, to share this with others.\nSorry I don’ t believe you sir and DOGE, Elon & Trump can all go to hell.\nHere are things that need to change at the VA. I have been going to the N.Texas VA in Dallas for over 25 years. The doctors there have almost killed me 3 times, and it is all in my medical records. 1. Stop hiring unqualified foreign doctors. The Dallas VA is full of them. 2. Make it easy for Vets to get outside medical help, when we can’t get it at the VA. The way it works now, and the way it is set up, is a total nightmare. I have diabetes and I’m on blood thinners. The orthopedic doctors will not see me half the time. I need a shot in my knee every 6 months so my knee will not grind bone on bone. They have refused to see me the last three times I have ask. This has got to stop. These doctors are there to help us, not turn us down. 3. The service we get at the Dallas VA is shocking. I just told you about one problem. There is many more. The Dallas VA is good at covering their tracks on problems like these.. We need a lot of changes at the VA in Dallas.\nYour left wing liberalism hate is showing. President Trump and Mr. Musk, no matter how much money they have, are trying to save America. Do you live in a cave? Have you not seen all the wast that they have found? If they don’t fix it. You want have to worry about the VA, America will be broke and there won’t be a VA. The U.S. Government now employees over 50% or the working population. We can’t have that. The government was NEVER suppose to be that large. The government should never employ more than 38% MAX. I suggest you crack a book and learn the truth and get off of CNN and MSNBC.\nHear, hear! I’m surprised that the censor allowed your comment. They’re blocking mine. They’re afraid of “dangerous” ideas being seen by other, like Orwell’s 1984. Thanks, Big Brother!\nWow, this country was founded as a constitutional republic and the democracy you speak of was formed within the republic to turn the country into a corporation. So I will ask you take the blinders off and do little more research. Both parties have failed this country and some of the rotten leadership have been in office for decades. But don’t take a word I say to heart I just ask you to do you due diligence and research. Not everyone is bad or has bad intentions, and if these people don’t do good for us then I will join you in the tinfoil hats brigade and vote in some new that will more then like replace and repeal all that being done this time around. But there is moving to another country. I even have researched if this country fails US like I have experienced in the last 3 years cause I when from 70% in late 2020 to be to 90% in early 2021 to 60% in summer of 2022. So tell me how Mr. Collins is the problem\nPerfectly said!!! So very sorry for the loss of your child.\nThis is the same guy that said the VA “will not be cutting any employees.” So I agree with you 100%, I can’t trust this dude either.\nOh, really.\nWell Said. I couldn’t of said it better myself!\nFirst of all, thank you for your service. Secondly, your comments are so out of touch with reality. President Trump very much respects our servicemen and women, and if it weren’t for him and serving as our President 4 years ago, our VA health system would still be in dire straights. He fixed a broken system, and now our Veterans are receiving better care. Please do your research.\nDidn’t the Jews kill Jesus? You must be a troll op on the Internet, but cool story though, Bot.\nYes! I agree with everything you stated! Lip service as vets lose their jobs! Pathetic they will answer for all their stuff!\nHi J Medley. First I am so sorry for the loss of your child at Camp Lejuene. There have been a lot of injustices in our country, and long wait times to get claims finalized etc. but in all seriousness you can’t blame that on any one party. Your remarks about Trump and our new Secretary are so wrong on many levels. You are simply spewing what the liberal media have been dishing out for so many years trying to eliminate Trump from becoming President. Look back – two assassination attempts, two impeachments, endless lawsuits, special hearings etc. – All failed. Millions and maybe billions of taxpayer dollars spent on trying to derail the man. I’ve been in politics so I know the game. I have to close that you are in no place to think God is on your side and against Trump and the Republican party. Despite what you think Trump really wants to make this country great again. I get the fact his personality may rub you the wrong way but give the man a chance. Since you seem to be a Godly man, put him in your prayers that he does a great job for everyone. Have faith and hope he does the right thing!!!! Best to you and yours, a Vietnam Vet\nYou’ve bought into the propaganda, “Trump Bad” is the mantra. If there is any “fascism” it’s in the Democrat Party, the self proclaimed Socialist. I feel for you brother, please open your eyes to the truth –> “Trump GOOD.”\nAlthough you have a right to express your opinion, this rant does not possess one ounce of facts to support the accusations. This extremist approach does absolutely nothing but cause unfounded division. Stick to the facts, keep an open mind, and read a variety of news sources to create a more balanced viewpoint.\nBy the way, there are worse tyrants throughout history than the recent dictator in which was referred. At least try to spice it up a little with some ancient Roman, Chinese, Russian, or Mongolian oppressors. Continually comparing others with the same old name is unimaginative. ;)\nYou are blaming this administration, how about the previous administrations?\nYou are very misled, but I can tell you for certain that under the Biden administration my benefits went to hell. My prescription drug copay almost doubled, and I couldn’t/can’t even make an appointment with my primary care doctor without going through some stupid person that doesn’t even work in that office. I don’t know where you get your information, but you have no idea what you are talking about. You sound like an idiot with the crap you are spewing.\nYou’re just an America Hating Sheep that believes Everything the Lying Fake News Tells you !!\nAmen! My ancestors fought in the American Revolution and most wars since. This administration has no idea what they have done but they will soon. I don’t think there will be a civil war because this isn’t between civilians ( except the “cult”) but the oppressed will rise up and show the billionaires the error of their ways. History is on our side. 1776.\n“I’m the Secretary of VA, and I’m telling you right now, that’s not happening… the reality is, Veterans benefits aren’t getting cut,” Collins said. … “I’m happy to partner with DOGE [an un-elected organization that was not created by the US Congress as the VA or USAid was, just an arm of Elon Musk’s business empire] to find things we need to get rid of…” he said.”\nWhat BS, first Collins says he’s not cutting VA benefits…then he says, oh yes, by the way I am cutting benefits, we’re just calling it “efficiency”…literally on the same page!\nSecretary Collins is just a stooge for Musk, our N- co-president from South Africa. He is appointed ‘secretary’ to take an axe to the VA benefits we EARNED by our sacrifice. Trump, a Vietnam draft dodger, has never respected veterans and does not honor our service. To Trump and Musk, we are just “suckers” (Trump actually said this!). Wake up people, this is all in the project 2025 playbook. Musk-Trump wants to kill the VA dead so that we have to deal with their golfing buddies/ vultures who own the private health insurance industry. All while betraying our allies in NATO and selling Ukraine to the Soviets. RIP America 2025.\nJ Meadly Sir, Seems you’re looking to blame certain individuals for the loss of your child. Many lost loved ones concerning the Lejeune issues and or continue to suffer. There is never true Justice after suffering a loss as yours. We do need to heal and as in the Marines, continue to move forward.. I do strongly suggest you seek counseling. The VA has the means and am certain would like to speak with you. Good Luck.\nWell put my friend!\nI agree with you 100%. I was at LeJeune as well. I am so deeply sorry for your loss. Good lord above. ?\nAll of this feels like a full on tail spin. It takes cptsd to a whole entirely different level! And the Veteran’s suicide hotline has already had some operators cut! As if their jobs aren’t absolutely necessary. And they wonder why vets isolate. What a joke-what a slap in the face!! I WILL pray for you and your family.\nWell said My Brother, well said!\nI created the Desert Storm Battle Registry as a survey in 1997 to\nfind my fellow GWI veterans. More than 5,000 filled this out. Then\nI progressed to full advocacy by 1998. By then DOD knew me quite\nwell as I inventoried there servers and threw it back at them. I was tired\nof not knowing anything or why I was so damn sick.\nDSBR name tags, and name plates began to fill boxes from events that\nI was recognized at. Media was easy back then. No one turned me away.\nTill global media coverage in 2003 opposing troops going to Iraq. Even\nhad a DC PO Box for mail.\n2008, got my own VA federal advisory committee. VA went out of its way\nto shorten our tenure and muzzle us. Even threaten me, then pretty\nmuch hide our committee and its final report.\n2012 VA cut us all off. Played dirty with gulf war advocates. Ran off our\nadvocates in favor of ringers. All the while making things worse for Gulf\nwar vets and playing up Deployment Health. Who have been hiding 4\nsignificant disease trends from the veterans and the public.\nHere it is 2025 and Im still here. Out lived hundreds of advocates and\nfellow supporters. Still, DSBR hung on for 28 long years. Of which VA\nhas gotten very braisen. Not posting my letters to the RAC year after\nyear likes its a choice. Taking down all evidence I exist the last 3 years.\nI find it highly offensive 14 Secretaries of VA have ignored everything Gulf\nwar from a veterans stand point. That we have no real say in our care,\nbenefits, and healthcare. You will choose for us. None of you have done\nright by me, or the 697,289 other fellow GWI vets. Going all the way back to\nPL 105-368 that you twisted and abused.\nMust be very comforting to look down your nose, and act like DSBR does not\ndeserve professional courtesy. 28 years of work means nothing. What could I\npossibly offer versus you? Try 28 years of experience and dealing with 13 other\nSec of VA that like you felt veterans input is a joke. Every damn one of them was\na public servant and forgot that when it office. Your supposed to be available.\nTechnically, Im your boss. Not the other way.\nSo I will say to you what Ive been saying back in the Army to officers. How could\nyou loose what you never earned, my respect. You demand it, then you treat me\nlike a feral dog in back ally. You want my respect now, earn it by doing your job.\nWhich means answering phones and emails. So far, zip there. DSBR came along\nway before you, and Ive helped far more gulf war vets than you ever will.\nWe started out nice 2 weeks ago, and now I know 2025 is you cutting throats,\nhiding behind staff, pretending to care while you pretty much spit in my face.\nBlocking my browser access to VA.gov is also blocking me from MyHealthevet\nwebsite. Your denying me access to medical care. Real brave, real smart. So I\nthink Im justified to be grumpy with you. I only get this way reacting to others,\nI didnt start this. Just reached out to you and you blew me off..\nChange is coming either way.\nKirt P. Love\nDirector, DSBR\nFormer Member VA ACGWV\nDidn’t you hear? https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/john-kelly-confirms-trump-privately-disparaged-us-service-members-vete-rcna118543\nEat [redacted], fascist.\nThank you, what they don’t want us to know is the fact most Vets of Desert Storm are like myself. We were some how connected to a Bradley Fighting Vehicle or M1 ABRAMS, or some other mechanized source. The US Army conducted a study in 1981 on the two tanks mentioned. This study revealed that just firing of the weapons alone Carbon Monoxide was lethal at every position within those tanks. The DOD, and Army refused to do anything about it other than ignore it. Myself I have suffered from Rumathoid Arthritis every since Desert Storm I was 11M. I enlisted at 17 fresh out of High School healthy as an OX. Thru my own studies and research there is a known link to CO poisoning and Rumathoid Arthritis. I have a TERA MEMO attached to my file and conceded to by the VA, but none of that matters, it’s just a piece of paper. Come sit with me some times when it takes all I got to get out of bed because of the pain I am in. I have accepted the fact that RA is chronic and it will take my life someday if a cure is not f going. What I can’t accept is the very Government I defended and would do it again in a heart beat as most of us would, now I’m having to defend myself because nobody with Authority has the balls to stand up and do the right thing for us Vets. It’s always some other law it more red tape, I didn’t recall any of that when I was called to fight a War we really had no business fighting in the first place! Mad as hell at Army,DOD, and now the VA is falling right in step with those two. Grow a pair do right by the very people who gave you a job to begin with or resign and put me in that seat!\nThey may turn a blind eye, but we are still watching. Thank you for the advocacy over the years, Kirt. GWI (or whatever they want to call it) has been a nightmare for so many.\nYou have my undying respect and admiration Kirt. I also had to voice my displeasure to superiors while serving which didn’t serve me well. You seem to have the ability to voice your opinion and stop. My mind demands my adrenaline push me beyond that and display a much firmer view for my point of view.\nU.S. Army Vietnam Vet\nWell over 80% disabled and find the VA extremely lacking to the point I’m convinced I’m just a photo op.\nPlease focus on the Caring for Survivors Act as so many of us lost not only our loved one but also a substantial amount of our income\nYou want the VA to focus on the survivers moreso than the actual veterans? Many veterans are single and single with families and cannot work but yet you feel that its more importants for the non-veterans to get the disabilty that the actual veterans need? Im sorry you lost a substantial amount of your income but I lost the ability to have children because of military issues among other issues so Im not losing an additional income..Im losing most of my income, my home, and may be facing living on the streets if they cut the benefits. I WAS in the military, not just married to someone in it. PS…when I could not have kids my military husband left me to find someone that could.\nCurrently VA has over a quarter of a million pending rating cases, which is taking an average of 140 days to complete. Is that faster than ever? Historically, VA has staffed up during wartime periods but when those employees retire service suffers. Veterans’ needs for VA services do not go away after they are discharged. Many times as veterans age, their needs for disability benefits and health care increases. It angers me that Elon Musk and his wunderkind, none of whom served one day in the military, are attacking the VA. Shame!\nThis empire was built off of the blood of those who served in units like mine, and you better f***king know that we are not oblivious to you trying to f**k with our disability ratings and services. Keep that in mind. You can lie to the masses with the current administration’s lies, but you won’t pull that s**t with us vets. Remember that.\nLess w 0ke Culture? As a nurse you dedicate your career to helping those you serve. Us veterans are very diverse and come from all ends of this country to serve and you should respect that. So if providing them with w 0ke services is what is required to help THEM it shouldn’t be your voice who dictates what they need.\nA lot of vets voted for this admin. So the wool has been pulled over their eyes and quite easily, unfortunately.\nI second that!\nSadly, some of these Vets are delusional and have fallen into the cult.\n!!! You speak the truth, unfortunately\nIf one comment from here could get the attention of anyone in a position of authority at the VA, let it be Mr. Hirth’s.\nStick your hand in our cage and pull back a stump.\nHow is freezing hiring for the WARTAC program, and taking medical services away while lowering disability ratings “giving and improving services.” You can’t BS us. We are what sustains this empire. Active or reserved… You’d do well to remember that.\nI don’t believe a word the Sec. is saying. He’s just another puppet of this administration & the so called “DOGE”. I’m very worried about the outcome of all this stupity and the future of our USA. Take care & carry on.\nSecretary Collins ,\nI don’t believe your going to read any of these emails. I’ve reached out to Congress the VA representative, and my Congressman in Texas with no results. I’ve had 3 botched surgery’s from incompetent surgeon’s. Now I have to suffer the rest of my life and I don’t trust the VA at all thank god for community care. As far as I’m concerned the Government has given up on us and has given everything to illegals and Fu$k us.\nI will continue to fight for my country and what I believe in\nDear Sir,\nThere are 182 comments on here.Are you going to answer any of them?\nLOL… Don’t hold your breath.\nHe’s not reading them-they don’t care, I promise they don’t. Tomorrow, thousands more will lose their jobs in America while the Felon in charge whines about when he’ll get his new Air Force One delivered—because that is government efficiency:)\nmy brother, he is not even going to read any of them.\nDo you actually think he is going to read them? Sorry your comment was pretty funny. Let me answer you as a disabled veteran. NO, he is not going to answer you. He is probably having his very expensive coffee with his amazing breakfast chatting about how hard his job is and cant decide what kind of furniture he needs for his new office.\nNo, no he is not. But you kinda knew that, didn’t you\nYou wanted this job, now do it\nPlease Exend the Blue Water Line to the original Vietnam Service Medal Line that was took away from Blue Water Navy off Vietnam in 2002. This was the agent orange 1991 Bill for all Vietnam Veterans. I been trying for almost 20 years to get my Benefits. I got a lot of Health Problems from Agent Orange and Toxins on my Ship. I am almost 78 years old.\nMy husband is like you. VA doctors told him to file because certain illnesses, like prostate cancer, he had would be automatic because of Agent Orange. When documentation was filed, weirdly, VA kept saying they didn’t get them. They seemed to get records that were not needed. they also close the case if they don’t get what they want by a certain date. We filed through Texas Vet who took the paperwork and handed it to the VA office and still they wouldn’t acknowledge they received them.\nHow can we possibly believe anything this fascist government says. The president just declared himself king! DOGE was given unrestricted access to records. We have a HHS that wants to put those with mental illness in camps. How can anyone believe this!?\nGreat. Just another bootlicker kissing POTUS butt.\nOne of the slowest entities on this planet is the VA . It takes an average of 6 months to 3 years to get an answer from the VA in disability claims. Molasses going uphill in the winter time on Mount Everest is faster than the VA. Such a disgusting way to treat veterans that literally give their lives for the defense of this great country. And you wonder suicide rates are so high. Veterans have no choice but to give up. It would be nice if one of the largest health care systems in this country could ACTUALLY take care of its veterans. Please pass this on to the VA boss and maybe for ONCE he will ACTUALLY listen to our concerns.\nPeople commenting like he gonna read it lmfao.\nAs I read I wa liked lol. Some are writing a yrs of what they did.\nWe know he’s not going to read them. We know no one on his staff will read them. We know he doesn’t care. The comments are for each other to hear the voices of their compatriots.\nThis is why I would never vote Republican. The sheer stupidity and depravity is an insult to those who served their country. I understand that you rich white scumbags feel that I as a black man can serve and die for my country but I do not deserve to be treated equally. We as black people have fought for this country since its founding and still are treated as second class citizens. Your recent cuts to the VA are yet another example of your disregard for our service. It is my hope that Karma shows how much of a bitch she is. You are led by a 5 time draft dodger who called us suckers and losers, however it is my belief that you are the suckers and losers and I will stand on that until I die…\nAbsolutely. They’re not gonna read any of this stuff, but I’m really enjoying reading what my fellow veterans are saying.\nAwesome! Thanks for posting\nAmen brother!\nAs a white veteran I have to tell you that they don’t care about any veterans no matter what color. I do understand that you may have faced prejudiced issues in the past…so have women, and its not right. About the rest of your comment…I agree totally. Im also nog a fan of old rich scumbags who are robbing us blind to their advantage. That’s why I am up all hours of the night filled with anxiety, depression and questioning if tomorrow they will be coming after us.\nlol shut up, all this garbage has been given to us from all the previous generations Dem and Rep combined working for their globalist overlords have crushed us veterans and made the VA one of the most corrupt institutions on earth, and now all of a sudden 30 days into Trump you’re gonna cry about Republicans and “waaah white people” when the VA has been an institution of death and depravity for the past several decades? Get lost, you’re nothing more than an anti white ideological hack.\nNow you know how my Irish ancestors felt when they were forced off their lands and taken into slavery to serve in the New World. My Celtic brethren were called and treated as sub-Human till 1830s. So been there, done that.\nUp to 20,000 Irish were worked to death to hand dig the New Basin Canal in New Orleans in the 1830s because African slaves were deemed too valuable to risk. In 1862, the US Army project to build a canal on the Mississippi River during the War to bypass Confederate Army batteries on the bluffs of Vicksburg. It was dubbed Grant’s Canal, but after the first failed attempt, that quickly changed to Grant’s Folly. Undeterred, General Grant secured President Lincoln’s approval to force recently “freed” African slaves to hand dig and dredge the adjacent wetlands. It is recorded that 200+ of these men lost their lives for this useless project that was always doomed to failure.\nIn the end, we are all cattle to the powers that be. Race and nationality have little to do with it. Democrats aren’t much different from Republicans. They both belong to the same Progressive Party.\nsounds like this one needs to be audited. Bet your claims are fraudulent\nYou can’t fire (without cause) over 1000 dedicated VA caregivers then pretend you actually give a dam about our health care or convince us that you won’t also come after our disability benefits so greedy never-served billionaires (like Musk) can shove even more billions into their pockets. Trump may hate us “suckers and losers” veterans because (being a pathetic coward) he ain’t us. But WE will outlast him!!\nMr. Secretary,\nSince there gas been a staffing shortage of doctors, nurses, and support staff. Why did you layoff 1000 workers? For transparency “Why are you afraid of Donald Trump? As for Elon and his SpaceX techs. No I highly disapprove of non- or improperly vetted civilians that has no clue whatsoever they are doing to have access to my records or any VA records. To be honest you, Trump, Elon, and Republicans in general are an embarrassment to this country. Elon is from South Africa and not from the US. Having access to all these records and making decisions hurting America’s workers.\nI hope they do away with this glorified welfare system. Unless your disability is LOD you shouldn’t get any. This could save the govt billions. I hope they take a hard look at this.\nwe HAVE to Make America Great Again. There will be pain for sime but I totally support the cuts. there us so much waste and fraud and faking. billions and billions\nHello, my name is Alfonso Perez. A Disabled Combat Veteran in South Texas. Since 2010 I have submitted documents in support of a claim. I was in combat as an Infantryman during the Gulf War. When I was discharged, a clerical error did not show my medals that I deserve and served for. Mainly, my Combat Infantry Badge. This is important to me. I can pass this on to my kids and grandchildren. Showing that I served my Country. For years, I have been fighting the US Army Vital Records Department and Board of Appeals. I have emailed and talked to several offices and departments, hoping to get help in this matter. Mr Collins is the only person that can help me at this point. I also been fighting the VA over my failing and declining health. I have pictures and my statement where I was exposed to the burning oil wells and burning material that we were tasked to do. I have been complaining of shortness of breath, bone and muscle pain from day one. When I filed a disability claim in 2007. Although I am 100% disabled due to combat, I suffer from several illnesses. The VA has helped me in getting an electric wheelchair and a lift for my home. I am bed ridden 90% of the time. My wife has been caring for me the past 3 years. This is when my health has worsened. I applied for the caregiver program, and have been denied several times. There’s been time I want to give up. But my wife motivates me to keep going. PS I also believe my injuries and illnesses should be awarded a Purple Heart. As it was a tactic used by the enemy. God Bless and Thank you!! Alfonso Perez (Mission,Texas) 18th Airborne Division/24th Infantry Division Aco 3rd/7th Ft Stewart Georgia\nBrother, your wife sounds like a saint. I had luck getting my dd214 updated through military awards section of manpower.\nI feel you brother! I did ask about the Purple Heart as well. NBC warfare was used against us on multiple occasions, M8 alarms, Khamisiyah bunker filled with sarin gas. I too, believe we deserve a Purple Heart. Your CIB should be easy to prove with your DD-214 showing your time in Desert Storm and your MOS. Send a copy to HRC to get it fixed. Oh yeah, file for Aid and Attendance instead of the caregiver program.\nGood Luck.\nDear Honorable Secretary of VA Mr Collin’s , I was so happy to hear that you are now the New Secretary of the Va. Cherry Point Base had referred me to the VA in New Bern, NC. after seeing 5 Jag Attorneys at Cherry Point Base with President Trump placing my case Under Major Domestic Violence April 2018. Congressman Murphy office in Greenville stated they would be glad to help when I had a claim . Sir I do have a claim that Honorable Senator Dole, Craven county DSS had assisted with in 2008 with Winston Salem VA. I understand that you are a chaplain. Sir this situation is not God, it’s evil. Thirty years of the quality of my life and family is completely destroyed. The course of our lives have been changed unnaturally. Since President Trump had taken office I have had to notify the President. The only assurance that I have received is from Craven Community College, very little assistance from DSS , and one of the families from the college assisting with one of their familiy members temporarily, with staying with a elderly. I have also contacted Randy Forbes law office in Washington DC Greenberg Traugrig as they taken my consideration rights, civil rights, liberty rights, fundamental rights, with them not honoring the rule of law. I would definitely appreciate any assistance that would be given as they have me trapped financially. Thank you\nWe have no proof whatsoever that an unvetted non-federal employee working under the fake federal entity DOGE that was not even Congressionally created (as lawfully required)…has not illegally accessed our super sensitive military Veteran medical records, disability records and personal information contacting our SSN #s, birth dates, address, phone numbers, etc. I do not believe anyone hired by the current president, a convicted felon.\nAwesome! Thanks for posting . My feelings exactly! Where is the accountability?\nhave you ever been to the DMV????\nPlease – you are assuming that any other federal employee is honest and good. What we do know if our country is in deep financial trouble and DOGE has the smartest people on it to comb through waste, fraud and abuse to save our taxpayer money. So quit whining and realize how licky we are to have these 2 great men working feverishly to save America. They are plenty rich enough – they do not have to do it but they must for our kids. By the way, 58% of Americans approve of Trump and Elon’s DOGE. DOGE employees are employed by the federal government as hired by Trump/Elon.\nThis…right here. Absolutely.\nWe need to have our Vr@e. Benefits expedited.\nVeterans have to wait for 5-7 months for any sort of vocational rehabilitation. The offices of Greenville SC are completely closed and when I went in person to the physical office, there is a schedule sign and a government vehicle. The department of the Veterans affairs educational benefits needs and our health care benefits are slow and veterans are dying waiting for the proper care!\nPlease work with Doug Collins together so we can fix Greenville SC. CBOC and build another hospital for veteran in the Upstate south Carolina!!\nChatGPT said:\nCertainly! Here’s a revised version of your message with a clear and professional tone:\nSubject: Urgent Request for Expedited VR&E Benefits and Improved Veteran Services in Greenville, SC\nDear [Recipient’s Name],\nI am writing to bring urgent attention to the current state of Veterans’ services in Greenville, SC. Veterans in our community are facing excessive delays in accessing Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) benefits, with wait times of 5-7 months. This situation is unacceptable, as it severely impacts veterans’ ability to transition to civilian life and gain meaningful employment.\nIn addition, the Greenville SC offices of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are completely closed, leaving many veterans without support. During a recent visit to the physical office, I noticed a schedule sign and a government vehicle, but no available staff to assist. This lack of accessibility is only furthering the frustration of our local veterans.\nOur veterans are also facing delays in receiving educational and healthcare benefits, leading to serious concerns about their well-being. Tragically, some veterans are dying while waiting for the care they rightfully deserve. This is a situation that cannot be allowed to continue.\nI urge you to collaborate with Congressman Doug Collins to address these issues and expedite the process for VR&E benefits. Additionally, I implore you to work towards establishing a new VA hospital in the Upstate of South Carolina to better serve the needs of our veteran population, particularly those in Greenville.\nThe time to act is now, and I trust you will prioritize the health and well-being of those who have served our country. Our veterans deserve better.\nThank you for your attention to this critical matter. I look forward to your prompt response and action.\nYou Have 2 Senators And A Rep. Collectively they Will Be More Than Happy To Expedite All Concerns. Lindsey Graham/Tim Scott/Nancy Mace. They Are Dedicated In Helping Veterans Of All Military Campaigns. The Above Individuals Are Dedicated to Transparency. Good Luck!\ni think it wonderful that the military has decided to consider to right some of the wrong judgments unfair decisions handed down,most vetrans didnt join the military to fail or qut to get thrown out, , we sighn up in all honesty to succeed , for life careers , to lead productive lives , some unfortunate veterans may have fell short in some of there endeavors and encounters during there service , or for various other reasons , weather you couldnt get along with your higher ups, because of biases ,racism , mentel illnesses ignored ,harrassment/ mst ,ptsd, fraternizing , seen and judged by one person veterans not being given the chance to redeem or get medical help in some instances counseling, instead of just being thrown out most veterans dont want to leave fail go home failures ,the process were flawed mental health wasnt recognized., ptsd wasnt recognized untill 1980 , many veterans suffered mentaly it was ignored or went unnoticed there were no proccessin place ,this is not a hand out,, it is a hand up, to our fallen misfortunate stigmatize hidden wounded soliders ,there were discrepancies ,prejudices inconsistencies in the discharge process, so i think it was over do. good luck to those veterans who suffered for years carrying this hidden wound, being look down on frown upon, rejected, not able to get jobs, ,because of differences between two people from different backgrounds cultures etc , because of mentel conditions at the time of said events or a behavior sustained from trama ptsd mst ,harrassment, fraternization,\nAs a wife of a Veteran and I feel to just vent my feelings here. I wished that if my husband’s PSA level was thoroughly examined and monitored closely like yearly mandatory check up for males I believe that He would not start His Chemotherapy tomorrow, 2/18/25.\nIt was 7-1/2 years laps His VA doctor didn’t check his prostate until His PSA level became very high and cancer cells was present that ended him getting Prostatectomy surgery. My husband had several infusions, injections and oral meds but the cancer had metastasized to his bones. Now Chemotherapy is needed to hopefully stop the spread to his organs. I hope that this comment helps improve the dignity of patient care in our Virginia Veterans. I believed that negligence of care is present in my husband’s care. I’m very sad to see Him undergo many treatments.\nI thank You for allowing me to share. God Bless.\nFile a TORT CLAIM against the VA for negligence. It is not hard to do. Gather your evidence and submit your form.\nGood Luck\nI’m very sorry to read of your plight. For any veteran men here, just do what I did – doesnt cost a ton of money – go to Quest labs and pay for your own “PSA blood test” and if the result is oitnof range get that to your doctor and that will start the action going for diagnosis. Too many wait around or trust in the gloved finger test. Just pay for your own psa blood test. I did and thank God we caught my husband’s PSA was very high. That triggered a prostate biopsy which was a gleason score showing aggressive type, so then a staging nuclear medicine bine scan and visit to surgeon at City of Hope for robotic removal. And get this – the doctor at that initial medical annual physical was not going to give him anything because he looked so good and healthy and strong. But I was the one who pushed to write to get the blood test (more accurate than digital rectum exam). My hunch was because he was not having good solid urine streams – yes I heard a change in his urine stream “habits”.\nMay God bless your husband and you. I wish him the best. I too got Prostate cancer, possibly from Agent Orange exposure but who knows. I’m lucky it was caught early, treated with radiation/hormone therapy and is in remission. Even though I have a primary care doctor at my local VA Clinic, my civilian Urologist called out the cancer diagnosis early with my sudden high PSA level. Take care brother.\nI’m sad to say I really no longer trust the VA Administrations. No issues with the doctors, nurse at the facilities but the senior leadership.\nOnce again the senior leadership within the VA will need to earn my trust. Zero trust in DOGE\nDOGE found hundreds ( if not more by now) of upper level case managers working from home, using personal computers ( not DOD secure) to access VA account information and sensitive information… Along with the lack of security measures by these admins they were only working a few hours a week while still taking a full salary….\nCriminals running VAMC Caregiver authorization . If you’re dying, you’re not a problem for long and if you’re dead, you’re not a. Problem..\nDOGE it out of Existance. Criminals that never approve a single Veteran for caregiver help. Absolutely anti-american, against Veterans that need caregivers that are blind, and have all the problems with activities of daily living..\nCall me\n1SG Combat Vet, Caregiver\nThe VAMC Caregiver program is criminal lengthy weights, obscenely long interviews just to say no.\nThey need the doge now and eradicate its staff completely. I help take care of Veterans. It is a salmon and swim upstream and you know what happens..\nThe rule is if you’re dying, you’re not a problem for long and if you’re dead, you’re not a problem\nVA should loan on tiny Homes for Veterans on wheels. There are too many veterans that are homeless, and never could afford a five or $600,000 mortgage, but they may be able to afford $125,000 government sponsored Tiny home on wheels with their service connection.\nI was rated at 100% disabled (service connected) back in 2012 before I was discharged from the military. I had a major depressive episode due to bipolar disorder and TBI with mood disorder. Not to mention that my career was done due to my 2 lower back surgeries and 1 cervical surgery that led to a prosthetic disc and fusion in my neck. Dealing with the constant pain and the plethora of consistent changing medications, I had a suicide attempt that led to me smoking some pot. The Army violated Army Regulations and Command Policy as well as some other nefarious acts that led to me being taken to a special court martial to adjudicate a BCD as well as threatening me with 4 years in a military prison. Having a wife and two children, a home that we had bought, and watch many other soldiers get wrongfully disciplined by command and getting unfavorable discharges, I opted to take a chapter 10 in lieu of the court-martial. I found out later on after having the chance to actually look at my records, I found many mistakes and other discrepancies in my discharge that I can say with the utmost conviction, my discharge was wrongful. My DD214 is so messed up it will take forever just to fix that one document alone. After my exiting service with two terms of service, the first term of 3 years 4 and a half months under honorable conditions and a second term that was 3 years 2 months of service cut short and getting a characterization of OTH, I went to the VA 3 days after my discharge. I wanted to find out if I had any entitlement to benefits at all. I was told by the VA that I was entitled to no benefits at all. Not even unemployment. I went back to the VA in 2015 in another state, which was my home of record and found out that I could get medical benefits for any injuries or conditions being treated for while in service. In 2018 I entered the DOM to stop drinking and tried to apply for my GIBill. The college I was wanting to attend told me that I didn’t have any GIBill benefits because of my OTH discharge. In 2021 I found out that I did have my GIBill benefits through another education institution. However the VA wants to short me 10% of my GIBill benefit. I did a patient inquiry into my VA records in 2022 and could not believe what I found. The VA has me showing that I have no service connected disabilities and that I have had no surgeries what so ever. I started going through my medical records from my disability claim while in the service and am appalled by what I am finding. The incorrect information, the false statements by physicians, the refusal to use my tri-care paid off post mental health providers diagnosis that the VA at the time was treating me for, the policy violations from Army Regulations and Command Policy on soldiers that are in the MEB/PEB process and the VA IDES process, finding out that MEB/PEB and VA disability determinations were purposefully withheld from the General Court Martial Convening Authority when the disability processes were completed and before my court martial was even read to me. These disability finding are supposed to be taken into consideration when a soldier is taken to a court-martial not to mention that I had a daughter that was enrolled in the exceptional family member program for autism. The program I was in was a Joint DoD and VA program while going through the evaluation process. I have contacted the VA and DoD and they both wanna play “pass the buck” and not take responsibility for the indiscretions they have both committed. Let’s also add that during the time of my evaluations the Unit I was assigned to “a pilot program” was being investigated for multiple issues. I have ran into more issues for trying to do the right thing and point out these issues through my own personal experience as well as documentation that proves what indiscretions had been done against these soldiers. I have solid evidence of it and I can’t get a soul to look at it. I have been played so many times by my health care providers when they tell me to bring in any documents that I want put into my health records. I bring them in and no one looks at them. They had me believing that they didn’t have any record of my medical history from the Army. Then I find out that they can pull them up at any time. Why would they stress me out like that? I called the main VA in DC to get transfered 4 times, the person I spoke with told me they have no record of my claim filed back in 2011 or my ratings in 2012. I find that odd when I have all of my records to include the original claim filed in 2011 that is date stamped received by the VA in Winston – Salem plus the entire packet filed with the MEB/PEB and VA DES including my NARSUM, QTC exam reports, and MEB/PEB and VA Findings and Ratings, a signed DA199 that shows my paperwork was withheld by the signature date alone. Can we say, “denied due process” and “railroading”?\nDaniel are you living my life. I was Deserted by my command in March 1991 as other unit members witnessed this. Then it all got turned on me and mysteriously all the unit records vanish. Then comes the ol Chapter 10 OTH I would have been better off at Court Martial. I was straight out denied records by the DOD until I got my Congress rep involved in 2006, but they even have him the ol bait n switch move cause the records he got were nothing more than fire starter. Imagine my surprise in 2023 when yet again I request my Congress rep to get records and I think somebody made a boo boo for the first time in 33 years I learned the name of my accuser. Your not alone brother Chapter 10 OTH is no where remotely close to the bulls eye of Justice and that practice needs to cease immediately. any one that is facing these issues we are stronger together than apart hit my email so we can ban together and demand answers and change in this new Golden Age!\nAre more judges going to be appointed for the Camp Lejeune Claims and lawsuits which are at 450,000 and it has been two half years?\nThe 35 year time frame is it a law ?

Any help answerijg this question would be greatly appreciated\nSir\nNobody notified to me to get tested ever after Desert Storm and now all these years later I find out I am sick from it. My driver has been 100% disabled for YEARS but now I am filing and have to fight tooth and nail for my family. I don’t have a positive outlook so I am filing more for\ntheir future. I have been sick for years and you need to do better notifying us before it’s to late like now. My health is in shambles and now I have to battle on my claim!!! I can’t believe this really was done to vets who would do it again for their country.\nCollins, you’re a liar like the rest of them. We don’t trust you. And all the overreach of DOGE that you’re allowing to happen? You’re a freaking disgrace. You must really think we’re stupid. You record a video with your cheery southern twang thinking you will win us over? You won’t. We aren’t sheep.\nOnce you were sick you should’ve started seeking treatment and follow up care. You waited until the PACT ACT was available for the bells to go off in your head. Like most GW Veterans we were sick almost immediately upon return. We noticed the changes and sought care only for Dr’s to tell us we were crazy and it was in our heads. It’s not too late for you as every condition is presumptive by providing your DD-214 showing your service in theater. It’s helpful to have those diagnoses’ but not required. Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue, IBS are all presumptive.\nSo why are you cutting doctors and nurse who are on probation? It is hard enough to get this group to apply for jobs in the VA. I am very concerned about the state of the VA for our veterans. I am a retired VA nurse who loved caring for Veterans. My late husband USMC/VN died in 2004 due to Agent Orange exposure: non Hoskins lymphoma. It seems that the current administration in DC is not listening to the “boots on the ground “ employees, those nurses and doctors and health techs who care daily for our veterans. The VA is not a business: it involves real people : who put their lives on the line for our country.\nI hope veterans will wake up to see how the VA has been privatized for decades. —with decreasing benefits. And that Congress for the 7th year will NOT cosponsor and pass a Dental bill (HR 210) for all veterans in the VA healthcare system. I am told “too expensive”. Check out who has signed onto this bill.\nDealing with a doctor that lost job because of the morphine he was writing, he left me no choice but to quit myself. I ordered CBD off Amazon & failed urinalysis from taking supplements. That was 2013 roughly? VA will not pay for pain medication because I’ve since got my Medical Cannabis Card & get in prescription. The VA hasn’t paid for my medication since I quit the morphine the doctor prescribed (180mg 4times a day) . If I hadn’t thrown away I would not be here. Was up to 370lbs. Please look into why Veterans get punished for pain medication because of the THC? The first thing I did joining the Navy was I had to get a waiver for using in high school for the government. My mother said always be honest & here’s a good reason why? I like a pain patch but it costs 90$ a month. Paying for my own medication has hurt me, also recovering from Storm. Being punished for CBD is outdated & another reason for the VA to say no? Would like to help other Vets as well. Very Respectfully Sir thank you\nPlease check on why the higher V.A higher up Admin used the Pact Act funds for a raise 10.9 million? Marsha Blackburn V.A.Admin website. Why are there only four judges overseeing the Pact Act claims lawsuit 450,000? Who made the ruling 35 year time frame when it was 1953-1980.Thank you so much for your time\nMusk would love to know about the 10.9 million..\nHow can we trust anyone appointed by Trump and his co-president Musk. There is no truth anymore. I doubt any of our data is safe.\nMany veterans who have injuries caused by their military service should be taken care of. From slipped discs to the most severe in which they lost limbs. Its the honorable thing to do. I don’t understand how non-veterans who dont risk their lives can even ask to take away any benefits from veterans. The way I see it…send those kinds of people into combat or have them unload heavy equipment all day year round which eventually breaks down their body. Once they have their injuries..I bet they dont want to be abandoned. Its not even just physical pain… as the years go by… veterans get so freaking angry their pain is non-stop and they can’t do what others can do. Get jealous of injury free people older then them jumping around. Can’t even stand without freaking muscle spasms/cramps or annoying headaches. And it gets worse as you get older. Filled with nothing but regret.\nSecretary Collins, first and foremost, congratulations on your appointment. I was hoping to send you an email, but that seems impossible. Not sure if this will reach you, but hopefully it is relay to the leadership team associated with the VA facility. I am a retired veteran, USMC. Looking through these posts, there definitely is some bellyaching, I am sure some is warranted. I just want you to know on how employees at the White River Junction VA in VT, go above and beyond. I had an appointment on Wednesday at occupational therapy, I also was scheduled the following day to get my hearing aids. There was a pretty good snowstorm rolling in the following day, and I knew if it was going to get as bad as predicted, I would not make my appointment. I took a chance and went to audiology and explained my concerns, the staff up front were professional and got an IM to my audiologist. She cut her lunch break short and saw me. Hearing aids issued. Accolades to the professionals at White River Junction VA in Vermont.\nPlease check on why the higher V.A higher up Admin used the Pact Act funds for a raise 10.9 million?

And her job will be eliminated by 2027.?\nGut VHA and give us insurance, community care is trash and the approval process is a nightmare for veterans and the providers who get paid $.27 on the dollar for services. As a provider I wouldn’t want to deal with that crap for a fraction of the pay. Just saying. ?♂️\nDear Mr. Collins,\nMy husband, Clifford Oliver Mealy, is undergoing treatment for service related bladder cancer. He served in the Navy during Vietnam. And applied for his benefits in 2023 after he was diagnosed.\nHe has not been able to work. His business as a photographer has faltered because he is unable to work.\nHe was told that his benefits would come in a year. Now it’s two years and he has yet to receive his promised benefits.\nThen, he received a letter that his benefits have been “deferred.”\nWe cannot get anyone in the VA to tells us what this means.\nNeedless to say, this is very upsetting as his diagnosis has destroyed his business. And we have no idea when this will be resolved.\nThis needs to stop we need all employees who work at VA with these cuts now we are going to wait longer for all dr. appointment, compensation reviews VA was already short hand now it’s even more if you want to make cuts look at the contract that the goverment has with vendors, look at Elon Musk and how many contract he has with the goverment and how much he made off the goverment.\nMental health “professionals” are just treating Veterans with legitimate issues with very little concern. They rush Veterans through these unhelpful programs rather than addressing the actual problems to fill their books. I would like to see a change where they take quality over quantity.\nTaking anything away from veterans is shameful especially when the military budget is so large. Cut that in half and give it to the veterans! We are being told that people working on the veterans crises line were laid off! You are lying to us Collins! During Trump’s last presidency he was found to have lied more than 35,000 times! Each lie has been documented. Stop believing what he says! There are people working the crises lines at the VA and they are saying that they were fired. I think I will believe them before I believe you or Trump. You don’ care about the veterans. Neither does Trump. I wonder how much he is paying you to misrepresent the truth.\n“The Trump administration is right now firing researchers at VA who do lifesaving work for our veterans—research to prevent veteran suicide, build lifechanging prosthetics, address opioid addiction, and more.\nLoved this! Straight forward right on target!\n… and have enough respect for the dignity of the office to put on a blazer!\nJane, get a life!!!\nPlease focus on Fraud Waste and Abuse. I guarantee there is tons of money spent on veterans who have passed away who are still being sent disability compensation.\nI’m a huge supporter of Pres. Trump, and I’ve been generally pleased with his agency/dept picks. However, in response to a veteran friend’s concerns about “cuts to veterans’ services and benefits,” I pulled up Sec. Collins’ video above, and I was wholly unimpressed and underwhelmed by the Secretary’s drive-by remarks and his folksy, gee whiz attitude. It struck me as arrogant (“I’m so smart I don’t need preparation”) and lazy, too lazy not to have developed SPECIFIC AND SUBSTANTIVE rebuttals to the left’s SPECIFIC allegations.\nMore directly: Mr. Secretary, Pres. Trump has given you this incredible honor and entrusted you with this grave responsibility to lead this august Department in serving our treasured veterans, women and men to whom we owe the highest debt to provide them and their families/caregivers the very highest quality healthcare and service. Lack of preparation and lack of seriousness is disrespectful and is not going to cut it! It might be fine to “wing it” or “phone it in” as a commentator on a news show, but it’s not appropriate for this position! Going forward, if you don’t actually KNOW the specific allegations leveled against the Department, then be smart enough to have your deputies brief you first. Then PREPARE your remarks WITH SPECIFICITY, before you go on camera. Your response was not only vapid, it was embarrassing. I was therefore forced to go elsewhere to address my veteran friend’s very real concerns, to which she was entitled to receive a responsive, quality, SUBSTANTIVE answer. Until your staff can bring you up to speed, here’s a simple response you could have given (though we should be able to expect far more from you, since you head the Department – you should be the resident EXPERT on all things V.A.!):\nhttps://youtu.be/1K9X4lHIFgE?si=z1Q-yC-7ctgUCaJx\nPlease relay all of my remarks to the Secretary.\n“At VA, we are focused on saving money so it can be better spent on Veteran care. We thank these employees for their service to VA. This was a tough decision, but ultimately it’s the right call to better support the Veterans, families, caregivers, and survivors the department exists to serve,” Doug Collins.\nAn Oxymoron statement to say the least…you’re a used car salesman (no offense meant to used car salesman) you will say anything to accomplish your ultimate objective just like your Commander and Chief ( Project 2025 ) Zero hope for a fair and impartial government and VA. And by the way cutting Veterans from their jobs is truly heartless. Dick move Doug! Why not start with the 10 million in bonuses for the upper echelon in the VA. I wonder!\nThe buck stops at Trump, he chose this guy. He should be held accountable for his poor choice. He also chose the OMB head, who is the real threat to Veteran’s benefits.\nI have one word. BULLSH-T\ngulf war veterans need a reform act in 2025/2026.\nis there feed back ?\nWe are in need of help from the top\nThere is a “Scam” on the disability claims on the veterans. I have been fighting it for over a year and a half with minimal outcome. My local VA veteran advocate is a Star, but the data input center in Janesville Wisconson is a constant “let down”. The failure is the VA hand-off to private 3rd parties for the “confirmation appointments.\nI’d be glad to share the details with a real Military Veteran in Secretary Collins office if someone can contact me …\nCollins is full of it and services will fall significantly. Our government leaders are liars, who maintain control by continual misrepresentation. Too bad the many believe others because of their own inability to control themselves. Do not expect anything from our government because it has become self evident that those leaders can only enrich themselves by screwing those they supposedly represent\nLies lies lies. People have never waited longer for their benefits to be approved, you won’t give them the services they need or medications, and make disabled people drive for hours to see a doctor that can’t do their job because of your policies. You should be ashamed to stand there and lie like that you monster\nSounds like someone with a Bad Chicken Dinner, eh?\nDishonorable discharges get nothing from American taxpayers.\nTrump administration begins mass firings across government\nFri, February 14, 2025 at 9:28 PM CST\n“more than 1,000 at the Department of Veterans Affairs,”\nHow does firing 1,000’s of people at the VA help improve services to us?\nConcerned with taxing VA disability that was proposed in Dec 2024 – this would greatly impact many disabled vets and their families. Spouses who get CHAMPVA due to their vet spouse having P&T 100% disability should be able to use the VA facilities. Meds by Mail under CHAMPVA take close to 3 weeks to fill prescriptions.\nDear Honorable Secretary of VA Mr Collins, Thank you for your service. I personally have had a hard time receiving assistance after going through major domestic violence with one of your Marines. Honorable President Trump with his administration April 2018 placed my case under Major Domestic Violence. Cherry Point Base referred me to the VA in New Bern a few years ago. Congressman Murphy office stated they would be glad to help when I have a VA claim. I do Sir that Honorable Senator Elizabeth Dole and the Department of Social Services assisted me with in 2008. They have a copy of my claim, yet nothing. I have lost my dad as a United States World War Two veteran, my mom, two Aunts and I was told I would never see my brother a live. They took many years of special occasions and holidays away from me. They changed the course of my life and family unnaturally. One of the biggest problems is they have my domestic violence money and compounding it and spending it their project with making thousands off myself and family every day. They continue to give my husband federal money and benefits after the Trump administration placed my case under major domestic violence. NC is a 50/50 state with out domestic violence issues. Major discrimination. I have been in and out of homelessness while owning property which there was a mistake on. They have taken away my constitutional rights, liberty rights, civil rights, fundamental rights and denied me attorney. I have contacted Randy Forbes with Green Traurig in Washington DC with notifying President Trump, With the United States Supreme Court as they continue to take my life and family for money. The only assistance that I have been receiving is from Craven Community College, while attending, DSS, and a family from the college to assist in care giving to one of their families. I have been staying with a elder for the last few months. Sir I have requested mercy and grace from President Trump as this has cost a total of 30 years of the quality of my life and family. A few years ago I had spoken to Diane from Winston Salem VA as they do know that this was major domestic violence with one of their marines. Honorable Secretary of VA Mr Collin I am requesting mercy and grace from the VA to have closure on my case. Thank you.\nI deal with the VA in Hampton I get my medication‘s by Mail from Hampton my doctor is in Hampton Dr. Chip route and I don’t have no issues with the VA I get 100% disability from the VA for ancient Orange Vietnam and now I got chronic bronchitis That I filed another claim for but when I get my medication I got all this paperwork with the medication‘s which I don’t think they need I always throw it in the garbage I think they should go paperless when they’re sending your medication’s to you just about every veteran knows what their Vedic medications are for I think they should cut back on the paperwork that goes in the mail that ends up in the garbage it’s costing the money to print it cost the money to buy the paper for packaging all the paperwork is in the package when you get it with your pills good luck to all veterans and the va .vetnam vet\nAbsolutely true! The reams of paper sent to me (with my name and address on every page) is completely unnecessary. Maybe only when the medication is first prescribed and perhaps once a year at renewal would suffice? As it is now, the bill for paper alone in the Pharmacy must be a big hit on the overall budget.\nYa’ll believe this if you want. Musk is running it all and is making millions a day on government contracts. They don’t care about vets or anyone that’s not elite. It’s all part of Project 2025 and put it out there. Ya’ll done F around And Found Out. People want to blame Trump, but he’s so far deep in, clueless and he’s lost control and only doing what’s he being told.\nThankyou for taking care of the Veterans.I am Vietnam Veteran.I was over there from earley 1968 to 1970.I had two tours with the 39th cav.The VA has been very good to me and still are.Thankyou very much for all the help they have given me.\nI don’t believe a word from you or the Traitor and his clowns.\nSo…you were pleased with the dementia patient in the Oval Office the past 4 years?\nDonald J.

I’m currently rated at 70% for PTSD, 50% for my feet, 30% for my lung (gulf war veteran), 10% for hearing, and 10% for my back that I have had 3 surgeries on and will need another one within the year. This is crazy!!! I’m rated at 90% rather then 100% and only 10% for my back!!! I can barely walked and stand not able to work anymore but I’m 90% that has taken since 2011 to get this rating!!! We need to fix this!!! ASAP\nFile for your presumptive condition. Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue and IBS.

I have several friends that are Veteran Service Officer’s have been FIRED.\nMr. Collins,\nCan you please get rid of the mandate to take the COVID-19 (so called vaccine) and the flu shots as a VA healthcare worker. My family was mandated to take it and now have permanent side effects. This should be a personal decision not mandated by employers, or government agencies.\nNoone is required to take C19 anymore.\nYou are being a lying drama queen. It was never mandated in the first place.\nGood to see a real leader that has been where many of us have been,\nthanks for taking the rein’s Sir\nClearing cases quicker? I had a claim in since 6/2024 to add a dependent and it has been in step 1 of the process for 8 months. I checked the status today and the VA website says I now have no claims. I called the VA and they told me the VA closed the claim. No action taken! The VA rep had no clue as to why they would close it. This is adding a dependent back on. This should not be a difficult request and it certainly shouldn’t take 8 months then have your claim closed with no action taken.\nSame here since July 25, 2024. The claim is stuck in the “claim received “ stage. I’ve emailed AskVA several times and keep getting the same response about they identified a problem in their program and they are working on it as quickly as possible, blah, blah, blah.\nThe VA claims process is a joke at best! As far as firings go, I only have issues with the half illiterate DEI employees behind the office counters. They need to go and be replaced with competent employees who stay off of their personal phones and stop their personal conversations when someone is trying to check in/out, ask a question, etc. There was an incident at the VAMC that I go to where they were behind the sliding glass having story time. A Vet walked up, the girl at the counter turned around, saw him standing there, and then turned back around and continued story time. The Vet slid the glass window open and the girl went off on him in front of everyone. It did not end well for either. She got snatched through the window opening and he was detained by the VA rent-a-cops. I don’t know how much trouble he got into, but hopefully she learned that some Vets are easily triggered and you don’t talk to us like we’re off the streets.\nI’m just happy I can put names to faces.\nWe need a roundtable discussion about national issues related to our service connected disability’s. The VA staff and Doctors are not listening and we need a special exemption for presumption rules that are lacking from the Gulf War 1990/1991 War Zone. We should be treated the same way the OiF /OEF are getting. 1991 War Veterans are not getting the treatments they deserve. We need National Attention on this matter. The law needs to change post 1990 Veterans.\nAs the parent of a veteran who was wounded in battle, not given medical attention and then operated on because he had a growth coming out of the side of his head where he had been impacted and they “couldn’t send him back with that” and then had to wait until 2017 to receive full benefits, I don’t understand. I have within the last 8 months applied for his medical records again from NARA. They referred me to the Army and the Army has not responded to my request to have my son put on a Casualty list and be given the Purple Heart which he bled for. Please let me know who I can contact to get this processed and also get a car which a paraplegic can drive (applied on 3/2024). Also have the home modified, and his benefits listed as 100% service-connected instead of 90% 10% unemployability. This happened in 1/1991. Please help to resolve.\nContact Wounded Warrior Project.\nGood morning Doctor Bonafoux Rivera, I want to express my gratitude and respect for your courage and commitment to help your son. This forum here will not be able to resolve this issue. You may need to contact your local VBA or VHA and work with a patient advocate or a veteran organization like the legion or DVA. If you must you can also reach out to the congressman or senators from your state as they may be able to put assistance on this issue. I wish your son and the family health and strength, please stay focused and do not give up. The nation and all other veterans are with you.\nRespectfully,\naguilar santos\nMr. Secretary, Pres.Trump & etc..Its hard to believe the the VA in not recognizing BURN PITS in Vietnam.\nThey were used eveyday in all base camps. Stiring everything they could burn in these pits, by our hands\nusing wooden poles and no mask or breathing , no eye protection, no hearing protection, no protective clothing you name it.\nAll done by the lowest ranking personnel.\nSo the VN vets file claims for Asthma, skin cancers and etc… all denied !\nSo what else can they do to us?\nThis is where the military got its ideas to use them again in the Middle East.\nBut they recognize this damage to the soliders there, not Nam.\nSo please fix it! Correct the failures of last aministrations who have failed us.\nSecretary Collins and Presdient Trump administration\nThank you\nThe DOD has long maintained that there never was any Agent Orange on Okinawa. This is a lie. It was used to clear foliage along the Kadena AFB perimeter fence. In 1971 the DOD (under pressure from the Japanese Government) conducted “Operation Red Hat” where all poisonous gases and defoliants were transferred to Johnston Atoll aboard naval ships. Those sailors involved are eligible for Agent Orange treatment and compensation. Those Okinawan Marines who loaded these chemicals onto deuce and halvess and delivered them to the dock are not! I developed high level and profuse prostate cancer (classic result of Agent Orange exposure). It had to be removed. The VA wouldn’t cover it because “there was never any Agent Orange on Okinawa. I can deliver proof that there was. In fact, years later there were many barrels of AO found buried at Camp Foster where l was assugned.\nUnder Biden the pact act was passed to help veterans that was impacted from burn pits get your story right\nNot Vietnam burn pits sparky\nThe VA claims that the benefits are improving and the care is improving. When I needed a x-ray on my neck it took 3 months to get a order and by then I already had a ct scan at the hospital which the care wasn’t any better. I ended up going to Vanderbilt emergency surgery to remove a tumor off my spine. VA or any civilian care around where I live is hopeless.\nWhen you deal with bad PLs that do not change, it takes a good staff around the Sec of VA to show executive options. Not rely on Congress to do all the work. The Sec literally has similar powers as a President. So CFR 38 ss 3.317 does not service connect because of the UDX aspect they could fix that. Gulf war is tied to closely to Undiagnosed Illness, VA countered this by making everything diagnosed even if its wrong.\nSo it fails at 93% rejection rate which VA loves. All wars should be service connected by time, date, and location. Which they have begun to do with OIF / OEF under the PACT act. Only to find the PACT act exclusionary to 1991 Gulf War vets. it sometimes can literally be the title of the section of CFR 38 that hinders a rating and the ICD codes. Something I tried to fix on a VA federal advisory committee that VA blew off. I did the l same with the PACT act in 2021 when I said in the news media it had loopholes, and by September came the flood of zero ratings. The best most can do is 30% between gulf war and OIF, OEF – zero rating is often the end result. Its not fair.\n————————————————————-\nThere isnt enough room and they only allow 5,000 words here. So you will find the bulk of my remarks on the VA Facebook post of this article. Im a 28 year advocate, Disabled combat veteran, and served of a VA federal advisory committee – ACGWV in 2009. In 2003 I was world famous for opposing the deployment of troops to Iraq. Last 3 years Ive pummeled this public comments portion of New.va.gov over VA RAC meetings, and found VA ignores these public comment portions.\nIm a subject matter expert with a lot to offer. Im also a historian having participated in our plight since 1997. So Ive learned one thing about VA, unless your part of the wealthy in the executive branch – then they dont care. Ive looked out the Sec of VAs window long ago, and this is my 14th Sec of VA to deal with. As long as Im a poor disabled veteran, Im not worthy of there time. It didnt use to be this way.\nClearing cases faster? Over a year ago, l filed a 511 claim. It took a year to clear when the average clearance time was 14 months. My claim was rejected due to “not service connected”! 511 claims are for injuries sustained in VA hospitals. There is never a service connection in 511 claims!\nI’m fighting an 1151 claim going on 10 years. They are always denied. Then you go into the never ending appeals process. Get help from DAV or another VSO or organization. And keep an eye on them because some of them aren’t competent either.\nVA’s answer to my questions is to block my cell phone internet access to va.gov\nwhich says volumes. Sec of VA Doug Collins signed off on that for it to happen.\nHe has no intentions of helping anyone in my income bracket.\nPretty sure we have another coward Sec of VA that doesnt face veterans unless\nhe benefits from it some how. As Ive only written 4 emails and asked simple\nquestions. I think the biggest reason they are dodging me is I found there maybe\na 1 in 5 rate of ALS in those that served the last 34 years. At minimum 1 in 10.\nWell, Ive got my answer then. Snob Sec of VA. Religious zealot with a superiority\ncomplex. He is one of the chosen, and I am not. Seen enough of these. Its gods will\nmy life has been like this, and some of us are just unlucky. He only has time for\nhis fellow followers, believers, and the rest of us are wrong.\nGoing to be a very bad year for us veterans. Till folks catch on.\nI have been assigned a new VA clinic that recently opened. I have a new Doctor. How is the order to fire all new federal employees going to affect my new clinic and my Doctor? I have been exposed to Agent Orange and currently have a mass in my lung and also in my throat. I am scheduled for surgery in May, is that still going to happen? I put in a claim for my agent orange exposure, is that still going to be processed? When you say your clearing cases faster than ever, is that because your just saying NO quickly? What percentage of claims are you denying? The scuttlebutt is that all new claims will be denied. This stuff is giving me a lot of anxiety.\nThank you Mr. Collins. Not to shabby for your first week!\nAs a Government employee for 40 years (NAVY-VA combined), I see there is nothing easy or quick about applying for benefits. I have given up on reopening claims. I can relate to some of these comments.\nKeep the faith!\nMadam Collins,\nThank you for denying these allegations and simply telling us lies. The truth would be unbearable and make the administration look bad. Please refrain from telling the truth if it makes you look bad. Continue to lie to us and we will believe you as long as your lies are what we want to hear.\nMadam Collins? What are you, 10 yrs old. Grow up and act like a Veteran who served Honorably, but my guess is that you probably didn’t.\nHe’s probably from ME and has been writing to Susan Collins. Cut and paste. Your reply indicates more about your own values than his. You should be ashamed not him or her.\nYou know darn well he meant Secretary of VA Collins. You should be ashamed that your momma gave birth to you.\nHello Mr. Collins. If you want to see what is really going on in the VA that are supposed to be knowledgeable veteran raters, please sir contact me and I will give you the details to look at my case. I have called my congressman, called my senator, call the complaint line twice and my claim is a hardship claim, Going on eleven months and been to 16 C&P exams. I have done everything that I can think of. I know this comment won’t reach your eyes but you have staff that hates veterans. The more they can give you the run around and not rate your claim, the better the must feel about themselves. The VA is violating their own regulations and I will be happy to provide rules they set about medical evidence and exams. Everytime I complain too loud, they has VES set me up more appointments. Then they lie to you when you can see your file and have screen shots to prove they are not being honest. USMC 3/1972 – 11/1974\nDOGE has absolutely NO authority to access veteran’s personal information. It is NOT a legitimate organization and therefore needs to be blocked.\nI personally trust a multi Billionaire, more than the past dozen supposed leaders, we all need to face it our info is already out there , as many time as we have had medical record swappers, the streamlining of our services, out info has been jeopardized decades ago, let them find and let us all know what our tax dollars have been blown away on, when we had people in charge who didn’t even know which gender they are you were seriously comprised,\nHave faith in the powers that now be.\nI have to admit, there is a lot of truth to what this person is saying. The mega men and women in Congress and the Senate have violated their oath to the constitution. They have turned their backs on democracy and have supported a traitor, a felon and a hollow man, and just like him they have no moral compass, no values and no character.\nHistory will be especially hard on these people, and any veteran who has his sense of self will be willing to go through the last full measure to ensure that these people never rise to the top.\nspoken like am intelligent person. Good on you. too many here speak without knowing truth.\nWhy on earth would you trust a billionaire that fired the people who were investigating his companies within the first month of being placed in a position? Musk is literally only here for the money that he will earn. He does not care for us nor for any Democracy, hence why he was supporting the far-right parties of European countries.\nWhy would you trust a billionaire who is firing thousands of people so he can save more money on his taxes? Why would you trust a man who is destroying NASA so he can get his personal company more contracts from the government? Think about it for a moment, please. You don’t become a multi-billionaire without deciding money is the most important thing in your entire life, and he is going to sell us all down the river so he can become the world’s first trillionaire.\nI pray that you are not serious. People do not become billionaires because they are honest or trustworthy. If you are willing to toss away your constitutional rights to privacy, that is your choice. Real Americans are not built that way.\nFaith is believing what you know ain’t true. – Mark Twain\nI am posting to question your comment that no benefits are being cut back. I am an 80 year old 100% service connected total and permanent disabled Viet Nam veteran. I am homebound and unable to effectively perform most of the normal activities of daily life. For most of 2024 the VA Community Care Team in Dallas Texas awarded me 58 hours a week of Home Healthcare Aid. This allowed me to enjoy a healthy lifestyle and my quality of life was very good. In August of 2024 my weekly hours were reduced to 11 hours a week and after an appeal this was increased to 13 hours a week. When the time for review and renewal for this benefit arrived in 2025 I was again awarded 13 hours. Any reasonable person can do the math and see thar 13 hours for a 7 day week equals 1.8 hours/day. As most providers require a minimum of 4 hours/day this leaves me with help for three days out of a seven day week. On many occasions when I contacted the VA about this benefit I was told that all of the veterans in this area were being cut back. No reason was given.\nThe VA needs more people, not less. It took me 1 year to get a specialist approval in the Community Care system. They don’t have enough nurses to approve cases. It’s good my issue wasn’t life threatening. Also, cuts to benefits, including disability compensation have been proposed in Project 2025, the conservative playbook that the administration appears to be following.\nDear President Trump,\nI am writing to make you aware of an injustice that has been done to veterans across the country, I left active duty in 1994 after serving 11 years as an active-duty Army officer. I was offered a bonus of $61,201.91 based on time served and my rank. Congress authorized DoD to offer these bonuses so the military could reach Congressionally-mandated force levels without involuntarily dismissals.\nThat bonus, $61,201.91, was taxed by the Internal Revenue Service by 28% ($17,136.53.), leaving my net bonus $44,065.38 which I received May 31, 1994 and my family and I used to put money down on a home and to bridge the gap between the security of a military career and the insecurity of beginning another career, which was the purpose of the bonus.\nWithin a month of leaving the Army, I received a letter from the VA stating that I was authorized 10 percent disability payments of VA Disability Compensation, $87.00 monthly at the time. The same letter told me that I would not receive that amount because I had received a separation bonus and that they would recoup my VADC until they had recouped my bonus amount. 21 years later, in 2015, the VA let me know that they had recouped the net amount of my bonus, $44,065.38 and I started receiving VADC.\nI also continued my military career in the Army Reserve – ultimately qualifying for reserve component retirement which began for me at age 60 (February 15, 2021). The Defense Finance and Accounting Service told me that they were also required to also recoup my 1994 separation bonus, less what the VA recouped.\nDFAS, however made it clear that the law allowed them to recoup the “pre-tax amount,” less what the VA recouped. So DFAS told me that the balance I owed to them was $17,136.53; that’s precisely the amount the IRS withheld in 1994.\nThe first problem is that the law doesn’t really say what DFAS says it says. DFAS interprets the law to benefit the bureaucracy. The language in the law is NOT clear, but instead of giving the benefit of the doubt to the Soldier, they give the benefit of the doubt to the government. The second problem is that DFAS cites laws, rules and policy and they claim that they have no choice but to follow the “rules” but they do not follow the same rules and policies when it requires them to do certain things.\nEssentially, Congress, DoD, DFAS, and the VA played a massive decades-long shell game to move and shift money. Congress gave DoD the money to complete that post-Cold War, 1990s drawdown with the minimum amount of financial pain to the service-person. DoD and the VA then figured out ways to get that money back and use it for other purposes.\nMy bonus has been taxed three times – once in 1994 by 28% ($17,136.53.) a second time by the VA by $44,065.38 and again in 2021 by 28% ($17,136.53) by DFAS. I’ve had to pay back to the government $78,338.44 for a bonus of $61,201.91.\nThat’s a tax rate of 125 percent. DOGE needs to look into this\nI am seeking help on this, not so much for myself, but for other veterans who are in difficult financial situations and who could truly benefit.\nHere is an online petition with more comments\nhttps://www.ipetitions.com/petition/va-recoupment-of-disable-veterans-ssbvsi-payments\nA military retirement represents much more than the dollar figure involved; it represents an acknowledgement of the sacrifice made by the Serviceperson, their family and loved ones. It represents the covenant that Soldiers, Airmen, Marines, and Sailors underwrite, endorse and embrace as free citizens of a great nation. We sign that covenant with our own blood and with the blood of our families who sacrifice in ways that are inexplicable to those unfamiliar with military service. Bureaucratic rules and processes such as the ones I described diminish in tangible and palpable ways the reciprocal feelings of goodwill, devotion, and affection that servicepeople should feel toward their Nation\nIt seems that programs like the Veterans Transportation Network would be prime targets of Musk and the Muskrats.\nVeterans with 100per cent disability get free dental care at VA. Why can’t veterans with 90 per cent disability disability be given the same preference? Can one of our representatives in Washington proposes putting forward a bill before Congress to make this a law.? Many veterans cannot afford private insurance.\nMy husband died because it took a month or longer to set him up with doctors and approve them! After he died VA denied an ambulance bill of $5,000 just because of a 72 hour rule I had never heard of! When my husband was dying and needed an ambulance do you think I would think to contact you? I informed the ambulance service that he was a veteran they should have done something! Another Joe Biden/Kamala Harris F up! That last hospital visit I was finally told after a few trips there and they claimed flu and pneumonia; was actually the last stages of cancer in his lungs and mastesized through his esophagus and other areas and had gone to his liver and kidneys! VA NEEDS a complete overhaul of doctors, administrators and all! It has gone to crap!!!!\nThis crap is Biden Harris doing’s!!!!\nFile a TORT CLAIM. You are right the hospital is supposed to contact the VA. If I’m dying how can I call the VA? I can’t!\nI’m so sorry about your husband! The VA IS totally screwed up but it always has been. I’ve had my own issues with ambulance payments, incorrect diagnoses- repeatedly for different issues and was never as happy as when I aged into Medicare and could avoid the VA most of the time! That said, this has nothing to do with who is President. The VA does it’s own thing under the VA Sec and we have had a whole lot of losers over the last 20 years and before that. And the VA Sec is restrained by the amount of money allocated by Congress. Don’t blame Biden/Harris. They inherited the VA from the past 100+years and they only had a Democratic Congress for 2 years to try and make changes. They did allocate a lot of new money for a lot of programs including the VA. The last 2 years the GOP got nothing done. And now Trump is rolling back all that money, those programs, and making deep cuts of funds and personnel. This post by Sec Collins is a bunch of BS. You wait and see.\nI too, have a Biden/Harris story. I am now a widow. The VA’s failings began long before Trump and Musk. The VA and the DOJ (grant programs)both waste serious money.\nTrump and his administration is pro service member. I have every confidence they will honor the commitment to our veterans. I am a veteran and I am a former VA employee. There are thousands like me who will stand up to anyone who tries to undo the sacred services for our fellow veterans.\nWe know there is stuff that needs to be cut and procurement regulations improved. Perhaps even high paid upper management could need trimming but I hope they retain all the dedicated staff that is high performing and needed and cut only those who aren’t.\nI welcome this opportunity to reevaluate government that so many administrations have failed to do in the past. Let this process play out.\nIt amazes me that you, as a veteran who pledged allegiance to the Constitution, pledge fealty to an unelected billionaire sociopath and sitting, draft-dodging, puppet “president”. All this, despite the literal acts of treason on Jan 6th. The ability to be so committed and vested in sociopaths who do NOT have your best interest in mind and are solely motivated to make themselves richer and more powerful at the American people’s expense is baffling to me.\nMaking the government more efficient and eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse is a fantastic goal.\nWhat this administration is doing is NOT that and if you choose to actually evaluate their actions and consequences, maybe you will understand what is happening to our country.\nNo facts. That is what you offered. You would rather have Biden? Obama? Maybe Clinton. Fraud, waste and abuse must stop. You and I paid for others to defraud the United States and to fund terrorists. So, “and if you choose to actually evaluate their” (Dems) actions and consequences, maybe ytou will understand what is happening to our country”. Surely you do not believe that our country was better with 4 years of previous administration?\nJan of 2024 Biden signed an executive order that authorized the 24/7 surveillance of all American Citizens. That is actually called the most treasonous act of any American president in history. Just saying.\nYou are not a Patriot, this is an untruth at best and more likely a lie. It wasn’t an executive order, it was an extension of the previous bill after it was re-authorized by Congress. Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is crucial in disrupting terrorist attacks, cyber intrusions, and foreign espionage and has also produced intelligence that the U.S. has relied on for specific operations, such as the 2022 killing of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri. It does NOT surveil ALL US citizens 24/7. I assume you have a reason to be concerned? I don’t.\nPlease do your research before posting incorrect information. In April 2024 President Biden signed a BILL that had bipartisan support (60-34 vote in Senate) EXTENDING a key US surveillance program (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) that was first authorized in 2008 and renewed several times since. It targets non-Americans in other countries and communications of Americans in contact with those targeted foreigners. Google it for more truthfuland educational information.\nYes, would prefer any of them over a draft dodging convicted felon.\nAnybody spouting opposition to what Trump and DOGE are doing is simply uninformed. We could not have a better, more supportive leader for this nation and our military and veterans.\nMazel Tov Secretary Doug Collins! Is there a way that us senior Veterans receiving their medications (Not narcotics) can be automatically sent without having to remember to reorder them every month or every other month? Online, mail, phone call to pharmacy, message to the primary physician is sometimes diffucult to remember and sometimes confusing?\nAsk if you can get 90 day supply and If you have an online account, when you receive your medicine go online and check the box to order a refill. According to a technician in the in hospital pharmacy, when the refill is due, it will be mailed out automatically.\nSecVA Anthony J. Principi addressed waste in a 2005 op-ed for WaPo.\nHe outlined changes that could save the government 125 billion dollars without harming veteran quality of care.\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/va-isnt-broken-but-its-in-desperate-need-of-change/2018/04/10/54cb1c0c-3c0a-11e8-a7d1-e4efec6389f0_story.html\nSo the news media is making all of this story up out of whole cloth?\n“This executive order seeks to impose severe hiring restrictions and would disproportionately harm veterans, who make up one-third of the federal workforce. Requiring agencies to hire only one new employee for every four who leave will drastically reduce VA staffing levels. At a time when the veteran population is aging and the VA’s mission has expanded under Biden, this policy will lead to massive delays and outright denials in health care, benefits processing, and disability claims – the essential services veterans depend on to survive.”\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-and-musk-are-going-to-war-against-military-veterans/ar-AA1yZkRm\nYou obviously have not read the actual order. You must be listening to MSN’s version of the facts, which are very tainted (to Left Wing propaganda). Do not be a sheep. President Trump is doing the right things, and I see nothing that DOGE is doing that will impact veterans negatively. Quite the opposite. Waste and abuse are being eliminated, money will be going where it should be now.\nDear Honorable Secretary Collins,\nCongratulations on your new assignment as the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. I am elated that you have encouraged veterans to come and see you for the truth of what is going on. In addition your promise to ensure and protect the VA from cuts with your heart and the God that you serve. According to the weekly report there are 953,078 pending VA disability claims as of February 8, 2025, and a Back Log of 254,679 claims. What is the plan to insure that there will be enough employees to continue adjuicating these claims, if many of the government employees opt out and leave Veterans Affairs or are fired? Hiring is not just a come to work, it is a long process to learn how to adjuicate claims.\nRespectfully,\nRochelle Crump,\nFormer VA Regional Office Employee, 23 years Government Service\nUnited States Womens Army Corps (WAC) Vietnam Era\nLet’s make sure that these said employees doing claims are even qualified to do so. I did a claim back in 2022 and then shortly after my claim came back with more red tape to slash, a newsletter came out from the VA stating that the personnel they had doing claims were not qualified to do them. You can find a lot of information about VA subject matter at the GAO website. Government Accountability Office.\nThank you for your service and this letter! 10 years and waiting.\nWhat’s Doug Collins’ email address?\nGreat to hear from you so candidly Honorable Collins! As a VA Nurse and a surviving Navy and Army Veteran spouse, I have some concerns and an initiative to share regarding a service members eligibility for state VA nursing home care. I would like to share some thoughts with you and or your staff. Please advise. Thank you for your service then and now!\nThank God and my Savior Jesus Christ for President Trump and Secretary Collins for their love and dedication to America and those who have and continue to serve Her and protect Her!\nCongratulations secretary Collins. You are a patriot and I know the VA will be in very capable hands under your leadership.\nI read yesterday that they may target veterans with service connected disability who also draw social security. That sounds about right for this crime family.\nCan you post the source you read this from?\nThank you Secretary Collins I hope to see you in person when you visit the Phoenix VA. Be safe and God Bless!\nMr. Collins,\nI would like to speak to you about the years of horrible healthcare I have received from the VA. This has included waiting three years and writing three different Georgia Senators to try to get help. Furthermore, I have lost coverage for six months numerous times and no one can tell me why. Please contact me at the email below to hear more. I also have an easy way to make VA Healthcare a lot better for Veterans.\nThank You Secretary Collins !!! I feel better every day now. God Bless you.\nhttps://veteranspolicy.org/post/project-2025s-war-on-veterans/\nProject 2025 plans to dismantle the VA. Read the article wake up. They are coming for veterans as well.\nMr Collins,\nI myself will hold your feet to the fire about our personal information, health records, treatments not being invaded by a non approved group(DOGE). Further, any cuts or changes to the VA benefits by the Project 2025 will fall on you! Any services that are taken away from Veterans is a complete insult by your boss! Keep your word as you would in deed!\nI don’t believe a word any of them say. There is no reason an illegal immigrate tech billionaire with no military service and multiple failed enterprises should be poking around the VA much less any part of the government.\nyou have never done anything and it Didn’t go the way you wanted?,\nDon’t believe it.

There’s the supposed compensation for this type of cancer, and for the burning of pits in Nam,, to late now, I can’t claim nothing, So they say. They were negligent\nSorry for your loss.\nIts hard to believe the the VA in not recognizing BURN PITS in Vietnam.\nThis is where the military gone its ideas to use them again in the Middle East.\nBut they recognize this damage to the soliders there, not Nam.\nSo please fix it!

How did we feel coming home where we were hated in a lot\nof places.\nJust look into an See.\nFrom the looks of some of the comments, they need to file a claim for TDS from Service connected injuries sustained by watching Fake News. Seek some help and get your 100% for Psychosis.\nYou’re acting like a child. Grow up\nAmen!! Very refreshing Sir.\nAmen brother. What a bunch of sea lawyers on here.\nThanks for the update Doug! We know you have our back and of course prepare for all the left’s Fear-Mongering. That’s all they have left and yes the gravy train is over.\nHay just went to VA at Hines in ILLINOIS I need surgery on left knee, I am 100% disabled Vietnam Veteran Marine, they said I will have to wait four months for a appointment, that is bad I need help,\nFrank Lasick Jr\nIf you don’t have Medicare or Medicaid from your State I’d highly recommend looking into it. I have always received much better health care from Medicare than the VA.\nIt’s been 16 months waiting for a dependent, my wife to. be put on my va benefits. We call the local va office in our location and they tell us it is still open\nWhy is it taking so long?\nCongrats VA Secretary Collin’s, this I will say ..say what you mean & mean what you say…personally don’t have any faith in DOGE…but now seeing is believing…Pentagon is next in line\nWOW! Congratulations Doug Collins & Thank You President Trump for realizing the Competence & Quality of this Patriotic Man from Georgia! Doug ~ I am a United States Marine Corps Veteran having served in Camp Lejeune North Carolina wherein I endured, proudly I might add, “Advanced Combat Infantry Training” > The Camp Lejeune Justice Act is intended to help Marines like myself having had to drink contaminated water ~ every hour~ every day ~ that I was stationed there in 1963 AD. I am a survivor of Colon Cancer ~ Prostate Cancer ~ Kidney Disease ~ COPD and many more illnesses. GOD has been Watching Over Me as I recently turned 90 years of age. I have participated in Monthly Zoom Webinars conducted by my Attorneys’ Wallace & Graham,Salisbury NC since I became their Client representing me in 2021AD. As of this writing very few settlements { 8%} have OCCURRED UNDER the PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. Call Me Doug when you get a chance Bob Higgins Semper Fi\nSo happy that you are the Veteran’s Secretary! Our Veterans are in good hands! Thank you Doug Collin’s and by the way, my cousin, Jim Miller, is your doppelgänger. He is a retired Texas Ranger and he not only looks just like you, he talks just like you! It is uncanny! Hope all goes well with your new position and I know you will help our Veterans fairly and improve on Veteran’s care. Charlotte Naizer. Belton, Texas\nI don’t believe anything this administration Elon, Trump or VA director say. If their lips are moving their lying.\n100 percent agree. Project 2025 talks about dismantling the VA as well. This man is just giving us lip service.\nAmen to that!\nVa and the so called benefits is bs. First I was turned down for not serving 2 years when I was just short. And now vso supposedly put in claim for me but va never received it. Lies and corruption is all it is. Vets don’t get anything. You put your life on the line so ungrateful -ss people can deny you. Then you now see why vets kill them self or blow sh-t up or just run ungrateful -ss people down. Maybe you people should give vets the positions to help vet\nNot crooked -ss politicians who just pad their pockets and screw vets\nMaybe do some research. Don’t speak for those who actually served and actually defended this country by risking our lives. You said “maybe you people should give vets the positions and help vets”.. Glad you said that because Doug Collins is in the Air Force. haha.\nNo way these comments are coming from vets. The only whiny vets I’ve heard from was from the air force\nHey buddie, I’m not whining and I am AIR FORCE\nI’m a vet and nothing but hopeful and positive feeling of the way I hope things will be, think about another 4 years of what we just had.\nCongratulations your Honorable Doug Collins I have been an admirer of you for years and know the VA is going to be enhanced with your expertise. Your Honor I do not know the staff member to send my letter to so I am sending it to you. Thank you for your past service and from here on there is no past just a future of service. We look forward to the future success you will have in the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nthis man sounds sincere.i am hoping he will do a good job..\nI am employee at a VA Hosp in California and my democrat colleagues can be disruptive to my workflow, making efficiency even worse. They cannot move on from the election result. I just want going to work and do my job. Leadership seems to tolerate since they probably have the same politics. Also, our local workers union is fear-mongering and misaligning your messages.\nI have Coumity Care and when my doctor request blood work i have to go to a private provider where the VA has a facility very close to my doctor and has a lab but will not accept me but they pay the private company $800 to do blood work\nTY Dec Collins! As a VA Hosp employee, I can say we really use some efficiency, restructuring and less woke culture.\nI agree! VA Nurse too.\nGood morning,\nIt would be nice if there was a way for us VA employees to make suggestions on ways to cut down on unnecessary procedures and wastefulness and see it followed through.\nLess woke Culture? As a nurse you dedicate your career to helping those you serve. Us veterans are very diverse and come from all ends of this country to serve and you should respect that. So if providing them with woke services is what is required to help THEM it shouldn’t be your voice who dictates what they need.\nLess woke Culture? As a nurse you dedicate your career to helping those you serve. Us veterans are very diverse and come from all ends of this country to serve and you should respect that. So if providing them with woke services is what is required to help THEM it shouldn’t be your voice who dictates what they need.\nAh, so just go get screwed to the women, black, LGBTQ, and other minority Vets that served then? If you are truly a VA Nurse, you need to get fired for not taking care of ALL of your Veterans. Woke means positive change and moving forward. Do you really want to go back into the past? Silly questions…of course, you and others like you want to. Leaning into hate is just…well, hateful and disgusting.\nCan we please get dental care for veterans using VA health care any medical problems can occur due to bad dental issues would be nice if we could use community care in my veterans get dental care as well as medical care!\nIf you go to your PCP and ask for a referral to dental due to health issues, the VA has to honor it and then dental becomes a health issue. Also check your DD214 and see if block 17 is checked yes or no. This has to do with a final dental exam upon discharge. If it is checked NO then the VA has to pick up any dental that was done in the service.\nI Coumity Care and TriWest should issue an insurance card to provider the medical staff on contact billing info\nHe doesn’t even consider us female veterans, as veterans. He’s lying because he’s a Trump loyalist in the cult. He’s one of the ones trying to tax our disability compensation.\nATTN: Dept of Veterans Affairs\n5 yrs ago I wrote to you\nNothing new here, getting fuked again by the VA I will be filing a Federal Lawsuit Against the VA for FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, FAILURE TO PAY LEGAL LAWFUL BILLS DUE AND OWING TO CIVILIAN HOSPITALS, Doctors, Nurses, Technicians, Rescue Squads, ie. The Choice Program and For Ruining my FICO SCORES and CREDIT REPUTATION due to Collection Agencies and their Harrassment. ALONG WITH THE VA, I will also name Congressman Tom O’Halleran CD 1 AZ and his Veteran Representative in Casa Grande, AZ , for not acting for over 2 years on this issue as well as individuals in the Miami VA Hospital System, Lake City Florida VA Hospital System and Tucson VA Medical Center. Lawyer up folks ’cause the paperwork is being filed.\nI want to thank the Dept of Veterans Affairs for making me HOMELESS AGAIN…After deducting more than $800 USD from my unemployable Benefit, Due to Severe Hypertension and Heart attack/Stroke risk, of which I had a STROKE this past year, they do not give a sh-t that a Veteran is HOMELESS…\nI will probably be dead before the Dept of Veterans Affairs answers any questions that I have had regarding taking over $800 from my VA Benefits…\n<<<<< Do you see the avatar of me, I am 72 years old, plagued with severe HYPERTENSION, Covid, Bacterial Pneumonia, STROKE, and Dengue this past year, I was eligible for Unemployable benefits from the Veterans Administration, this month The VA slashed over $800USD from my benefit because of Social Security that I receive…Can someone explain to me how the VA can do this? Can anyone help me?\nContact me, Thanx…\nCarlo Mathiesen\nDecember 12, 2024\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\nSt Petersburg, FL\nSubject: NEXUS Letter to Support Continued Disability Benefit Amount\nTo Whom It May Concern,\nI am writing this letter to support my request to maintain my previously approved unemployable disability benefit amount. I am a veteran and I have been experiencing multiple service-connected conditions that have significantly impaired my overall quality of life and ability to function.\nI currently suffer from the following which were not included in previous medical examinations, conditions:\n1. Tinnitus\n2. Anxiety and Depression\n3. Migraine Headaches, which cause severe symptoms, including vomiting and diarrhea simultaneously\n4. Shortness of Breath, a side effect of the medications prescribed by VA healthcare providers\nEach of these medical conditions has been well-documented by VA medical personnel and various specialists over the years. I have been under continuous treatment and care at the Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, and I am currently prescribed multiple medications to manage these symptoms. Unfortunately, these medications have introduced new complications, such as shortness of breath, which I attribute directly to the prescribed treatments.\nMy migraine headaches, which result in intense vomiting and diarrhea simultaneously, have significantly reduced my ability to engage in day-to-day activities and have made it difficult for me to maintain a stable routine. Additionally, my anxiety and depression continue to exacerbate these challenges, compounding my overall mental and physical health struggles.\nDue to these service-connected conditions, my ability to maintain consistent employment or perform routine tasks has been substantially impaired. I kindly request that the Department of Veterans Affairs reconsider and approve my continued disability benefit amount, as I rely on these benefits to manage ongoing healthcare costs, treatment, and support services.\nMy situation highlights the direct correlation between my connected disabilities and the challenges I face. Continued support will allow me access to critical medical care and ongoing treatment from VA healthcare providers who are familiar with my health history and specific needs.\nI am available to provide any additional medical documentation, treatment records, or statements from healthcare professionals who have treated me through the VA system. Please do not hesitate to contact me\nThank you very much for your time and consideration. I sincerely appreciate your support in ensuring that I continue to receive the benefits that are crucial to my ongoing treatment and well-being.\nSincerely,\nCarlo Mathiesen\nHe doesn’t even consider us female veterans, as veterans. He’s lying because he’s a Trump loyalist in the cult.\nwhy would u even say that?\nBecause it’s true. He’s part of the J6 insurrection and could care less about veterans. People need to wake up and pay attention\nBecause she is correct….\nI have a honorable discharge from the army reserve and I have been trying to get help with my veterans assistance in Meridian Ms and not to forget to mention I have disabilities while serving into the army reserve due to the fact that I was transferred to the regular army bases for my terms . I have have filed a timely claim for my benefits and compensation. But I believe archive lost all my DD214 during all my tours . It’s been 2 years old and I just been forgot about because during a peaceful term. Please let me know my status of the complaint I filed.\npissed off disabled veteran cant even post her name. thats why she can comfortably say crap. I am also a female vet. I get what I need; not more than I need. I hope all vets get what they need, not what they want. Doug Collins will hopefully properly ditch the waste and the lazy employees, and properly train the employees to all be on the same page; that I know they are not.\nLiving In Fantasy Land Sandy.

He and Musk are going to turn my USA , what I fought for, into a Regime, lead by a DICTATOR.\nAnd Biden was going to turn the USA to Communism.\nPerhaps if there is any waste or fraud in the VA or other areas, some of the recouped wealth could be used to up the wages of the vital VA workers; from guard or custodian to maintenance to nurse or even the most highly-trained neurological surgeon. Cut the waste and reward those whose efforts are so vital to keeping the veterans heathy as can be!!!\nCure for vets PTSD. On final.

I have sent forms , letters , marriage licenses and birth certificate proof and numerous calls, But they have continued to say I owe $40,00!\nWhy is it taking over 6 months to add dependents to my benefits?

(See https://static.project2025.org/2025_Manda.\nI wouldn’t trust a Trump appointee to tell the truth, even under oath. I just hope that Congress grows a pair and stops giving up their Checks and Balances powers.\nRobert Grant, thanks for the links to SPECIFIC plans. Secretary Collins believes what he says but I don’t trust his boss as far as I can throw him.\nYou rock!thank u.\nWell I think that even in the VA and veterans are socialist communists that believe all the BS the Biden administration. But I am a true patriot and with Doge and President Trump’s secretary Douglas Collins will improve on veteran needs 100%.\nWe Will Hold You To Your Word!

Hear.\nI’m in the process of suing the VA on numerous levels. Enough is enough. I am also going on local news programs about the lack of care I have received since 2010. I hope my voice will help ALL veterans that are at the behest of incompetent, lazy VA employees. Especially at VA North Texas and TriWest.\nIs it possible for veterans who have retired from the military use other pharmacies than Walgreens,CVS, Walmart or Publix because they are not in the Veteran’s best interest. When I was able to use my family pharmacy never had any problems getting my medicine. The pharmacies listed above do not care about the veterans at all.\nWhat on earth do you expect this puppet to say?\nRight on! Glad to see a critical thinker in the comments.\nRight with you! He’s a puppet of the guy who called our fallen military “suckers and losers.” A puppet of the guy who told his entourage that disfigured military veterans should not be part of veteran ceremonies. The puppetmaster has already hit the understaffed VA by firing a bunch of employees and ending contracts. Project 2025 will take away more from VA and Medicaid (and maybe even SS and Medicare) so that he and his cronies can get that sweet 15% corporate income tax rate.

When the current president berates troops who die, become prisoners of war and/or called slackers, it is difficult to trust that veterans will be honored, protected and rewarded for their service to the country. Keep an eye on your current services and future ones you may need. Even if you voted for this administration keep your eyes and ears open.\nSo how about working on the time at takes to schedule an appointment. I called the VA about a week ago to make a primary Care appointment at Fort Belvoir Virginia. I was told the soonest date that they had for an appointment would be July 15th. I mean I went ahead and schedule the appointment but that’s 5 months away you would think that they might be able to do a little better than that anyway thanks for posting on YouTube.\nHi, thanks for commenting.

Trump and To Our New VA Secretary Mr. Doug Collins…..Veterans KNOW,,,that President Trump will ALWAYS have His Loyalty, Trust, Support with EVERYTHING needed in their LIVES!!!……God Bless Our USA….Our beloved Veterans, of THE USA!! wherever WE ARE!!…….The ole saying was & still is..”Never Mess with The VETERANS of The USA”…….Freedom was never Free..It is Fought For, so AMERICA LIVES FOREVER!!!-Amen…..Thank You Mr. Secretary..& Mr. President!!…\nWow scary read through the reports on http://www.cbo.gov/budget very disturbing. We serve, retired, got injured while serving, earned VA benefits for those injuries, paid into SS for our entire lives. It’s hard to believe that anyone would even consider looking into cutting benefits for any of us. We have paid for these benefits in ways that are not imaginable to someone that hasnt served. Take away benefits when I turn 67 seriously? I paid for one my entire life and earned the other risking my life for this country.\nDamn.. page not found. They took the budget down. Hopefully someone copied it.\nSir,\nIs DOGE, vetted?, how many actual Veterans in DOGE, if zero, they should hit the f*cking door because penny counters don’t know the journey.\nAlso could you put up photos and qualifications of the DOGE inspectors.Let be leaders by doing what is promised “transparency” and not generic statements like “hitting the ground running” when we all know the clear destination of your running matters.\nThank you for asking these very important questions!! I fear dependent Chapter 35 benefits are on the table, too.\nThis is all just messaging, not factual information. Why don’t you answer the following, Dougie:\n1. Do you support means-testing for eligibility for VA disability compensation, as outlined in the report at https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60915?\n2. Do you support ending VA’s Individual Unemployability Payments to Disabled Veterans at the Full Retirement Age for Social Security as found in the report at https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60916?\n3. Do you support VA’s Disability Payments being included as Taxable Income, as found at https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/60947?\n4. What planned changes are you advocating for on the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities that affects our disability payments, as laid out in Project 2025 that says you want to partially cut benefits for Veterans? (See https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf)\nVeterans…do not be fooled by these talking points. He wants to cut facilities and your benefits. Contact your Congressional members now to tell him cuts are a non-starter.\nExactly. So many Vets are convinced their benefits won’t be touched. Are they ok if their dependents lose Chapter 35?\nIs it possible for veterans who have retired from the military use other pharmacies than Walgreens,CVS, Walmart or Publix because they are not in the Veteran’s best interest. When I was able to use my family pharmacy never had any problems getting my medicine. The pharmacies listed above do not care about the veterans at all.\nGet up off your knees and raise your head. Praising a dictator is not in the job description of a VA Secretary. We’ve heard too many lies from the “king“ and his serfs. It’s not what you say, it’s what you do. We’ll be watching.\nRelevant and important information. Thanks for asking and addressing this propagandist BS\nWhat a bunch of malarkey. We’ve been lied to by this whole administration. We wanted a better economy, not this dog and pony show of renaming bodies of water and stopping benefits from other people. Every cabinet member lied bold faced to Congress, so I don’t think this secretary is any different. He’s a big fan of contracting out medical care to the public sector, which is not equipped to take on the entire veteran population. I don’t doubt he won’t start chopping out the low performing employees, but he sure won’t replace them either. You like waiting 8 months for a dependency claim? Try 2 years after they get done firing everyone. Want hour long wait time for a phone call where you get to talk to a heavy accent foreigner? Or a robot? This Secretary will be the one to do it.\nCall your Members of Congress and hold this guy’s feet to the fire.\nNotice how he first addressed the media and not veteran’s concerns? This is a fascist move…..I don’t believe a word out of this man’s mouth.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}
