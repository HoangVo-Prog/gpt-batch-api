During the pandemic, the coverage expansions put in place by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including Medicaid expansion and subsidized Marketplace coverage, served as a safety net for people who experienced economic and coverage disruptions. Gains in Medicaid and Marketplace coverage contributed to significant declines in the uninsured rate through 2022. Although states began the process of unwinding continuous enrollment in Medicaid in April 2023 and resumed disenrolling people from Medicaid, the full effect of Medicaid disenrollments were not felt in 2023. In addition, the enhanced Marketplace subsidies, which were extended through 2025, remained in place. Both these factors contributed to maintaining most of the coverage gains experienced during the pandemic period in 2023.\nThis issue brief describes trends in health coverage in 2023, examines the characteristics of the uninsured population ages 0-64, and summarizes the access and financial implications of not having coverage. Using data from the American Community Survey (ACS), this analysis examines changes in health coverage from 2022 to 2023 and compares data for 2023 to data for 2019 to report on coverage trends during the pandemic and through the start of the unwinding of the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision. Because of disruptions in data collection during the pandemic, the Census Bureau did not release 1-year ACS estimates in 2020. The analysis focuses on coverage among people ages 0-64 since Medicare offers near universal coverage for people ages 65 and older, with just 457,000, or less than 1%, of people over age 65 uninsured.\nKey Takeaways\n- How many people are uninsured: Despite the unwinding of the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision that began in April 2023, the number of people ages 0-64 who were uninsured held steady at 25.3 million in 2023. However, the number of uninsured children increased from 3.8 million in 2022 to 4.0 million in 2023. Compared to 2019, the number of people who were uninsured declined by 3.6 million.\n- Who is uninsured: Most uninsured people are in low-income families and have at least one worker in the family. Reflecting the more limited availability of public coverage in some states, adults ages 19-64 are more likely to be uninsured than children. Despite gains across groups over time, racial and ethnic disparities in coverage persist.\n- Why are people uninsured: Many uninsured people cite the high cost of insurance as the main reason they lack coverage. In 2023, 63% of uninsured adults ages 18-64 said that they were uninsured because the cost of coverage was too high. Many uninsured people do not have access to coverage through a job, and some people, particularly poor adults in states that have not expanded Medicaid, remain ineligible for financial assistance for coverage. Although over half of people who are uninsured may be eligible for Medicaid or subsidized coverage in the Marketplaces, they may not be aware of these coverage options or may face barriers to enrolling. In some cases, even with subsidies, Marketplace coverage may not be affordable.\n- How does not having coverage affect health care access: People without insurance coverage are less likely to access care and more likely to delay or forgo care because of costs. Although difficult to establish direct causality, research has linked Medicaid expansion to improved health outcomes, including lower mortality rates from cancer, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and maternal mortality.\n- What are the financial implications of being uninsured: Uninsured people often face unaffordable medical bills when they do seek care. Nearly half (49%) of uninsured adults say they have difficulty affording health care costs, more than double the share of those with private insurance (21%). These costs can quickly translate into medical debt since most people who are uninsured have low or moderate incomes and have little, if any, savings. More than six in ten (62%) uninsured adults report having health care debt compared to over four in ten (44%) insured adults.\nAlthough coverage rates for the overall population ages 0-64 held steady in 2023, future changes to Medicaid and Marketplace coverage could have a significant impact on health coverage. Proposals that would alter how Medicaid is financed or that would impose work requirements on certain adults enrolled in the program would likely lead to a loss of Medicaid coverage. Moreover, the temporary enhanced Marketplace subsidies will expire after 2025 unless Congress acts. Without a permanent extension, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the number of uninsured people will increase by 3.8 million, on average, in each year from 2026 to 2034. The combined Medicaid and Marketplace coverage losses could lead to a sizable increase in the number of people who are uninsured. In turn, the loss of coverage could have implications for access to care and financial stability associated with having health coverage and could lead to a worsening of disparities in health outcomes.\nHow many people are uninsured?\nAmong the population ages 0-64, both the number of uninsured (25.3 million) and the uninsured rate (9.5%) remained at historic lows in 2023. A continued decline in the number of uninsured adults ages 19-64 was offset by an increase in the number of uninsured children. Compared to 2019, prior to the start of the pandemic, the number of uninsured and the uninsured rate for the population ages 0-64 were both significantly lower in 2023. Nearly all groups experienced coverage gains, but American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) and Hispanic people had larger gains than their White counterparts and low-income individuals and those in working families had bigger gains than those at higher incomes and those without a worker in the family.\nKey Details:\n- In 2023, 25.3 million people ages 0 to 64 were uninsured, and the uninsured rate for this population was 9.5%, both statistically unchanged from 2022. While the uninsured rate held steady from 2022, it was lower than in 2019 (10.9%) prior to the start of the coronavirus pandemic (Figure 1).\n- From 2019-2023, the uninsured rate declined by 1.4%, driven primarily by gains in Medicaid and Marketplace coverage because of pandemic-era coverage protections. The Medicaid continuous enrollment provision required states to keep people enrolled in Medicaid during the pandemic in exchange for enhanced federal funding and enhanced ACA Marketplace subsidies, first enacted in the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and renewed through 2025 in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Although the enhanced Marketplace subsidies remained in effect in 2023, Medicaid continuous enrollment ended on March 31, 2023, and states resumed disenrolling people from Medicaid, though the full effects of the disenrollments were not felt in 2023. During this time period, employer coverage declined by 0.5% (Figure 2).\n- While there was no change in the uninsured rate for the overall population ages 0 to 64 in 2023, the share of children 18 and younger without insurance increased from 5.1% in 2022 to 5.3% in 2023. At the same time, the uninsured rate for adults ages 19 to 64 decreased to 11.1% in 2023 from 11.3% the previous year (Figure 2). An increase in Medicaid coverage for adults 19-64 from 16.3% to 16.5% in 2023 drove the decline in the uninsured rate for this group. Despite the uptick in the uninsured rate for children in 2023, the share of children without health insurance coverage was still lower in 2023 compared to 2019.\n- Although nearly all groups experienced coverage gains during the pandemic-period, they were largest for AIAN and Hispanic people and individuals in low-income families. From 2019 to 2023, the uninsured rate for AIAN people fell 3.0 percentage points (from 21.7% to 18.7%) and the uninsured rate for Hispanic people decreased by 2.1 percentage points (from 20.0% to 17.9%), although these groups remain more likely to be uninsured than their White counterparts. Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (NHPI) people did not experience a significant decline in the uninsured rate during this period, which may, in part, reflect the smaller sample size for NHPI people, which limits the power to detect statistically significant differences. While the uninsured rate dropped for people at all income levels, individuals in low-income families1 experienced the largest declines. From 2019-2023, the uninsured rate for poor individuals dropped 2.2 percentage points (18.0% to 15.8%) and 2.7 percentage points for individuals with income 100-199% FPL (18.2% to 15.5%, Figure 3).\n- From 2022 to 2023, the uninsured rate for the population ages 0 to 64 fell in six states (Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Missouri, North Dakota, and Oregon) but increased in two states, Iowa and Idaho (Appendix Table A). At the same time, the uninsured rate for children increased in six states (Alabama, Idaho, New Mexico, South Carolina, Texas, and Washington). While these changes occurred in both expansion and non-expansion states, the uninsured rate was lower in expansion states (7.6%) compared to non-expansion states (14.1%) in 2023 (Figure 6).\nWho is uninsured?\nMost of the 25.3 million people ages 0-64 who are uninsured are adults, in working low-income families, and are people of color. Reflecting geographic variation in income and the availability of public coverage, most uninsured people live in the South or West. In addition, most who are uninsured have been without coverage for long periods of time. (See Appendix Table B for detailed data on characteristics of the uninsured population.)\nKey Details:\n- In 2023, of the total uninsured population ages 0 to 64, nearly three in four (73.7%) had at least one full-time worker in their family, and 11.2% had a part-time worker in their family (Figure 4). More than eight in ten (80.9%) uninsured people were in families with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level, and nearly half (46.6%) had incomes below 200% FPL. White people made up 37.1% of the uninsured, and the remaining 62.9% included Hispanic (41.1%), Black (12.5%), and Asian (3.7%) people and people of other racial or ethnic backgrounds (Figure 4). Most uninsured individuals (74.2%) were U.S. citizens, while 25.8% were noncitizens. Almost three-quarters (73.9%) of uninsured people lived in the South or West.\n- Adults ages 19 to 64 are more likely to be uninsured than children. In 2023, the uninsured rate for children was 5.3%, less than half the rate for adults at 11.1%.\n- Uninsured rates in the U.S. still show clear racial and ethnic disparities. In 2023, 17.9% of Hispanic people and 18.7% of AIAN people ages 0 to 64 were uninsured—more than two and a half times the rate for White people (6.5%). Asian individuals had the lowest uninsured rate at 5.8%.\n- Noncitizens are more likely than citizens to be uninsured. Nearly one-third of noncitizen immigrants were uninsured in 2023, while the uninsured rate for U.S.-born citizens was 7.5% and 8.9% for naturalized citizens. (Appendix Table B).\n- Uninsured rates vary by state and by region; individuals living in non-expansion states are more likely to be uninsured (Figure 6). Six of the ten states with the highest uninsured rates in 2023 were non-expansion states (Figure 5 and Appendix Table A).\n- Nearly two-thirds (64%) of people who were uninsured in 2023 have been without coverage for more than a year.2 People who have been without coverage for long periods may be particularly hard to reach through outreach and enrollment efforts.\nWhy are people uninsured?\nLack of access to affordable health coverage is the main reason many people say they are uninsured. A majority of working age adults in the U.S. obtain health insurance through an employer; however, not all workers are offered employer-sponsored coverage or, if offered, can afford their share of the premiums. Medicaid covers many low-income individuals, especially children, but Medicaid eligibility for adults remains limited in most states that have not adopted the ACA expansion. Marketplace subsidies make coverage more affordable for many, but even subsidized Marketplace coverage can be unaffordable for some, and few people can afford to purchase private coverage without financial assistance.\nKey Details:\n- Cost is the most commonly cited reason for being uninsured. In 2023, 63.2% of uninsured adults ages 18-64 said they were uninsured because coverage is not affordable (Figure 7). Other reasons included not being eligible for coverage (27.0%), not needing or wanting coverage (26.6%), and signing up being too difficult (23.9%).\n- Not all workers have access to coverage through their job. In 2023, 64.7% of uninsured workers worked for an employer that did not offer them health benefits.3 Among uninsured workers who are offered coverage by their employers, cost is often a barrier to taking up the offer. From 2014 to 2024, total premiums for family coverage increased by 52%, outpacing wage growth, and the worker’s share increased by 31%.4 Low-income families with employer-based coverage spend a significantly higher share of their income toward premiums and out-of-pocket medical expenses compared to those with income above 200% FPL.5 Particularly among people working for small employers , premium contributions for dependents can be unaffordable.\n- Medicaid eligibility varies across states and eligibility for adults is limited in states that have not expanded Medicaid. As of December 2024, 41 states including DC had adopted the ACA Medicaid expansion. Two states implemented the expansion in 2023—South Dakota in July and North Carolina in December. In states that have not expanded Medicaid, the median eligibility level for parents is just 34% FPL and adults without dependent children are ineligible in most cases. Additionally, in non-expansion states, millions of poor uninsured adults fall into a “coverage gap” because they earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to qualify for Marketplace premium tax credits.\n- Many lawfully present immigrants must meet a five-year waiting period after receiving qualified immigration status before they can qualify for Medicaid. States have the option to cover eligible children and pregnant people without a waiting period, and as of May 2024, 37 states have elected the option for children and 31 states have taken up the option for pregnant individuals. Lawfully present immigrants, including those who are not eligible for Medicaid because they have not met the five-year waiting period, are eligible for Marketplace tax credits. However, Some states have taken steps to provide fully state-funded coverage to some or all immigrants who are not eligible for federal coverage.\n- Though financial assistance is available under the ACA to many of the remaining uninsured, not everyone who is uninsured is eligible for free or subsidized coverage. Nearly six in ten (14.5 million) uninsured individuals in 2023 were eligible for financial assistance either through Medicaid or through subsidized Marketplace coverage (Figure 8). However, over four in ten uninsured (10.9 million) are outside the reach of the ACA because their state did not expand Medicaid, they have an ineligible immigration status, or they were deemed to have access to an affordable Marketplace plan or offer of employer coverage.\nHow does not having coverage affect health care access?\nHealth insurance makes a difference in whether and when people get necessary medical care, where they get their care, and ultimately, how healthy they are. Uninsured adults are far more likely than those with insurance to postpone health care or forgo it altogether because of concerns over costs. The consequences can be severe, particularly when preventable conditions or chronic diseases go undetected.\nKey Details:\n- Uninsured adults are more likely to forgo needed care than their insured counterparts. In 2023, nearly half (46.6%) of uninsured adults ages 18 to 64 reported not seeing a doctor or health care professional in the past 12 months compared to 15.6% with private insurance and 14.2% with public coverage. Part of the reason for not accessing care among uninsured individuals is that many (42.8%) do not have a regular place to go when they are sick or need medical advice (Figure 9). But cost also plays a role. Over one in five (22.6%) adults without coverage said that they went without needed care in the past year because of cost compared to 5.1% of adults with private coverage and 7.7% of adults with public coverage. A KFF survey that asks about cost barriers for individuals and their family members reports higher percentages of both uninsured and insured people delaying or forgoing needed care due to cost.\n- Uninsured children were also more likely than those with private insurance or public insurance to go without needed care due to cost in 2023 (9.5% compared to 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively). Furthermore, over a quarter (27.4%) of uninsured children had not seen a doctor in the past year, compared to 4.8% of children with public coverage and 3.7% of those with private coverage (Figure 9).\n- Studies repeatedly demonstrate that uninsured individuals are less likely than those with insurance to receive preventive care and services for major health conditions and chronic diseases.6 ,7 ,8 ,9 Because people without health coverage are less likely than those with insurance to have regular outpatient care, they are more likely to be hospitalized for avoidable health problems and to experience declines in their overall health. When they are hospitalized, uninsured people receive fewer diagnostic and therapeutic services and also have higher mortality rates than those with insurance.10 ,11 ,12 ,13 ,14\n- Research demonstrates that gaining health insurance improves access to health care considerably and diminishes the adverse effects of having been uninsured. A review of research on the effects of the ACA Medicaid expansion finds that expansion led to positive effects on access to care, utilization of services, the affordability of care, and financial security among the low-income population.\n- More recent research generally shows Medicaid expansion is associated with improved health outcomes, although establishing direct causality between health insurance and health outcomes is complex. For example, Medicaid expansion is associated with increased early-stage diagnosis rates for cancer, lower rates of cardiovascular mortality, and increased odds of tobacco cessation.15 ,16 Medicaid expansion has also been linked to lower mortality rates, including those from cancer, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and maternal mortality.17 ,18 Evidence suggests it also aids long-term recovery for substance use disorders and improves treatment management for conditions such as diabetes and HIV.\n- Public hospitals, community clinics and health centers, and local providers that serve underserved communities provide an important health care safety net for uninsured people. However, safety net providers have limited resources and service capacity, and not all uninsured people have geographic access to a safety net provider.19 ,20 ,21 High uninsured rates contribute to rural hospital closures and greater financial challenges for rural hospitals, leaving individuals living in rural areas at an even greater disadvantage to accessing care.22 ,23 Research indicates that Medicaid expansion is associated with reductions in uncompensated care costs and improved financial performance for rural hospitals and other providers.\nWhat are the financial implications of being uninsured?\nUninsured individuals often face unaffordable medical bills when they do seek care. These bills can quickly translate into medical debt since most people who are uninsured have low or moderate incomes and have little, if any, savings.\nKey Details:\n- Those without insurance for an entire calendar year pay for almost 40% of their care out-of-pocket.24 In addition, hospitals frequently charge uninsured patients higher rates than those paid by private health insurers and public programs.25 ,26 ,27 ,28\n- Uninsured adults ages 18 to 64 are much more likely than their insured counterparts to lack confidence in their ability to afford usual medical costs. Nearly half (49%) of uninsured adults said they or a family member had problems paying for health care compared to 21% of insured adults, and over eight in ten (84%) uninsured adults said they worried that health care costs would put them in debt or increase their existing debt, compared to 71% of adults with insurance (Figure 10).\n- Unaffordable medical bills can lead to medical debt, particularly for uninsured adults. More than six in ten (62%) uninsured adults report having health care debt compared to over four in ten (44%) insured adults. Uninsured adults are more likely to face negative consequences due to health care debt, such as using up savings, having difficulty paying other living expenses, or borrowing money.29 ,30 ,31\n- While federal and state laws require certain hospitals to provide some level of charity care, not all eligible patients benefit from these programs. Consequently, charity care costs represent a small share of operating expenses at many hospitals.\n- Research suggests that gaining health coverage improves the affordability of care and financial security among the low-income population. Multiple studies of the ACA found declines in trouble paying medical bills and reductions in medical debt in expansion states relative to non-expansion states. More recent research found that Medicaid expansion decreased catastrophic health expenditures and was associated with greater increases in income among low-income individuals.\nAppendix\nSupplemental Tables\nEndnotes\n- The Federal Poverty Level was $ 24,526 for a family of three in 2023. ↩︎\n- Cohen RA and Sohi IS. “Demographic Variation in Health Insurance Coverage: United States, 2023”, National Center for Health Statistics.

LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST AB 1522, Gonzalez. Employment: paid sick days. Existing law authorizes employers to provide their employees paid sick leave. This bill would enact the Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act of 2014 to provide that an employee who, on or after July 1, 2015, works in California for 30 or more days within a year from the commencement of employment is entitled to paid sick days for prescribed purposes, to be accrued at a rate of no less than one hour for every 30 hours worked. An employee would be entitled to use accrued sick days beginning on the 90th day of employment. The bill would authorize an employer to limit an employee's use of paid sick days to 24 hours or 3 days in each year of employment. The bill would prohibit an employer from discriminating or retaliating against an employee who requests paid sick days. The bill would require employers to satisfy specified posting and notice and recordkeeping requirements. The bill would define terms for those purposes. The bill would require the Labor Commissioner to enforce these requirements, including the investigation, mitigation, and relief of violations of these requirements. The bill would authorize the Labor Commissioner to impose specified administrative fines for violations and would authorize the commissioner or the Attorney General to recover specified civil penalties against an offender who violated these provisions on behalf of the aggrieved, as well as attorney's fees, costs, and interest. The bill would not apply to certain categories of employees that meet specified requirements. THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS: SECTION 1. The Legislature finds and declares the following: (a) Nearly every worker in the State of California will at some time during the year need some time off from work to take care of his or her own health or the health of family members. (b) Many workers in California do not have any paid sick days, or have an inadequate number of paid sick days, to care for their own health or the health of family members. (c) Low-income workers are significantly less likely to have paid sick time than other workers. (d) Providing workers time off to attend to their own health care and the health care of family members will ensure a healthier and more productive workforce in California. (e) Paid sick days will have an enormously positive impact on the public health of Californians by allowing sick workers paid time off to care for themselves when ill, thus lessening their recovery time and reducing the likelihood of spreading illness to other members of the workforce. (f) Paid sick days will allow parents to provide personal care for their sick children. Parental care ensures children's speedy recovery, prevents more serious illnesses, and improves children's overall mental and physical health. (g) Providing paid sick days is affordable for employers and good for business. (h) Employers who provide paid sick days enjoy greater employee retention and reduce the likelihood of employees coming to work sick. Studies have shown that costs of decreased productivity caused by sick workers exceed the costs of employee absenteeism. (i) Many adults have significant elder care responsibilities requiring them to take time off from work or to work reduced hours. (j) Employees frequently lose their jobs or are disciplined for taking sick days to care for sick family members or to recover from their own illnesses. (k) Workers whose jobs involve significant contact with the public, such as service workers and restaurant workers, are very unlikely to have paid sick days. Often, these workers have no choice but to come to work when they are ill, thereby spreading illness to coworkers and customers. (l) Domestic violence and sexual assault affect many persons without regard to age, race, national origin, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status. (m) Domestic violence is a crime that has a devastating effect on families, communities, and the workplace. It impacts productivity, effectiveness, absenteeism, and employee turnover in the workplace. The National Crime Survey estimates that 175,000 days of work each year are missed due to domestic violence. (n) Survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault may be vulnerable at work when trying to end an abusive relationship because the workplace may be the only place where the perpetrator knows to contact the victim. Studies show that up to one-half of domestic violence victims experience job loss. Forty percent reported on-the-job harassment. Nearly 50 percent of sexual assault survivors lose their jobs or are forced to quit in the aftermath of the assaults. (o) Affording survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault paid sick days is vital to their independence and recovery. SEC. 2. In enacting this act, it is the intent of the Legislature to do the following: (a) Ensure that workers in California can address their own health needs and the health needs of their families by requiring employers to provide a minimum level of paid sick days including time for family care. (b) Decrease public and private health care costs in California by enabling workers to seek early and routine medical care for themselves and their family members and to address domestic violence or sexual assault. (c) Protect employees in California from losing their jobs while they use sick days to care for themselves or their families. (d) Provide economic security to employees in California who take time off from work for reasons related to domestic violence or sexual assault. (e) Safeguard the welfare, health, safety, and prosperity of the people of and visitors to California. SEC. 3. Article 1.5 (commencing with Section 245) is added to Chapter 1 of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Labor Code, to read: Article 1.5. Paid Sick Days 245. (a) This article shall be known and may be cited as the Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act of 2014.

(d) \"Health care provider\" has the same meaning as defined in paragraph (6) of subdivision (c) of Section 12945.2 of the Government Code. (e) \"Paid sick days\" means time that is compensated at the same wage as the employee normally earns during regular work hours and is provided by an employer to an employee for the purposes described in Section 246.5. 246. (a) An employee who, on or after July 1, 2015, works in California for 30 or more days within a year from the commencement of employment is entitled to paid sick days as specified in this section. (b) (1) An employee shall accrue paid sick days at the rate of not less than one hour per every 30 hours worked, beginning at the commencement of employment or the operative date of this article, whichever is later. (2) An employee who is exempt from overtime requirements as an administrative, executive, or professional employee under a wage order of the Industrial Welfare Commission is deemed to work 40 hours per workweek for the purposes of this section, unless the employee's normal workweek is less than 40 hours, in which case the employee shall accrue paid sick days based upon that normal workweek. (c) An employee shall be entitled to use accrued paid sick days beginning on the 90th day of employment, after which day the employee may use paid sick days as they are accrued. (d) Accrued paid sick days shall carry over to the following year of employment. However, an employer may limit an employee's use of paid sick days to 24 hours or three days in each year of employment. This section shall be satisfied and no accrual or carry over is required if the full amount of leave is received at the beginning of each year, in accordance with subdivision (e). (e) An employer is not required to provide additional paid sick days pursuant to this section if the employer has a paid leave policy or paid time off policy, the employer makes available an amount of leave that may be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions as specified in this section, and the policy does either of the following: (1) Satisfies the accrual, carry over, and use requirements of this section.

(f) (1) Except as specified in paragraph (2), an employer is not required to provide compensation to an employee for accrued, unused paid sick days upon termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation from employment. (2) If an employee separates from an employer and is rehired by the employer within one year from the date of separation, previously accrued and unused paid sick days shall be reinstated. The employee shall be entitled to use those previously accrued and unused paid sick days and to accrue additional paid sick days upon rehiring. (g) An employer may lend paid sick days to an employee in advance of accrual, at the employer's discretion and with proper documentation. (h) An employer shall provide an employee with written notice that sets forth the amount of paid sick leave available, or paid time off leave an employer provides in lieu of sick leave, for use on either the employee's itemized wage statement described in Section 226 or in a separate writing provided on the designated pay date with the employee's payment of wages. The penalties described in this article for a violation of this subdivision shall be in lieu of the penalties for a violation of Section 226. (i) An employer has no obligation under this section to allow an employee's total accrual of paid sick leave to exceed 48 hours or 6 days, provided that an employee's rights to accrue and use paid sick leave under this section are not otherwise limited. (j) An employee may determine how much paid sick leave he or she needs to use, provided that an employer may set a reasonable minimum increment, not to exceed two hours, for the use of paid sick leave. (k) The rate of pay shall be the employee's hourly wage. If the employee in the 90 days of employment before taking accrued sick leave had different hourly pay rates, was paid by commission or piece rate, or was a nonexempt salaried employee, then the rate of pay shall be calculated by dividing the employee's total wages, not including overtime premium pay, by the employee's total hours worked in the full pay periods of the prior 90 days of employment. (l) If the need for paid sick leave is foreseeable, the employee shall provide reasonable advance notification. If the need for paid sick leave is unforeseeable, the employee shall provide notice of the need for the leave as soon as practicable.

(b) An employer shall not require as a condition of using paid sick days that the employee search for or find a replacement worker to cover the days during which the employee uses paid sick days. (c) (1) An employer shall not deny an employee the right to use accrued sick days, discharge, threaten to discharge, demote, suspend, or in any manner discriminate against an employee for using accrued sick days, attempting to exercise the right to use accrued sick days, filing a complaint with the department or alleging a violation of this article, cooperating in an investigation or prosecution of an alleged violation of this article, or opposing any policy or practice or act that is prohibited by this article.

An employer shall keep for at least three years records documenting the hours worked and paid sick days accrued and used by an employee, and shall allow the Labor Commissioner to access these records pursuant to the requirements set forth in Section 1174. An employer shall make these records available to an employee in the same manner as described in Section 226. If an employer does not maintain adequate records pursuant to this section, it shall be presumed that the employee is entitled to the maximum number of hours accruable under this article, unless the employer can show otherwise by clear and convincing evidence. 248.5. (a) The Labor Commissioner shall enforce this article, including investigating an alleged violation, and ordering appropriate temporary relief to mitigate the violation or to maintain the status quo pending the completion of a full investigation or hearing. (b) (1) If the Labor Commissioner, after a hearing that contains adequate safeguards to ensure that the parties are afforded due process, determines that a violation of this article has occurred, he or she may order any appropriate relief, including reinstatement, backpay, the payment of sick days unlawfully withheld, and the payment of an additional sum in the form of an administrative penalty to an employee or other person whose rights under this article were violated. (2) If paid sick days were unlawfully withheld, the dollar amount of paid sick days withheld from the employee multiplied by three, or two hundred fifty dollars ($250), whichever amount is greater, but not to exceed an aggregate penalty of four thousand dollars ($4,000), shall be included in the administrative penalty. (3) If a violation of this article results in other harm to the employee or person, such as discharge from employment, or otherwise results in a violation of the rights of the employee or person, the administrative penalty shall include a sum of fifty dollars ($50) for each day or portion thereof that the violation occurred or continued, not to exceed an aggregate penalty of four thousand dollars ($4,000). (c) Where prompt compliance by an employer is not forthcoming, the Labor Commissioner may take any appropriate enforcement action to secure compliance, including the filing of a civil action.

(d) An employee or other person may report to the Labor Commissioner a suspected violation of this article. The commissioner shall encourage reporting pursuant to this subdivision by keeping confidential, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the name and other identifying information of the employee or person reporting the violation. However, the commissioner may disclose that person's name and identifying information as necessary to enforce this article or for other appropriate purposes, upon the authorization of that person. (e) The Labor Commissioner or the Attorney General may bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the employer or other person violating this article and, upon prevailing, shall be entitled to collect legal or equitable relief on behalf of the aggrieved as may be appropriate to remedy the violation, including reinstatement, backpay, the payment of sick days unlawfully withheld, the payment of an additional sum, not to exceed an aggregate penalty of four thousand dollars ($4,000), as liquidated damages in the amount of fifty dollars ($50) to each employee or person whose rights under this article were violated for each day or portion thereof that the violation occurred or continued, plus, if the employer has unlawfully withheld paid sick days to an employee, the dollar amount of paid sick days withheld from the employee multiplied by three; or two hundred fifty dollars ($250), whichever amount is greater; and reinstatement in employment or injunctive relief; and further shall be awarded reasonable attorney's fees and costs, provided, however, that any person or entity enforcing this article on behalf of the public as provided for under applicable state law shall, upon prevailing, be entitled only to equitable, injunctive, or restitutionary relief, and reasonable attorney's fees and costs. (f) In an administrative or civil action brought under this article, the Labor Commissioner or court, as the case may be, shall award interest on all amounts due and unpaid at the rate of interest specified in subdivision (b) of Section 3289 of the Civil Code. (g) The remedies, penalties, and procedures provided under this article are cumulative. (h) An employer shall not be assessed any penalty or liquidated damages under this article due to an isolated and unintentional payroll error or written notice error that is a clerical or an inadvertent mistake regarding the accrual or available use of paid sick leave. In reviewing for compliance with this section, the factfinder may consider as a relevant factor whether the employer, prior to an alleged violation, has adopted and is in compliance with a set of policies, procedures, and practices that fully comply with this section. 249. (a) This article does not limit or affect any laws guaranteeing the privacy of health information, or information related to domestic violence or sexual assault, regarding an employee or employee's family member. That information shall be treated as confidential and shall not be disclosed to any person except to the affected employee, or as required by law. (b) This article shall not be construed to discourage or prohibit an employer from the adoption or retention of a paid sick days policy more generous than the one required herein. (c) This article does not lessen the obligation of an employer to comply with a contract, collective bargaining agreement, employment benefit plan, or other agreement providing more generous sick days to an employee than required herein. (d) This article establishes minimum requirements pertaining to paid sick days and does not preempt, limit, or otherwise affect the applicability of any other law, regulation, requirement, policy, or standard that provides for greater accrual or use by employees of sick days, whether paid or unpaid, or that extends other protections to an employee. SEC. 4. Section 2810.5 of the Labor Code is amended to read: 2810.5. (a) (1) At the time of hiring, an employer shall provide to each employee a written notice, in the language the employer normally uses to communicate employment-related information to the employee, containing the following information: (A) The rate or rates of pay and basis thereof, whether paid by the hour, shift, day, week, salary, piece, commission, or otherwise, including any rates for overtime, as applicable. (B) Allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage, including meal or lodging allowances. (C) The regular payday designated by the employer in accordance with the requirements of this code. (D) The name of the employer, including any \"doing business as\" names used by the employer. (E) The physical address of the employer's main office or principal place of business, and a mailing address, if different. (F) The telephone number of the employer. (G) The name, address, and telephone number of the employer's workers' compensation insurance carrier. (H) That an employee: may accrue and use sick leave; has a right to request and use accrued paid sick leave; may not be terminated or retaliated against for using or requesting the use of accrued paid sick leave; and has the right to file a complaint against an employer who retaliates. (I) Any other information the Labor Commissioner deems material and necessary. (2) The Labor Commissioner shall prepare a template that complies with the requirements of paragraph (1). The template shall be made available to employers in such manner as determined by the Labor Commissioner. (3) If the employer is a temporary services employer, as defined in Section 201.3, the notice described in paragraph (1) must also include the name, the physical address of the main office, the mailing address if different from the physical address of the main office, and the telephone number of the legal entity for whom the employee will perform work, and any other information the Labor Commissioner deems material and necessary. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to a security services company that is licensed by the Department of Consumer Affairs and that solely provides security services. (b) An employer shall notify his or her employees in writing of any changes to the information set forth in the notice within seven calendar days after the time of the changes, unless one of the following applies: (1) All changes are reflected on a timely wage statement furnished in accordance with Section 226.

(2) An employee who is exempt from the payment of overtime wages by statute or the wage orders of the Industrial Welfare Commission. (3) An employee who is covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement if the agreement expressly provides for the wages, hours of work, and working conditions of the employee, and if the agreement provides premium wage rates for all overtime hours worked and a regular hourly rate of pay for those employees of not less than 30 percent more than the state minimum wage.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Employers are required to give employees notice of sick time laws. Download the sick time poster from our\nrequired postings page.\nOregon sick time law requires employers to notify all employees at least quarterly of their unused sick time balances. Many employers simply include this on the regular paycheck stub, but more information and a sample template on quarterly notice can be found here.\n- What is sick time?\n\"Sick time\" is protected time during which an employee is permitted to be absent from work without disciplinary consequences or a reduction in benefits, including but not limited to health care benefits that the employee earns from the employer.\n\"Paid sick time\" is sick time that is compensated at the employee’s regular rate of pay and without reductions in benefits, including but not limited to health care benefits that the employee earns from the employer at the time the employee uses the paid sick time.\n- Which employers are covered?\nCovered employers include any person or entity that employs one or more employees working anywhere in the state of Oregon. This does not include the federal government.\n- Who is an eligible employee?\nAn eligible \"employee\" is an individual who renders personal services at a fixed rate to an employer. This does not include employees who receive paid sick time under federal law, independent contractors, a participant in a work training program administered under a state or federal assistance program, a participant in a work-study program, railroad workers exempt under the federal Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, and individuals employed by that individual’s parent, spouse, or child.\n- I see sick time protections change if I have 10 or more employees. What if I have 11 employees, but only for a short period of time as seasonal workers?\nAll employees employed by the employer (full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary) must be counted for purposes of determining the number of employees. The number of employees is calculated based on the average number of employees employed by an employer during each of any 20 workweeks in the calendar or fiscal year immediately preceding the year in which an employee's sick time is to be taken.\nIf an employer had 20 weeks (not necessarily consecutive) in which the daily average was 10 or more (six or more anywhere in the state for employers with operations in Portland), the employer’s employees are entitled to paid sick time. Employers should look at the previous year and determine if there were any 20 weeks over the course of that entire year when the daily average number of employees was 10 or more (again, six or more for employers with operations in Portland).\n- Is an owner counted for purposes of determining the number of employees?\nSometimes. Generally, if an owner is also getting a W-2, they should be counted as an employee unless some specific exemption applies.\nAn employee is defined as “an individual who renders personal services at a fixed rate to an employer if the employer either pays or agrees to pay for personal services or permits the individual to perform personal services.” ORS 653.601(1)(a).\nA sole proprietor of a business will probably not be an employee, but many businesses are set up as corporations. In those instances it is the corporation, not the individual owners, who are the employers, and the “owners” are employees of the corporation.\nThe following individuals are specifically excluded from the employee count; an individual who is a director of a corporation who has a substantial ownership interest (ownership equal to or greater than the average percentage of ownership of all owners, but not less than 15%), a member of a limited liability company who has a right to vote and a substantial ownership interest, a partner of a limited liability partnership who has a substantial ownership interest, or a sole proprietor of a business. The parent, spouse, or child of such individuals are also excluded from the employee count.\n- Are the owner’s family members counted for purposes of determining the number of employees?\nAn individual employed by that individual’s parent, spouse or child is not an “employee” for the purposes of the sick time law.\nHowever, one should figure out who the employer really is: Is it the parent, spouse, child, or a corporation? Most businesses are set up as separate legal entities that employ the owners and other employees. If this is the case, then the owner’s immediate family would be counted as employees if they work for the business.\nCorporations cannot have children or spouses. The law uses the term “individual,” and until the law changes effective January 1, 2018, a cautious interpretation is that ONLY parents, spouses or children of an individual operating as a sole proprietorship are not counted as employees. They should probably be counted, however, if the employer is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company.\nThe following individuals are specifically excluded from the employee count; an individual who is a director of a corporation who has a substantial ownership interest (ownership equal to or greater than the average percentage of ownership of all owners, but not less than 15%), a member of a limited liability company who has a right to vote and a substantial ownership interest, a partner of a limited liability partnership who has substantial ownership interest, or a sole proprietor of a business. The parent, spouse, or child of such individuals are also excluded from the employee count.\n- How does sick time accrue?\nEmployees accrue one hour of sick time for every 30 hours worked or 1-1/3 hours for every 40 hours worked.\n- When does sick time accrual start?\nSick time accrual begins when an employee starts working for an employer. Although employees immediately start accruing sick time, new employees may be required to wait until their 91st calendar day of employment to use sick time.\n- What if an employee accrues more than 40 hours of sick time over the course of a year?\nIf employees work full-time throughout the course of a year, they will likely have worked enough to accrue almost 70 hours of sick time. Employers are only required to allow employees to use 40 hours in a year, however. The law was amended in 2017 to make clear that an employer may limit the number of paid sick time hours an employee may accrue to 40 hours per year. Employers may also limit carry-over of unused sick time from one year to the next to up to 40 hours a year and cap total accrual balances to 80 hours.\n- What is meant by a \"year\"? How is it measured?\n\"Year\" includes any consecutive 12-month period, such as a calendar year, a tax year, a fiscal year, a contract year, the 12-month period beginning on the anniversary of the date of employment, or any other 12-month period the employer customarily uses.\n- Is “front-loading” sick time or paid time off (PTO) allowed?\nYes. An employer is allowed to “front-load” (give 40 hours of sick time or PTO all at once at the start of the year or when the employee becomes eligible to use sick time) instead of using the accrual method.\n- Is it permissible for an employer to use the front-loading method for full-time employees and the accrual method for part-time employees?\nYes. An employer may award sick time on an accrual basis for certain categories of employees while front-loading sick time hours for other categories of employees, as long as any distinctions the employer makes are consistent and unrelated to the obligation to provide sick time. For example, an employer may award sick time on an accrual basis for part-time or temporary employees, while front-loading sick time for full-time employees, if it customarily maintains different employment conditions for part-time, temporary, and full-time employees.\n- How many hours of sick time must be front-loaded for employees hired mid-year?\nEmployers may front-load a number of hours of sick time that is the pro rata percentage of the hours to which a new employee would be entitled for an entire year based on the number of hours the employee was actually employed by the employer for the year.\nTwenty hours of sick time would be the correct number of sick time to be front-loaded to an employee whose first day of employment is July 1 for an employer that uses a calendar “year.” If an employer is using the front-load method, the hours may not be prorated based on whether an employee is part-time or full-time, but only if they have been newly hired. The prorated amount of front-loaded sick time is the percentage of sick time equal to the percentage of the “year” left at date of hire.\n- I have employees who work only 20 hours per week. Am I able to front-load them with 20 hours?\nNo. Employers who front-load sick time hours must front-load 40 hours at the beginning of the year, unless the employee begins work later in the year.\n- If an employer is using the front-load method, are they required to track accrual rates, carryover entitlements, and usage?\nNo. An employer using the front-load system need only provide a certain number of hours (at least 40) to the employee at the beginning of the year, or a prorated amount if the employee begins work later in the year. Under this method, the employee will not accrue additional sick time unless the employer chooses to provide additional time.\n- For what purposes may an employee use sick time?\nEmployees are entitled to use sick time for the following purposes:\n- To care for the employee or the employee’s family member with a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition, need for medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition, or need for preventive medical care;\n- To care for an infant or newly adopted child under 18 years of age, or for a newly placed foster child under 18 years of age, or for an adopted or foster child older than 18 years of age if the child is incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability, completed within 12 months after birth or placement of the child;\n- To recover from or seek treatment for a health condition of the employee that renders the employee unable to perform at least one of the essential functions of the employee’s regular position;\n- Absences associated with the death of a family member by:\n- Attending the funeral or alternative to a funeral of the family member;\n- Making arrangements necessitated by the death of the family member; or\n- Grieving the death of the family member;\n- Absences related to domestic violence, harassment, sexual assault, bias or stalking\n- To seek legal or law enforcement assistance or remedies to ensure the health and safety of the employee or the employee’s minor child or dependent, including preparing for and participating in protective order proceedings or other civil or criminal legal proceedings related to domestic violence, harassment, sexual assault, bias or stalking;\n- To seek medical treatment for or to recover from injuries caused by domestic violence or sexual assault to or harassment or stalking or the commission of a bias crime against the eligible employee or the employee’s minor child or dependent;\n- To obtain, or to assist a minor child or dependent in obtaining, counseling from a licensed mental health professional related to an experience of domestic violence, harassment, sexual assault bias or stalking;\n- To obtain services from a victim services provider for the eligible employee or the employee’s minor child or dependent; or\n- To relocate or take steps to secure an existing home to ensure the health and safety of the eligible employee or the employee’s minor child or dependent;\n- In the event of a public health emergency, including but not limited to:\n- Closure of the employee’s place of business, or the school or place of care of the employee’s child, by order of a public official due to a public health emergency;\n- A determination by a lawful public health authority or a health care provider that the presence of the employee or the family member of the employee in the community would jeopardize the health of others; or\n- The exclusion of the employee from workplace under any law or rule that requires the employer to exclude the employee from the workplace for health reasons; or\nBOLI recently revised the\nadministrative rule to address specifically the use of sick leave for evacuation, air quality index, and/or heat index orders. The following questions clarify use of sick leave for these purposes.\n- An employee’s home is in a Level 2 or 3 evacuation zone and they have requested to use sick time and not come into work, even though the work location is not in an evacuation zone. Is this permitted?\nProvided they are not employed as a first responder, yes, employees may use available sick leave.\n- An employee has requested to use sick time for a scheduled shift because our work location is subject to a Level 2 or 3 evacuation order. Is this permitted?\nYes, for employees not working as first responders, using sick leave is permissible if either their home or the work location is subject to a Level 2 or 3 evacuation order.\n- An employee has requested to use sick time because they are concerned about the air quality or heat indexes. Is this permitted?\nAs always, if an employee feels sick (including as a result the air quality or heat indexes) the employee may use any available sick leave under the Oregon Sick Leave laws.\nUnder the amended rule, an employee who is not working as a first responder may also use available sick leave when a public official has determined that the air quality or heat indexes at either the employee’s work location or home are at a level where continued exposure to such levels would jeopardize the health of the employee.\n- How will I know if there is a determination by a public official that the air quality or heat indexes are at a level where use of sick leave is permissible?\nThe public official may be a national, state, county or local public official. For determinations related to the heat index, it may come from an emergency order from the Governor of Oregon or other public official or an extreme weather warning from the National Weather Service where individuals are encouraged to avoid outdoor areas for extended periods of time. For determinations related to the air quality index, there may be an emergency order from the Governor of Oregon or other public official or an air quality advisory from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). However, eligible employees would be allowed to use sick time when the air quality index is at 201 or above regardless of whether a public official has made a determination.\nNote: In May, Oregon-OSHA announced permanent rules regarding workplace hazards posed by excessive heat and wildfire smoke. These new rules become effective June 15, 2022 for the heat illness prevention and July 1, 2022 for wildfire smoke. See Oregon OSHA’s website for details on required\nheat illness prevention measures and\nprotections from wildfire smoke.\n- To donate accrued sick time to another employee if the other employee uses the donated sick time for an authorized purpose and the employer has a policy that allows an employee to donate sick time to a coworker.\n- Who qualifies as a covered family member under the sick time law?\nA covered family member means an individual who is related by affinity to the employee or an individual who is the employee’s:\n- Spouse or domestic partner;\n- Child or the child’s spouse or domestic partner;\n- Parent or the parent’s spouse or domestic partner;\n- Sibling or stepsibling or the sibling’s or stepsibling’s spouse or domestic partner;\n- Grandparent or the grandparent’s spouse or domestic partner; or\n- Grandchild or the grandchild’s spouse or domestic partner.\n- Is there a minimum amount of sick time employees would need to take?\nSick time should normally be used by employees in hourly increments unless you permit the use of sick time in increments of less than one hour.\nIf an employee’s use of sick time in hourly increments imposes an undue hardship on the business, you may require employees to use sick time in increments of more than one hour (but not more than four hours). If you do, you must also allow the employee to accrue and use at least 56 hours of sick time per year instead of 40. Additionally, you will need to provide a notice to each employee saying what increments of sick time employees may use. A notice that complies with this requirement is available online\nhere.\nHow much is an employee required to be paid for sick time used?\nEmployees entitled to paid sick time, as discussed above, are required to be paid for sick time taken at their regular rate of pay calculated as follows:\n- Employees paid a single hourly rate of pay: The same hourly rate the employee would have earned for the period of time in which sick time is used if the employee had worked.\n- Employees paid multiple rates of pay:\n- The wages the employee would have been paid, if known, for the period of time in which sick time is used; or\n- The weighted average of all regular rates of pay during the previous pay period.\n- Salaried employees : The employee’s total wages earned during the pay period covered by the salary divided by the number of hours agreed to be worked in the pay period which the salary is intended to compensate. For an employee paid a salary whose hours of work vary from work week to work week, for the purpose of calculating the regular rate of pay to be used for the payment of sick time, the employee is presumed to work 40 hours in each workweek.\n- Employees paid on a commission or piece-rate basis or on the basis of the number of operations accomplished or quantity produced or handled: The employee must be paid no less than the applicable statutory minimum wage.\n- Employees paid an hourly, weekly, or monthly amount in addition to a piece-rate or commission: The rate equivalent to the employee’s hourly, weekly or monthly rate, or the minimum wage, whichever is greater.\nThe regular rate of pay does not include: Overtime, holiday pay, discretionary bonuses or other types of incentive pay, tips, or other premium rates. However, where an employee’s regular rate of pay includes a differential meant to compensate the employee for work performed under differing conditions, such a differential rate is not considered to be a premium rate and must be included.\n- Is an employer required to pay out unused sick time when an employee leaves employment?\nNo, the law is clear; an employer is not required to pay an employee for unused accrued sick time upon termination.\n- What if an employer has an existing sick time or paid time off (“PTO”) policy?\nAn employer is deemed to be in compliance with the law if it has a sick leave policy, paid vacation policy, paid personal time off policy, or other paid time off program that is “substantially equivalent” to or more generous to the employee than the minimum requirements of the sick time law. In order for a plan to be “substantially equivalent,” the policy must provide employees (at a minimum) with the following:\n- The ability to accrue up to 40 hours of leave time at a rate of one hour for every 30 hours worked or 1-1/3 hours for every 40 hours worked or at least 40 hours of front-loaded time at the start of the year that may be used for sick time;\n- Quarterly reports on available leave balances;\n- The ability for new employees to use up to 40 hours of earned time as sick time after their 90th day of employment; and\n- The ability to carry over up to 40 hours of unused accrued time from one year to the next (unless the front-load method of providing sick time is used).\nQualifying absences used under the sick time law may not be the basis for discipline.\n- I own a company that provides 40 hours of PTO to our employees every year on their anniversary date. My employees use their accrued PTO for vacation days, absences due to illness, personal time, doctor appointments, personal appointments, etc. One of our employees used his 40 hours of PTO earlier in the year and he now wants to use eight hours of PTO for an absence on Thursday that he claims was due to illness. He says we owe him 40 hours of sick time because the time he used was for vacation. Do we have to grant paid leave for this absence and other absences during his anniversary year?\nNo. If an employee of an employer with a PTO policy that may be used for paid sick time, paid vacation leave, paid personal time off or other paid time off has exhausted all paid and unpaid leave available to the employee, the employer is not obligated to provide additional leave for paid or unpaid sick time. However, the employer may be obligated to provide paid or unpaid sick time under federal or state law that provides for paid or unpaid leave under state and/or federal family leave laws or other laws not related to the sick time law.\n- My business has a PTO policy that I believe is substantially equivalent to the new sick time law. I provide 40 hours of personal time off each year. Do I have to separately track the reasons for taking PTO based on whether the employee is taking it for vacation, for illness, or for some other reasons?\nNo, not if you only provide 40 hours of PTO. While there is a requirement in the sick time law that requires an employer to track an employee’s PTO to ensure that the employee receives what is required under the law and to provide written notification at least quarterly as to an employee’s accrual and usage, the law only requires that an employer provide up to 40 hours of sick time per year. If you are only providing 40 hours of PTO, and as long as your employee is able to use the time in the PTO bank--up to 40 hours for qualifying absences under the sick time statute--you have met your obligation and it is not necessary to differentiate between various reasons the employee may have used PTO. Essentially, your employee’s PTO bank of 40 hours could have been available for sick time but for the fact that the employee chose to use it for vacation or a combination of other reasons.\n- What if I choose to provide more than 40 hours of PTO to my employees? Do I have to differentiate between time taken for qualifying sick time absences and for other reasons?\nBest practice would be yes, unless you allow an employee to use all of the hours of PTO you provide each year as sick time. Because the sick time law requires that employers provide written notification at least quarterly to employees of their accrued and unused sick time, it would be prudent to track those increments of time that were taken for qualifying reasons under sick time or for other reasons, because otherwise, you would be unable to provide notice to the employee regarding how much time is left to use specifically as sick time.\nFor instance, if an employer provides 80 hours of PTO per year, but only allows an employee to use up to 40 hours of that for reasons related to protected sick time, and an employee used 15 of those hours for sick time, the maximum remaining amount of leave available to the employee for sick time would be 25 hours, but the PTO bank for any other use would be the balance of PTO remaining, or in this case, 65 hours. Because you are required to keep your employee apprised of the amount of sick time accrued and used at least quarterly, you would have to track it separately in order to notify the employee that there are only 25 more hours of PTO to use as sick time this year, even though the total PTO bank is at 65 hours.\nAn employer is only required to track and report the first 40 hours of PTO in a situation described above. Once those first 40 hours have been used, regardless of whether the employee used that time for sick time, there is no further requirement to track the PTO hours. It may still be beneficial to track time used after 40 hours however. Family leave laws (OFLA and FMLA) allow eligible employees to use any accrued paid sick leave, vacation leave or any leave given in lieu of vacation leave (i.e., PTO) during family leave. Employers who have employees with disabilities may also want to track this time for purposes of determining when absences attributable to a disability become an undue hardship.\n- May an employer require medical verification for the use of sick leave?\nYes, but only in these limited circumstances:\n- An employee takes more than three consecutively scheduled workdays of sick time;\n- The need for sick time is foreseeable and is projected to last more than three consecutively scheduled workdays; or\n- An employee commences sick time without providing notice required by the employer's sick time policy (which may not be more than 10 days’ advance notice for foreseeable use of sick time or more notice than is practicable in the event of an unforeseeable use of sick time); or\n- An employer has sufficient evidence to suspect that an employee is abusing sick time, including engaging in a pattern of absenteeism, regardless of whether the employee has used sick time for more than three consecutive days.\nAn employer may not require medical verification in advance of sick time that is expected to last less than three consecutive scheduled workdays.\nNOTE: The employer is required to pay any associated costs for providing medical verification or certification, including lost wages that are not paid under a health benefit plan in which the employee is enrolled. An employer may not require that the verification or certification explain the nature of the illness or details related to domestic violence, sexual assault, harassment, or stalking that necessitates the use of sick time.\n- I have offices in Oregon and Washington. If my employee accrues sick time in Oregon and then transfers to Washington, am I obligated to allow the employee to use the sick time accrued now that they are working in Washington?\nOregon does not have jurisdiction to enforce the sick time law once an employee is no longer employed in Oregon. It is not known how another state’s laws might view an employer’s liability for sick time accrued under this law.\n- How does the sick time law apply to temporary employees?\nTemporary workers hired through a staffing agency are most likely “jointly employed employees” under the law. Joint employers are responsible, both individually and jointly, for ensuring compliance with the provisions of the sick time law and rules. However, in joint employment relationships, the “primary employer” is responsible for providing required notices and sick time to its employees. See OAR 839-007-0005 (1).\nStaffing agencies that place temporary employees with client employers are most often considered to be the primary employer. If a temporary worker has been employed by a staffing agency prior to being placed with a client employer, the employee is entitled to sick time accrued during the employee’s employment with the staffing agency, as well as sick time accrued while employed by the client employer, both as an employee of the staffing agency and as an employee of the client employer, although the client employer is only liable for sick time accrued while the employee was jointly employed by the staffing agency and the client employer. Neither the primary employer nor the client employer may discriminate against an employee for taking sick time.\nIf a client employer hires a temp on a permanent basis, the safest business practice would be to count all of the temp’s time worked for the client employer for sick time purposes. Many staffing agencies are negotiating agreements with their clients to have sick time accrued while employed by the staffing agency carry over to the contract employer.\n- I operate a manufacturing facility and we have a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with our workers. Are we exempt from the sick time law?\nNo. Under\nSB 588 (2021), beginning January 1, 2023, signatory employers may meet their obligations under the sick time law through a multi-employer-employee trust or benefit plan defined by a CBA, but the agreement must also provide a sick leave policy or other paid time off program that is substantially equivalent to or more generous than the minimum requirements of ORS 653.601 to 653.661.\n- If an employee is hired from the Employment Department and meets the other conditions in ORS 653.646 (the employee’s terms and conditions of employment are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and employment-related benefits are provided by a joint multi-employer-employee trust or benefit plan), does the exemption from the sick time law in ORS 653.646 apply?\nNo. Again, in this context, the employees are not “employed through a hiring hall or similar referral system operated by the labor organization or a third party.” The Employment Department is not a hiring hall or similar referral system operated by a labor organization or a third party.\n- Does the work-study exemption only apply to federal work-study students who receive federal financial aid?\nNo. ORS 653.601(1)(c) indicates that participants in work-study programs that provide “students in secondary or post-secondary educational institutions with employment opportunities for financial or vocational training” are not “employees” for purposes of the sick time law. This exception applies to any student employed in a work-study program by a secondary or post-secondary educational institution or to a student in a qualified vocational training program.\n- We provide our employees with 40 hours of PTO each year that may be used for vacation or sick leave. My employee does not want to be paid when he is out sick because he wants to save the time for vacation. Do I have to require the employee to take the day as paid sick time?\nBest practice would be to require the employee to take the day as paid sick time. To do otherwise could lead to problems down the road. But, the law does not mandate that you require employees to take paid sick time. Best practice would be to have the unpaid vacation day discussion once all the employee’s sick time has been used, since vacation time is not protected, instead of risking liability for unpaid sick time an employee is otherwise entitled to use.\n- We use the accrual system for sick time. What happens if an employee takes a day of sick time before any is accrued? Is this protected time? Does the unpaid day count toward the required 40 hours?\nIf a new employee takes sick time before any leave has been accrued or before the 91st day of employment, the sick time is not protected under the sick time law and is subject to the employer's regular attendance policies. Also, since the employee had not accrued any sick time yet, the time off does not count against the employee’s right to earn and use up to 40 hours of protected sick time for that year. Remember, though, even if sick time is not protected under this law, it may be protected under applicable OFLA, FMLA, or ADAA regulations.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Admission consideration for freshmen entering through the Fall 2026 Semester will be based on a holistic review. Holistic admissions at UA includes both academic and non-academic criteria. Academic components considered include high school GPA, performance in core subjects, academic honors and standardized test scores, should a student elect to submit them. Non-academic items include leadership experience, volunteer experience, extracurricular activities, employment and non-academic honors. All students must complete the minimum unit requirements.\nMinimum Unit Requirements\nMost first-time, main-campus freshmen applying for summer or fall admission who meet the December 5 priority deadline can expect an admission decision by late March, if not sooner.\n| Course Category | Number of Units |\n|---|---|\n| English | 4 units. |\n| Social Sciences | 4 units, should include world history or a comparable course. A second world language unit will satisfy one of the four required units. |\n| Mathematics | 3 units (UA recommends algebra I, algebra II, AND 1 unit of either geometry, trigonometry OR calculus). |\n| Natural Sciences | 3 units, should include two courses with lab components. |\n| World Language | 1 unit, if world language is not a graduation requirement or there is not a world language program in your school system, UA will accept courses that reflect an enhanced understanding of global and cultural perspectives. |\n| Other Academic Courses | 5 units, UA recommends courses in fine arts or computer literacy, with additional courses in mathematics, natural sciences and world language. |\nTest Scores\nThe University of Alabama will not require standardized ACT or SAT scores from students applying through the Fall 2026 Semester. The presence of a score will not create an unfair advantage or disadvantage to students applying for admission. If you are unsure whether or not to submit a standardized test score, contact your high school counselor or UA admissions advisor.\nFor students who do not wish to submit a score:\n- If you indicate that you do not want your test scores included in the review of your application for admission, you may still submit test scores for automatic merit scholarship consideration.\nFor students who wish to submit a score:\n- If you choose to self-report your standardized test score, your admission decision is contingent upon the submission of your official test scores prior to enrollment. Students who self-report test scores will need to send official score reports from ACT/SAT as soon as possible after admission.\n- Visit the ACT or College Board (SAT) website to have your test scores sent to UA. Our ACT code is 0052 and our SAT code is 1830.\n- For admission consideration UA will use the highest section score from any test dates of the same exam.\n- For automatic merit scholarship consideration UA will use composite scores only from official score reports.\nScholarships\nThere are two ways students can be eligible for scholarships under UA’s current test optional admission policy.\n- Competitive Scholarships – The competitive scholarship application is part of your application for admission. Students are eligible for competitive scholarship consideration if their application for admission and all supporting documents are received by the competitive scholarship deadline. Includes additional scholarships applied for through the Alabama Scholarship Award Manager (ASAM).\n- Automatic Merit Scholarships – To qualify, students must be admitted and submit all supporting documents including test scores and official transcripts by the automatic merit scholarship deadline. Applicants may indicate that they do not want their test scores included in the review of their application for admission and still submit test scores for automatic merit scholarship consideration.\nFor information on scholarship deadlines and policies, visit afford.ua.edu/scholarships.\nTranscript\nTranscripts may be submitted by mail or through an electronic transcript provider and should be sent to UA directly from your high school. We accept transcripts electronically through the following providers: Parchment/Naviance, E-Scripts, Scribbles, Overgrad, NeedMyTranscript, SCOIR and National Student Clearinghouse. If the school is mailing your transcript(s), please use this address:\nOffice of Undergraduate Admissions\nThe University of Alabama\nBox 870109\nTuscaloosa, AL 35487-0132\nYour transcript(s) may also be emailed to our office at hstranscripts@ua.edu. Please note that emailed transcripts must be in a PDF format and sent directly from the school/counselor to be considered official.\nAcademic Lapse Time\nIf you have had a lapse between graduating from high school and applying for admission as a first-time freshman that lasted six or more months, additional information may be required. You may be asked within your application portal to provide a brief statement listing any academic activities since graduation.\nStatement on Admission\nThe University of Alabama reserves the right to refuse admission or re-enrollment or to place conditions on admission or re-enrollment of applicants and former students who it determines represent a safety risk to University students, employees and University property. Applicants have the right to appeal any such decision to the Undergraduate Admissions Advisory Committee within seven business days of the date the notice was received.\nWithholding information or giving false information may make you ineligible for admission to, or continuation at, the University. Therefore, by submitting this information, you certify that it is true, correct and complete. Also, by submitting this application, you give permission for the University to obtain additional information from others pertinent to your record prior to attending the University.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab,” United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan Southern Division, February 10, 2012, 13-14, https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/291667-abdulmutallab-sentencing-memorandum.html. While in Yemen, Abdulmutallab traveled between mosques, inquiring where he could meet the American-Yemeni cleric. Abdulmutallab eventually came across someone who agreed to pass Abdulmutallab’s contact information on to Awlaki himself.“Government Sentencing Memorandum: United States of America v. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab,” United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan Southern Division, February 10, 2012, 13-14, https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/291667-abdulmutallab-sentencing-memorandum.html.\nAccording to U.S. court documents, Awlaki and Abdulmutallab first spoke by text and then by phone, later agreeing to meet in person. After spending three days in Awlaki’s residence in Yemen and being vetted by Awlaki himself, Abdulmutallab was accepted for a suicide mission and referred to al-Qaeda bomb maker Ibrahim al-Asiri, who designed a chemical bomb specifically for Abdulmutallab. Asiri instructed Abdulmutallab on how to conceal and detonate the bomb, which would involve using a syringe to allow the explosive chemicals to mix.“Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab Sentenced to Life in Prison for Attempted Bombing of Flight 253 on Christmas Day 2009,” U.S. Department of Justice, February 16, 2012, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/umar-farouk-abdulmutallab-sentenced-life-prison-attempted-bombing-flight-253-christmas-day. Awlaki then worked personally with Abdulmutallab to create a five-minute-long “martyrdom video,” to be released following the attack.“Government Sentencing Memorandum: United States of America v. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab,” United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan Southern Division, February 10, 2012, 14, https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/291667-abdulmutallab-sentencing-memorandum.html.\nIn accepting Abdulmutallab for an al-Qaeda suicide bomb mission, Awlaki gave Abdulmutallab flexibility over the details and timing of his attack, with only two stipulations: the attack had to be on a U.S. airliner and detonated over U.S. soil.“Government Sentencing Memorandum: United States of America v. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab,” United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan Southern Division, February 10, 2012, 14, https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/291667-abdulmutallab-sentencing-memorandum.html.

Twenty minutes before landing in Detroit, Michigan, Abdulmutallab attempted to explode the suicide bomb strapped to his underwear. Rather than explode, the bomb lit on fire, causing severe burns to Abdulmutallab’s leg. Abdulmutallab was subdued by a nearby passenger and arrested upon his arrival in Detroit.Scott Shane and Eric Lipton, “Passengers’ Quick Action Halted Attack,” New York Times, December 26, 2009, http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/us/27plane.html.\nOn October 12, 2011, Abdulmutallab pled guilty to all charges leveled against him, saying that he “attempted to use an explosive device which in the U.S. law is a weapon of mass destruction,” but which he considered a “blessed weapon.”Monica Davey, “Would-Be Plane Bomber Pleads Guilty, Ending Trial,” New York Times, October 12, 2011, http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/us/umar-farouk-abdulmutallab-pleads-guilty-in-plane-bomb-attempt.html.

In his opening statement at the military tribunal in Fort Hood, Hasan declared himself the shooter and said that he was a member of the “mujhadeen [holy warriors].”Jennifer Hlad, “In opening remarks, Hasan says he was ‘on the wrong side’ in US Army uniform,” Stars and Stripes, August 6, 2013, https://archive.org/stream/final-report-of-the-william-h.-webster-commission#page/n0/mode/2up.

Roughly one year after the shooting, Awlaki praised Hasan, stating, “How can we object to...Nidal Hasan’s operation. He killed American soldiers who were on their way to Afghanistan and Iraq. Who would object to that?”Jeremy Havardi, “The children of Anwar Al-Awlaki,” Commentator, May 23, 2013, www.thecommentator.com/article/3605/the_children_of_anwar_al_awlaki.\nStatements by Hasan’s acquaintances following the attack reveal that Hasan viewed his military service as deeply in conflict with his religion. According to Duane Reasoner Jr., a friend of Hasan’s who attended mosque, “[Hasan] felt he was supposed to quit [the army]… In the Koran, it says you are not supposed to have alliances with Jews or Christians, and if you are killed in the military fighting against Muslims, you will go to hell.” Reasoner characterized Hasan as “very upset” and stated, “He didn’t want to go to Afghanistan.” In 2004, Hasan reportedly sought legal advice in an effort to terminate his Army contract, which was set to last until 2010. On one occasion in 2009, Hasan asked Osman Danquah—a veteran of the first Gulf War and the cofounder of Killeen mosque which Hasan attended—how he should counsel Muslim soldiers objecting to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Danquah later told the media, “I got the impression he was trying to validate how he was dealing with it.”James C.

In August 2013, the military court found Hasan guilty on all charges and sentenced him to death.Manny Fernandez, “Death Penalty for Rampage at Fort Hood,” New York Times, August 28, 2013, www.nytimes.com/2013/08/29/us/jury-weighs-sentence-for-fort-hood-shooting.html?_r=0.

Because Hasan received a death sentence, his case qualified for an automatic appeal. However, the commanding general of Fort Hood also had to approve the findings and the sentence before the case could move to the appeal process.“Hasan Faces Lengthy Appeals Process Before Execution,” KUT News, August 29, 2013, https://www.kut.org/texas/2013-08-29/hasan-faces-lengthy-appeals-process-before-execution.\nThe appeals process progressed slowly. On December 11, 2020, the Army Court of Criminal Appeals upheld Hasan’s conviction. The court rejected an argument by Hasan’s attorney that the trial should have been moved to a different venue because of prejudicial pretrial publicity. The court also rejected a challenge to the impartiality of the jury based on a juror who had a bumper sticker that read “Major League Infidel.”“Capital Case Roundup — Death Penalty Court Decisions the Week of December 7, 2020,” Death Penalty Information Center, December 11, 2020, https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/capital-case-roundup-death-penalty-court-decisions-the-week-of-december-7-2020. On March 28, 2023, Hasan’s defense filed an argument with the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. The court initially issued a decision upholding the conviction in September 2023. However, the defense immediately submitted a request for reconsideration. On March 4, 2024, the court reissued its decision to uphold Hasan’s conviction.UNITED STATES Appellee v. Nidal M.

A February 21, 2025, response by the U.S. Department of Justice argued that Hasan’s court-martial conviction on 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 specifications of attempted premeditated murder had been appropriate. The Department of Justice further noted that the conviction had been affirmed through subsequent appeals in the Army Court of Criminal Appeals and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. On March 31, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Hasan’s appeal.Emily Hilley-Sierzchula, “U.S. Supreme Court denies petition filed by Nidal Hasan, infamous Fort Hood mass murderer,” KDH News, April 7, 2025, https://kdhnews.com/military/u-s-supreme-court-denies-petition-filed-by-nidal-hasan-infamous-fort-hood-mass-murderer/article_7913088b-71d9-4d52-bc66-381d49240ea4.html.\nBarring another appeal, Hasan will face the death penalty upon approval by the White House. At the end of September 2025, U.S. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth issued a statement calling for the death penalty for Hasan. Hegseth said that he was “100 percent committed to ensuring the death penalty is carried out for Nidal Hasan.

One month later, Shahzad returned to Pakistan. In December 2009, he began training with TTP militants in Waziristan, Pakistan. Shahzad lived and trained alongside TTP militants for approximately two months, five days of which he spent learning to build explosives.Adams, Lorraine and Ayesha Nasir, “Inside the mind of the Times Square bomber,” Guardian (London), September 18, 2010, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/19/times-square-bomber.\nShahzad returned to the United States in February of 2010 after living and training with the TTP for two months. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, between February and April of 2010, Shahzad received two separate payments totaling $12,000 from the TTP via the informal hawala system. Hawala—an ancient payment system with Middle Eastern and South Asian roots—allows people to transfer money across the world by way of brokers, or hawaladar, who collect and pay money out of their own funds before balancing their accounts with one another. Shahzad used the $12,000 to purchase materials for the attack, including bomb materials and a car.“Faisal Shahzad Sentenced in Manhattan Federal Court to Life in Prison for Attempted Car Bombing in Times Square,” United States Attorney Southern District of New York, October 5, 2010, 1-2; West, Ben and Scott Stewart, “Uncomfortable Truths and the Times Square Attack,” Stratfor, May 6, 2010, https://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20100505_uncomfortable_truths_times_square_attack;\nBenjamin Weiser, “Charges of Getting Cash to Failed Times Sq.

Shahzad parked in Times Square near 45th Street and Seventh Avenue, and walked a few blocks away to wait for the explosion. However, Shahzad had mistakenly set the timer—which ran on military time—to 07:00 rather than 19:00. When no explosion occurred, Shahzad returned to his home in Connecticut.Adams, Lorraine and Ayesha Nasir, “Inside the mind of the Times Square bomber,” Guardian (London), September 18, 2010, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/19/times-square-bomber.

Shahzad was further featured in a TTP propaganda video released in July 2010. The video was filmed at some point between late 2009 and early 2010 while Shahzad lived alongside the TPP in Pakistan. In the video, Shahzad urged Muslims to “fight against the enemy of Islam,” and to carry out attacks on the United States. The video also featured clips of Western media coverage of the Times Square attack.“United States v.

Their motive was “absolutely clear,” said Morell, who added that the brothers were “trying to shut down a media organization that lampooned the Prophet Muhammad.”Dan Bilefsky and Maïa de la Baume, “Terrorists Strike Charlie Hebdo Newspaper, Leaving 12 Dead,” New York Times, January 7, 2015, http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-paris-shooting.html?_r=1.\nThe Kouachi brothers, of Algerian descent, grew up in France. Their father died during the brothers’ early teenage years. Their mother sent them to a state school for special-needs children because she was unable to care for them. The Kouachis’ mother died before they completed school and they did not proceed to university. The brothers moved to Paris’s 19th arrondisement, a neighborhood known for its large and poor immigrant population.Scott Bronstein, “Cherif and Said Kouachi: Their path to terror,” CNN, January 14, 2015, http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/13/world/kouachi-brothers-radicalization/index.html.\nChérif was known to French authorities one decade before the Charlie Hebdo massacre. In the 19th arrondisement, the brothers attended Adda’wa mosque, a.k.a. La Mosquee de Stalingrad, with French Islamist cleric Farid Benyettou. Chérif would later tell a French court that Benyettou first introduced him to the concept of jihad and encouraged him to go fight in Iraq.

In the early morning hours of June 12, 2016, Mateen gunned down 49 people and injured 53 more at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. He reportedly pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Facebook—as well as in a call to 911—during the attack.

While firing his weapons, Mateen reportedly yelled “Allahu Akhbar,” and said that “America needs to stop bombing ISIS in Syria.” Witnesses also heard him say “stop bombing my country,” presumably in reference to his parents’ native Afghanistan. He engaged in a brief firefight with an off-duty officer, but survived the shootout and took approximately 30 people hostage in the bathroom of the club. During calls with the police, Mateen reportedly threatened to strap explosives to four of the hostages and place them throughout the club. He also reportedly said he would spare African American hostages, announcing, “I don’t have a problem with black people…This is about my country. You guys suffered enough.” At 5 a.m., a SWAT team stormed the premises and, according to authorities, detonated a “distractionary device” in order to confuse Mateen. The officers reportedly broke through a wall of the nightclub in order to free hostages, after which they shot and killed Mateen. “Orlando Shooting: What We Know and Don’t Know,” New York Times, June 12, 2016, http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/06/13/us/orlando-shooting-what-we-know-and-dont-know.html?referer=; Kate Lions, “Orlando Pulse club attack: gunman identified as police investigate motive,” Guardian (London), June 12, 2016, http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/12/orlando-shooting-nightclub-pulse-gunman.\nMateen worked as a security guard and lived in Port St. Lucie, Florida.

On April 8, 2015, he was found guilty on all 30 charges including causing death by use of a weapon of mass destruction. The following month, he was sentenced to death by lethal injection. The day after his conviction, he was transferred to a maximum-security prison near Florence, Colorado.

Al-Awlaki—the former director of external operations for al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)—was assassinated in a U.S. drone strike on the orders of President Obama in 2011. Tsarnaev exhorted friends via Twitter to listen to al-Awlaki’s sermons. Tsarnaev downloaded al-Awlaki-authored and -inspired materials, including a copy of a book entitled “The Slicing Sword Against The One Who Forms Allegiances With The Disbelievers And Takes Them As Supporters Instead Of Allah, His Messenger And The Believers,” which contains a foreword by al-Awlaki. He also downloaded Volume One of AQAP’s magazine Inspire, which contains instructions on how to construct a bomb.

In the suit, Tsarnaev complained that he had been limited to three showers a week. He also claimed prison guards had confiscated a baseball hat and bandana he purchased in the prison commissary because they thought he was disrespecting the FBI and victims of the Boston Marathon bombing by wearing them.

Despite the ruling, the Justice Department’s moratorium on federal executions is likely to further delay the execution.\nOn January 10, 2023, Tsarnaev’s attorneys filed an appeal with the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston to have Tsarnaev’s death sentence thrown out because of juror misconduct. They argued two jurors lied during jury selection. According to the attorneys, one juror lied during selection about not having publicly commented on the case, while another had contact with Tsarnaev’s Facebook friends. One of those friends reportedly urged the juror to “play the part” so he could get on the jury and send Tsarnaev to “jail where he will be taken of.”Alanna Durkin Richer, “Court weighs tossing Boston marathon bomber’s death sentence,” Associated Press, January 10, 2023, https://apnews.com/article/massachusetts-state-government-legal-proceedings-crime-boston-f32276fbfccb77fca2a08ae831d7f4df.

Boston Globe reporter David Filipov also gives his perspective. Filipov wrote a December 2013 article on the Tsarnaevs that revealed Tamerlan claimed from an early age he heard a voice in his head that told him to commit various acts.

When presidential assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was killed in the tumultuous days following the murder of John F. Kennedy it was difficult to find a pastor willing to conduct a funeral. A North Carolina native stepped up in a story I first heard in the 1990s. I recounted it in 2013 when the Boston Marathon bomber was laid to rest.\nSo I figured I would recount it here again.\n———-\nThere are a lot of reasons to remember the Rev. Louis Saunders, a native of a small Eastern North Carolina town most couldn’t find on the map without a magnifying glass.\nForget that he studied theology at Duke University or received a divinity degree at Vanderbilt or completed chaplain’s school at Harvard.\nAnd don’t even stop to consider that he joined World War II after Pearl Harbor, survived the Allied invasion of Normandy then wound up in the Pacific Theater. And then he up and remained in the Philippines after the war as a missionary and built the first high school in a remote province there.\nYes, all of that stuff is particularly noteworthy, but in this case, not really.\nBecause the Rev. Louis Saunders, a native of a town called Richlands who passed away at age 88 in 1998, was a key figure in one really big historic event. Most probably never heard of him.\nHe’s the man who buried Lee Harvey Oswald.\nLEARNING ABOUT often astonishing tales is at least part of why the newspaper business is so addictive.\nThis Louis Saunders thing is like that.\nI found out about him for the first time about 18 or so years ago when I worked for the Jacksonville Daily News. One of our reporters covered graduation night at Richlands High School. For those who don’t know, Richlands (pronounced like two distinct words rich lands), is a town steeped in a farming tradition and named for the quality soil found there. Up until a few years ago, travelers were greeted at the town limits by a sign that also hailed it as “The Town of Perfect Water.” Later testing proved this not to be exactly true, so Richlands leaders saw fit to take down this misleading piece of municipal advertising.\nAnyway, our reporter came back that night talking about the graduation speaker, an alumnus who was the presiding pastor at the funeral for Lee Harvey Oswald, the man who killed President John F. Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963 — if you believe the Warren Commission Report.\n“You’re kidding,” I said.\n“Nope,” came the reply.\nIn November of 1963, Saunders was executive director for the 20-church Fort Worth (Texas) Council of Churches and watching events unfold on TV like everyone else. He heard on the Monday after Kennedy’s assassination that Oswald — himself gunned down on live TV while in police custody — would be buried in Fort Worth.\n“I felt some responsibility for the religious community,” he told Daily News reporter C. Mark Brinkley in 1997, just a few months before passing away.\nThat’s how Saunders came to take ownership of what became a job no one wanted — saying a few words at the gravesite of the most hated man in America.\nAfter contacting the funeral home about arrangements, Saunders said he was assured that a member of the local clergy would be there to conduct the service. But he wanted to make sure everything happened as planned so he attended the service at Rose Hill Cemetery.\nAnd of course, it didn’t. The pastors who agreed to officiate did not show up. Saunders had been afraid something like that might happen and tried to line up volunteers just in case.\nHe got no takers.\n”I got more and more anxious,” Saunders said in 1997. “I think there were hundreds of photographers — all lined up, maybe three rows deep.”\nThat’s when he was approached by Oswald’s mother, Marguerite, and asked to perform the service, the New York Times reported.\nHe couldn’t turn down a mother, even the mother of America’s biggest villain. And it was the Christian thing to do.\n”It’s easy to say something that can be misinterpreted,” Saunders said. “I didn’t want to do that.”\nAccording to the New York Times, he read the 23rd Psalm and then offered one of the shortest eulogies ever.\n“Mrs. Oswald tells me that her son, Lee Harvey, was a good boy and that she loved him. And today, Lord, we commit his spirit to your Divine care.”\nTHEY BURIED Tamerlan Tsarnaev on Thursday. It was at an undisclosed location. No media were there to document the funeral of one of the suspected Boston Marathon bombers, arguably America’s newest edition of most hated villains.\nAnd it happened after a massive game of keep-away. No one wanted to bury Tamerlan Tsarnaev in their town. In all, officials in Massachusetts received 120 offers of graves from the U.S. and Canada. None worked out. Even a site at a state prison was rescinded.\nPeople didn’t want the notoriety in their back yard.\n“It’s not only Massachusetts that doesn’t want him,” a Worcester, Mass. funeral home director said. “Nobody wants him. And all these people who have donated graves, I’ve made some calls and said to somebody in the cities and towns where the graves were, ‘Hey, we would like to bury the guy there that was part of the marathon bombing.’”\nThe response? “You’re not gonna do that here.”\nThe problem prompted Worcester police Chief Gary Gemme to say, “We are not barbarians. We bury the dead.”\nThat’s when I thought of the Rev. Louis Saunders, who took on an unenviable and perhaps distasteful task in November 1963 because it was the Christian thing to do and the right thing to do.\nHe would’ve understood.\nPingback: Throwback Thursday: Ric Flair used to date a girl from Richlands | Madison's Avenue\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, Cincinnati! It is good to be back! Everybody, please have a seat if you've got a seat. (Laughter.) I think most people have a seat here. It is great to see all of you.\nI want to acknowledge -- first of all, I want to make sure that I acknowledge your outstanding mayor, Mark Mallory is in the house! (Applause.) Where is he? He was around here somewhere. There he is right there. Good to see you.\nNow, I know that some of you think that I came to this music hall to sing. (Laughter and applause.) But I have to tell you, there's no concert tonight -- (laughter) -- or at least not this afternoon. There may be a concert tonight. Michelle has told me I should not be singing in public all the time. (Laughter.) Well, it's -- happy birthday. What's your name?\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Adam.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Adam? How old are you, Adam?\nAUDIENCE: I'm 18 today.\nTHE PRESIDENT: All right. Let's sing \"Happy Birthday\" to Adam then. We can sing. (Sings \"Happy Birthday\"). Yay! All right. (Applause.) So there was a concert after all. (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm 101 years old!\nTHE PRESIDENT: There you go. Let's give a round of applause -- what's your name, sir?\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Dr. Harvey.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Okay. (Laughter.) Dr. Harvey, happy -- it's not your birthday, but just congratulations on being 101. (Applause.) Dr. Harvey looks good. I've got to follow him around and see what he eats. (Laughter.) Because I'm going to eat what he eats.\nOkay, you guys -- 105 right here! (Applause.) 105? (Laughter.) What's that sweet lady's name?\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Margaret Harris.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Margaret Harris is 105 years old. (Applause.) God bless her -- 106 next month. She's beautiful.\nWell, it's so nice to -- I guess folks do pretty good down here in Cincinnati. (Laughter.) You've got 105, 101 --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm 93.\nTHE PRESIDENT: -- 93 -- okay. (Laughter.) God bless you. We love you, too. (Laughter.) Anybody else over 100? (Laughter.) You're not over 100. All right. No more birthdays, that’s it. (Laughter.)\nNow, today --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Are you going to sing?\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I'm not going to sing. (Laughter.) No Al Green.\nToday, we are turning this beautiful music hall into a town hall. (Applause.) So I'm not going to take too much time up front. I want to spend as much time as possible answering some of your questions and getting your comments. But I do want to just say a few things about what's at stake here.\nFour years ago, we came together -- Democrats, but also independents and Republicans -- who were interested in restoring the basic bargain that made America the greatest nation on Earth. We've got so much to be thankful for -- incredible land and an incredible military, our men and women in uniform, they do so much for us all the time, and there's obviously great wealth in this nation. But what really sets us apart has always been that we've got the greatest middle class -- (applause) -- and a basic idea that’s at the heart of this country that says if you work hard, then you can get ahead. If you're responsible, then you can live out your dreams, you're not confined to the circumstances of your birth.\nA basic belief that if you're doing what you need to do -- because we're not a country that believes in handouts, we believe in working for what we get -- that you're able to find a job that supports a family, get a home that you can call your own, that you're able to send your kids to get a good education and hopefully allow them to go to college and they can achieve and succeed in ways you might not have even imagined; that you won't go bankrupt when you get sick -- (applause) -- that you'll be able to retire with dignity and respect. (Applause.) That’s the idea that built this country. That’s the idea that turned us into a economic powerhouse.\nAnd what we saw for about a decade before I took office was the sense that that dream was slipping away from too many people, because people were working harder but they were getting less. Incomes and wages were flat-lining while the cost of everything from college to health care to groceries to gas were all going up.\nSo our goal was to turn this around -- and we knew it wouldn’t be easy. We knew that it might take more than one term, maybe more than one President. But we knew that we had to get started to reclaim this dream.\nAnd then what we discovered was that because of irresponsibility, because of economic policies that had failed and a lack of oversight when it came to regulations, we inherited the worst financial crisis and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And millions of people were hurt -- lost their jobs, lost their homes, lost their savings. And a lot of folks are still struggling.\nBut here's the thing. Americans are always tougher than tough times. And this crisis has not changed our character. It hasn't changed what we believe in. It hasn't changed that basic notion that everybody should get a fair shot, and everybody should do their fair share, and everybody should play by the same set of rules. (Applause.)\nAnd so even though over the last three and a half years, our central focus has been how do we recover from this crisis, and get people back to work, and make sure that small businesses are doing well again, and that they're getting financing -- despite all those things, our goal has not just been to get back to where we were before the crisis struck, but rather to build an economy that lasts -- (applause) -- to build an economy that says no matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, no matter what your last name is, you can make it if you try here in America. (Applause.)\nEverything I’ve done since I’ve been President has been focused on this central issue. That's the reason I’m running for a second term as President of the United States. (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: And you know, part of the reason -- part of the reason I’m here today --\nAUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years!\nTHE PRESIDENT: -- part of the reason that I’m here today is I want to remind everybody that the challenges we face are solvable. The problem is not a lack of big ideas. It’s not a lack of technical solutions to our policy issues. The problem is we’ve got a stalemate right now in Washington --\nAUDIENCE: Yes!\nTHE PRESIDENT: -- between two fundamentally different ideas about how we move the country forward.\nThis election is about more than just two candidates or two political parties. It’s about two different visions about how do we build a strong economy. (Applause.) And the good news is you’re the tiebreaker. The choice is up to you. The choice is up to you. (Applause.)\nGovernor Romney and his allies in Congress, they believe in an economic theory that says if folks at the very top are doing really well, then that spreads to everybody else. It’s what we call top-down economics.\nSo right now their main prescription for growing the economy faster is an additional $5 trillion in tax cuts, most of which would go to the wealthiest Americans, even if to pay for it you’d have to gut education programs, or turn Medicare into a voucher program, or eliminate our investments in basic research and science. That's their vision about how you grow an economy.\nThey’ve actually got a two-part vision. One is tax cuts for the wealthy, and then the second is eliminate regulations that we’ve put in place to make sure, for example, that Wall Street doesn't engage in the same reckless behavior that got us into this mess in the first place. (Applause.)\nNow, I’ve got to tell you, it would be one thing if they had this theory and we hadn’t tried it before. But the truth is we tried it for almost a decade, and it didn’t work. The track record of their vision resulted in turning surpluses into deficits. We ran two wars on a credit card. Job growth was the most sluggish it had been in decades. The average wages and income of working families actually went down during this period, and it culminated in this massive crisis.\nSo I don’t know about you, but in my life, what I found -- sometimes I do bone-headed things, I make mistakes. What I find is when I don’t -- when I try something and it doesn’t work, then I don’t try it again. (Applause.) Right? You don’t go back to doing something that didn’t work.\nNow, I’ve got a different idea. So, for example, Governor Romney said he would extend the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans indefinitely.\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\nTHE PRESIDENT: He says that until he puts a tax plan in place. But his tax plan is not just to keep all the Bush tax cuts. As I said, he wants to put another $5 trillion -- this is estimated that it’s almost impossible for you to bring down the deficit and deal with the debt with that kind of tax plan. Nearly 40 percent of these new taxes would go to the top 1 percent of all households.\nWe have not found any serious economic study that says Governor Romney’s economic plan would actually create jobs -- until today. I’ve got to be honest. Today we found out there’s a new study out by non-partisan economists that says Governor Romney’s economic plan would, in fact, create 800,000 jobs. There’s only one problem: The jobs wouldn’t be in America. (Laughter and applause.) They would not be in America. They’d be in other countries. By eliminating taxes on corporations’ foreign income, Governor Romney’s plan would actually encourage companies to shift more of their operations to foreign tax havens, creating 800,000 jobs in those other countries.\nNow, this shouldn’t be a surprise, because Governor Romney’s experience has been investing in what were called \"pioneers\" of the business of outsourcing. Now he wants to give more tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.\nSo I want everybody to understand, Ohio, I’ve got a different theory. We don’t need a President who plans to ship more jobs overseas, or wants to give more tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to give tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in Ohio -- (applause) -- that are investing in Cincinnati, that are investing in Hamilton County. (Applause.) I want to give incentives to companies that are investing in you, the American people, to create American jobs, making American goods that we’re selling around the world, stamped with three proud words: Made in America. (Applause.)\nThat’s why I’m running for President of the United States.\nNow, the difference extends not just to the difference in corporate taxes, it's also individual taxes. We don't need a President who is going to give himself a big tax break. (Laughter.) We need a President who is going to cut your taxes.\nNow, four years ago I promised to cut taxes for the middle class -- and I kept that promise.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, you did! (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: The typical family's tax burden is $3,600 lower than it was when I came into office. I want all the press to notice that. (Applause.) Because sometimes, you'll hear all these crazy accusations -- oh, Obama, is raising taxes and burdening -- no, here are the facts. Typical middle-class family, your taxes have gone down $3,600 since I've been in office. (Applause.)\nA couple weeks ago, I called on Congress to immediately extend these tax cuts to 98 percent of the American people. Folks making $250,000 a year or less would not see their taxes go up one single dime -- their income taxes go up one single dime. (Applause.) Now, I should point out, by the way, that 97 percent of small businesses also would not see their taxes go up, because typically they don't earn more than $250,000. (Applause.)\nNow, if you're fortunate enough to be the other 2 percent -- and I am -- I mean, Michelle and I didn't use to be, now we are. We've been blessed. That's great. (Applause.) What we're saying is for those folks, we can afford to pay a little bit more in taxes by going back to the rates that were paid under Bill Clinton. That will help us reduce our deficit by about a trillion dollars. And everybody says the deficit and the debt are important, and I agree. (Applause.)\nAnd I just want to point out, the last time we did that, when Bill Clinton was President, we had surpluses, not deficits, created 23 million new jobs, and by the way, we created a lot of millionaires and billionaires to boot. Because when an economy is growing from the middle out and from the bottom up, everybody does well, including people at the very top. That's how you grow an economy. (Applause.)\nWhen teachers and firefighters and police officers and construction workers -- when folks who are putting in a hard day's work, when they do well, then everybody does well. That's how America has always succeeded. We believe in individual initiative and self-reliance. But there's some things we do together, and growing an economy is one of them.\nMy grandfather, he went to college on the GI Bill. That generation helped to expand the middle class, and everybody did better. When we invested in the Hoover Dam or the Golden Gate Bridge, or the Internet, sending a man to the moon -- all those things benefited everybody. And so that's the vision that I want to carry forward.\nThat's why when the auto industry was on the brink of collapse and Governor Romney said let's \"let Detroit go bankrupt,\" I said no. One out of eight jobs in Ohio depend on the auto industry -- (applause) -- a million jobs across the Midwest are at stake. (Applause.) I'm going to bet on American workers and American ingenuity. And now, GM is back on top and Chrysler and Ford are on the move, and the American auto industry has come roaring back. (Applause.)\nSo let me just close by saying this, and then we can get to some questions. My vision says we’re going to invest in education and we’re going to hire new teachers, especially in math and science; open up 2 million more slots for folks to go to community colleges to get trained in the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now. (Applause.) We already helped to make sure that student loan rates didn't double, but now we’ve got to work more to lower tuition costs so young people aren’t burdened with debt. (Applause.)\nSo we’re going to invest in education. We’re going to invest in American energy. Yes, we want to continue to expand our production of oil and natural gas, but I also want to make sure that we are the leaders in solar and wind and biodiesel, the energy of the future that can help reduce our dependence on foreign oil. (Applause.)\nAmerican manufacturing, change our tax code, provide incentives for companies to invest here, invest in basic research and science so that we are at the cutting-edge -- because whoever has got the best technology, will ultimately have the best economy. (Applause.) We've got to make those investments.\nRebuilding our infrastructure -- I know you've got some bridges around here that need repair. (Applause.) You've got some roads that need a repair. Let's put construction workers back to work. (Applause.)\nI ended the war in Iraq as I promised. We're winding down the war in Afghanistan. We decimated al Qaeda. (Applause.) Let's now take half the money we were spending on war and do some nation-building right here at home. (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\nTHE PRESIDENT: And finally, let's reduce our deficit, reduce our debt. Let's do it in a responsible way that allows us to continue to make these investments we need to grow, and make sure that everybody is doing a little bit to help not just themselves but help the country.\nSo that’s my vision. And it contrasts with the other side, and you are going to be the tiebreaker. This is going to be your choice. That’s how our democracy works. And some of you noticed, there's going to be a lot of paid advertising and a lot of money -- we're seeing folks write $10 million checks --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: That's not us!\nTHE PRESIDENT: -- to try to get me out of office. So it's not you, I know. (Laughter.)\nBut even though my hair is a little grayer -- (laughter) -- even though I'm a little older, let me tell you, I still have as much confidence as I ever had in the American people. (Applause.) Because one of the great privileges of being President is you get a chance to travel all across the country. You meet people from every walk of life. And wherever I go, what I'm always struck by is the core decency and goodness and hard work and responsibility and faith that the American people have.\nSo I'll always bet on the American people. And I'm confident that if we work hard, we get our message out, we have an honest debate about what needs to happen in this country and what future is best for our children and our grandchildren, then we're going to finish what we started in 2008. (Applause.) And we'll remind the world why the United States is the greatest nation on Earth. (Applause.)\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you. (Applause.)\nOkay. So everybody take a seat so I can see who wants to ask a question. And there are no -- there are only a couple of rules here. Rule number one is you’ve got to raise your hand if you have a question. I’m going to call girl-boy, girl-boy -- (laughter) -- just to make sure that it’s fair. If you have a chance, stand up and introduce yourself. And there are folks in the audience with microphones, so wait until we’ve got a microphone so everybody can hear your question.\nAnd my only other request, because I want to try to get in as many questions as I can -- at least six or seven -- so if people can keep their questions short, I’ll try to keep my answers short. (Laughter.) But, now, if you ask me how do you bring about world peace, that’s a big question. (Laughter.) So try to keep the question to one that we can be succinct about, all right?\nAnd I’m going to start with this young lady right here in the sort of the pink, white blouse. Yes, right there. All right, and wait till the microphone comes up. Introduce yourself.\nQ Can you stand with me?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Oh, is that the birthday boy?\nQ Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Okay, I didn’t -- he’s getting a lot of attention today. (Laughter.) All right, go ahead.\nQ Okay. My name is Anna, and my son is openly gay. And he is grassroots, and he speaks for a lot of the LGBT community. And we’d like to know, since you are for the LGBT, what’s your next steps? What are you going to do for us? (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, let me say this. First of all, I think what the American people have seen and made such progress on is recognizing the idea of equal rights, equal dignity, equal respect for everybody. That applies to everybody. (Applause.) That is a bedrock principle of America.\nAnd that’s -- when I came into office, everything from making sure that same-sex couples could have visitation in hospitals just like everybody else, making sure that we ended \"don’t ask, don’t tell\" because fighting for the country you love should not depend on who you love -- (applause) -- being clear that DOMA is something that we should repeal -- across the board I’ve tried to constantly align myself with what is best in our tradition, and that is you treat everybody fairly.\nAmericans are about fairness. And that doesn’t mean that folks have to agree with everybody on everything. We don’t. But we want to treat everybody fairly.\nNow, I think it’s important to recognize, though, that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters are still subject to discrimination. That’s why we passed hate-crime legislation, and we’ve still got to fight for that. I think it is important for us to respect decisions that states make with respect to expanding treatment of same-sex couples and marriage. But also what I want to say is that gay and lesbian families are like everybody else -- what they’re really also worried about right now is making sure they can pay the bills. (Applause.)\nSo my strong belief is that it is important for us to focus on individual issues of fairness, but also recognize that we all have common interests as well. Your son is 18; I’m assuming he’s going to get some more education, and I’m assuming you guys are worrying right now about making sure he doesn’t come out with a whole bunch of debt, and how --\nQ Miami.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Miami?\nQ Miami.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Miami of Ohio?\nQ Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Outstanding -- congratulations. (Applause.) We’ve got some folks from the alma mater here.\nSo we want to treat everybody fairly, and we also want to make sure that the economy treats everybody fairly. And I’m going to be fighting for that as long as I’m President of the United States. (Applause.)\nAll right. This gentleman right here. Does anybody have a mic over there? Okay, right behind -- very good. I’m impressed. There you go.\nQ Mr. President, I’m Jim O’Reilly. Ten years as an elected city official has shown me a real change in what the Republican Party has been doing to us. They’ve taken away our power to protect our natural resources -- water and air -- from the strength of the oil and gas drillers that are doing fracking here in Ohio. I support what Lisa Jackson and the EPA are doing. Is there more the administration can do to protect us from the adverse effects of drilling for natural gas? Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, this is a great question, and it’s an important question. (Applause.) A couple of things I just want everybody to know. First of all, if you hear anybody say that somehow we are impeding the development of our energy resources here in this nation, I want you to know these facts: oil production -- higher than it’s been in eight years; natural gas production -- higher than it’s been probably in our lifetimes; oil imports -- actually lower than they’ve been in 16 years. In fact, our oil imports are less than 50 percent now for the first time in a very long time. And so we’re moving in the right direction in terms of energy independence. (Applause.)\nNow, part of that is this boom in natural gas. And this is something we should welcome, because not only are we blessed with incredible natural gas resources that are now accessible because of new technologies, but natural gas actually burns cleaner than some other fossil fuels, and is an ideal fuel -- energy source that we potentially can use for the next 100 years. So I want to encourage natural gas production. The key is to make sure that we do it safely and in a way that is environmentally sound.\nNow, you always hear these arguments that somehow there’s this huge contradiction between the environment and economic development, or the environment and energy production. And the fact of the matter is that there are a lot of folks right now that are engaging in hydraulic fracking who are doing it safely. The problem is, is that we haven’t established clear guidelines for how to do it safely, and informed the public so that neighbors know what’s going on, and your family, you can make sure that any industry that’s operating in your area, that they’re being responsible.\nSo what we’ve said is, look, we are going to work with industry to establish best practices. We are going to invest in the basic research and science required to make sure this is done safely and in a way that protects the public health. And for responsible companies, they should be able to operate, make a profit, and we can all benefit and put people back to work. But if you’re an irresponsible company that’s not doing the right thing, we’re going to hold you to account. And that’s how we should develop this incredible resource -- which, by the way, if we do it properly, could end up changing the economics and politics globally of energy in a way that's actually very good for us, because we'll be less dependent on what happens in the Middle East and our economy will be less subject to the kinds of spikes that we saw earlier in the spring in terms of gas prices.\nThank you for the question. (Applause.)\nAll right, it's a woman's turn. That young lady in the white t-shirt right there -- hold on, hold on, wait for the mic.\nQ My name is Delisha White (ph) and I and my husband, we're small business owners. And he actually has a question that he needs to answer. (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, wait. No, no, you can't do that now. (Laughter.) I called on the young lady and that's what's called a bait and switch. (Laughter.) That is what's called a bait and switch. No, the rule is that I'm going to make sure that women get equal time with men. (Applause.)\nQ Well, we would like --\nTHE PRESIDENT: Oh, no, no, no, no. (Laughter.)\nQ Okay, his question was, he is a small business owner and he wanted to know what can you do for the self-employed -- for self-employed businesses with less than 10 employees working with him.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to let him go ahead and ask his question. (Laughter.) And then, I'm going to call on two women in a row. (Applause.) Because this is -- we got cheated here. (Laughter.)\nGo ahead. Next time, you stand up. Don't send your wife out first. (Laughter and applause.)\nQ Okay, I'm Tony White and hello, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Good to see you, Tony. What kind of business do you have?\nQ A barbershop and beauty salon.\nTHE PRESIDENT: There you go.\nQ I've been in business for over 10 years now.\nTHE PRESIDENT: That's great.\nQ And what I'm trying to find out is what will you be doing, or if there's anything you'll be doing, for the self-employed and businesses with employees -- with less than 10 employees.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Absolutely.\nQ And also, when can I cut your hair? (Laughter and applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, let me answer the second question first. You know that you would not want a President who is disloyal to his barber. (Laughter and applause.) I mean, a man and his barber, that's a strong connection. (Laughter.)\nQ I know, I know.\nTHE PRESIDENT: So I am not going to let you cut my hair because my barber would be hurt. (Laughter.)\nQ Just one time, just once. (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: Maybe I’ll let you give me a line -- a little bit.\nQ Yeah, yeah, we can do that. (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: All right, in terms of small business -- look, small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy. They account for most of the new job growth. We’ve got obviously great big businesses. In this area, Proctor & Gamble is an example of an outstanding large business. But a lot of the job growth happens with small businesses who then become medium-sized businesses and then maybe at some point become large businesses.\nSo ever since I came into office, one of my biggest priorities was how do we support small businesses -- which is why we’ve actually provided 18 different tax breaks just targeted at small business since I’ve been in office. It’s the reason why we have pushed the Small Business Administration, especially when the recession had just hit, to extend additional financing and to waive fees for small business, because one of the biggest challenges for small businesses is getting credit lines.\nQ Yes, it is.\nTHE PRESIDENT: And we’ve actually been pushing the banks to say, look, taxpayers pulled your backside out of the fire -- (applause) -- it’s now important for you to step up and make sure that small businesses aren’t finding their credit restricted, especially if they’ve been in business for a while.\nThe other thing we’ve done is to say, what are the critical needs of small business? A lot of time, one of the biggest challenges is to make sure that you, as a sole proprietor, that you can get health insurance for you and your family. So when you hear about the Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare -- (applause) -- and I don’t mind the name because I really do care. That’s why we passed it. (Applause.) You should know that once we have fully implemented, you’re going to be able to buy insurance through a pool so that you can get the same good rates as a group that if you’re an employee at a big company you can get right now -- which means your premiums will go down. (Applause.)\nWe will also give you additional tax credits if you are providing health insurance for your employees -- we’ll give you tax credits for that. Right now, one of the things we’re pushing Congress to do is to give you a tax credit if you hire additional workers, or you give folks who are a working for you a raise. We want to give you incentive to do that. (Applause.)\nBut this is an example of where there’s a contrast between myself and my opponent. As I said before, his basic tax plan is to give folks at the top a tax break. Now, we can have that debate, but what I’ve said is, in the meantime, let’s give 98 percent of individuals and 97 percent of small businesses some certainty right now by going ahead and passing a law that says your taxes won’t go up. Because if Congress doesn't act, by the way, by January 1st, everybody’s taxes here are going to go up, by an average of about $1,600 -- if Congress doesn't do anything. And so what I’ve said is if you really want to help small business right now, give 97 percent of them the certainty that their costs will not go up. (Applause.) And then we can have a debate about the other 2, 3 percent.\nNow, one last point I’m going to make on this small business and taxes argument -- you’ll hear Republicans say, you know what, if you tax, let’s say, somebody with a million dollars of income, you're going to be crushing the small business jobs creators. Now, first of all, I’ve just explained 97 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000 a year. But setting aside that, the way they describe small businesses, half of the Fortune 400 richest Americans in the country would qualify as a \"small business.\" Hedge fund managers would qualify as small business, even if they were pulling in a billion dollars a year. And this is an example of what I mean when I say we just want everybody to be treated fairly.\nAUDIENCE: Right!\nTHE PRESIDENT: Michelle and I were talking the other day, and Michelle’s dad worked as a blue-collar worker. He was at the water filtration plant in Chicago, worked there all his life -- all his adult life. And he had MS, so by the time I met him, he could barely walk. But he never missed a day of work. He had to use two canes. He had to wake up an hour earlier than everybody else just to get dressed. But he never missed a day of work. And he took pride in being at the job, even if he didn’t feel well. And he used to tease folks who were lazy -- he'd say, these people are so lazy they won't even go to work to pick up their paycheck. (Laughter.) They want it mailed to them.\nAnd Michelle's mom, she stayed at home when the kids were young and then she went to work as a secretary. And she worked as a secretary most of her adult life.\nSo the point is, they didn’t have a lot. But Michelle and I were talking about how they didn’t envy people who had a lot more. There was no sense that somehow our lives are less because we're not millionaires, we're not making huge amounts of money. God bless folks who are doing successful -- who are successful and doing well. The only thing that Michelle's parents, my mom, my grandparents, the only thing they didn’t like is when you felt like folks at the top were taking advantage of their position and not following the same rules as everybody else and keeping other folks down. (Applause.)\nAnd we don’t want an economy in which some are being treated differently than others. That’s all. And that’s especially true when it comes for our small business folks. I want them to have some of the same advantages, because you probably can't afford the same number of lawyers and accountants and all that stuff that are working all these loopholes. And I want to make sure that you're getting the same good deal as everybody else.\nAll right? Okay. (Applause.)\nI'm going to call on this young lady right here. She seems like she has an urgent question. Hold on, wait for your mic. Wait for your microphone. We're getting the next generation involved in this. (Applause.) Right here, right there. Yes.\nQ What's your favorite Girl Scout cookie? (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: Oh, oh. I've got to say this is one of the toughest questions. (Laughter.) What's your name?\nQ Julie.\nTHE PRESIDENT: And you’re a member of a Girl Scout troupe? Are you?\nQ Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT: How long have you been a Girl Scout?\nQ I think for only -- I think only this year.\nTHE PRESIDENT: This year? Have you --\nQ Two years.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Two years. Have you been having fun?\nQ Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes? You know, I've got to say that I'm pretty partial to those mint -- (applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: I'm just saying -- that’s just me. I didn’t mean to create controversy here. There was someone -- (laughter) -- did you hear there was somebody booing. What do you -- how do you -- what's was your choice? Who was booing up there? (Laughter.) You had a different opinion. What are you, oatmeal, or --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Peanut butter.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Peanut butter is quite good, too, but I'm going with the mint. I'm going with the mint.\nAll right? Thank you for the question. Thank you. (Applause.)\nAll right. Remember I said I was going to go two ladies right now. So here, right here. Right here. Here we go. Whoops, don't fall, now. Go ahead.\nQ My name is Susan. Welcome to Cincinnati.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\nQ Given how divided the country is, if elected, how do you plan to try to united everyone?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I'll be honest, sometimes people ask me what's my disappointment since I've come into office. And obviously, we're always trying to grow the economy faster, put people back to work faster. But one of the disappointments I've had is that we have not changed the tone in Washington the way I wanted to. (Applause.)\nNow, part of this just has to do with the fact that the other side had a basic economic -- or a basic political theory after I got elected -- and this is not my opinion. I mean, this has been said by the leader of the Senate minority in Washington. And the basic theory was, you know what, we kind of screwed things up; Obama is really popular right now; if we cooperate with him, then he'll get credit, so we're better off just saying no. And if we do that, then over time folks will forget the mess he inherited and we can go after him, and hopefully that will help our politics. Again, this is not my theory. This is explicitly their strategy.\nWhat's true is also we've got, as I said, two different visions about how to move the country forward. But my hope is that this election allows us to, once and for all, resolve some of the bigger questions about how we move the country forward -- because right now we've got as stark a choice as you could imagine. I believe in investing in education and transportation and science and research, and bringing down our deficits in a balanced way, and changing our tax code to make sure that companies that are investing here are doing better.\nMr. Romney has the opposite view on almost all those positions. On things like \"don't ask, don't tell\", Mr. Romney wants to reverse my position. On issues like immigration -- I believe in comprehensive immigration reform; he does not. On issues related to women, I believe that Planned Parenthood does a lot of good, and that women's health -- (applause) -- women should be able to control their own health care decisions. (Applause.) He does not.\nOn Iraq, he said me ending the war was \"tragic.\" I said I think it was the right thing to do. (Applause.) On Afghanistan, I imposed a deadline, a timetable for when we're going to bring our troops home. He wants to extend their stay indefinitely. So on all these issues, we've got just profound differences.\nNow, you guys ultimately are the arbiters of this disagreement. And in this election, if the American people decide you know what, we want to try what Mr. Romney is offering --\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I mean, that's the great thing about democracy, is people can vote and make up their minds. And so, if that's the case, then you can count on Mr. Romney implementing the plan that he and the Republicans in Congress have put forward. So $5 trillion in tax cuts, massive cuts in a lot of the programs that are so important, from my perspective, to growing the economy -- those will be eliminated. Medicare will be voucherized. They will implement what they say they're going to implement.\nBut if I'm elected, not only do I think that we'll be able to continue the progress that we've made over the last three and a half years, I actually think that a lot of Republicans, since this will be my last election, they will not be as interested in just beating me, and maybe they’ll be more interested in moving the country forward. That's my hope. (Applause.)\nAnd I have to say the truth is on most of these issues, there shouldn’t be so much partisan rancor because most of the positions I’ve taken are positions that used to be supported by Republicans. (Applause.)\nAnd if you want just one good example -- health care. (Applause.) The bill I passed is in all respects similar to what Mr. Romney passed in Massachusetts. It’s working really well there. He should be proud of it instead of running away from it. And the original idea of using the private sector to make sure that everybody had health care -- that originated as a Republican idea. And I said, fine, I’m willing to work with your ideas to make progress.\nSo I actually think that there are a number of Republican members of Congress who right now feel as if they’ve got to toe the party line. But if the objective is no longer just beating me, my hope is that they’ll be more open to finding common-sense solutions to the problems that our country faces. And I know that is absolutely a goal of mine because in the end, we are not Democrats or Republicans first, we are Americans first. That's what I believe. (Applause.)\nAll right. I’ve got time for two more questions. This gentleman in the blue shirt right there. All right, I’ll end over here. (Laughter.) Go ahead.\nQ Mr. President, my name is Jeff Weitzel (ph) and I have been teaching more 21 years.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Congratulations. (Applause.)\nQ Thank you. I teach at a vocational school, career-tech school. And my question to you is -- we’ve been talking about jobs, we’ve been talking about kids, we’ve been talking about -- I know you want every kid to go to college, but not every kid is going to go to college. We need people to work. We need people to be plumbers and build bridges and those kinds of things. And what I want to -- (applause) -- I believe it, I really do.\nWe do miracles at our school. We take kids who have had really rough lives and we make them productive. But the problem is, is that they are not getting enough chances to get to go to work right away. We have advisory boards, but they advisory boards are free, and these people are not getting paid. What we need -- and I was hoping that you could tell if this is something in your agenda -- can we have people come in, give tax breaks to these companies to come and help schools to teach the schools what they really need for these kids? And that’s what we’re looking for. (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, thank you for teaching. Most important job there is. (Applause.) We appreciate that. Second of all, I want to be very clear. When I say everybody needs a higher education, I don’t mean everybody has got to take a four-year college education. The point is that, these days, if you want to be a plumber, if you want to be an electrician, you want to be working in a factory, you are generally going to need a little bit more training than high school provides -- which is why our community college system is so important.\nBut you are absolutely right that one of the, I believe, mistakes we made 20, 30 years ago was to start deemphasizing vocational education -- (applause) -- because not everybody wants to sit in a classroom with a book. A lot of folks want to do stuff. And right now, we’ve got shortages of folks in fields that need technical training but don’t necessarily require a four-year college degree.\nAnd so part of what I’m talking to Secretary of Education Arne Duncan about is how do we work with high schools so that young people who've got an aptitude -- whether it’s in graphic design or in electronics, or you name it -- that they can start getting on a pathway so that they are being trained for the jobs that actually exist now; they’re being matched up with companies that are hiring now. They maybe start apprenticing junior, senior year in high school; maybe it extends to another year or two in community college. And by the time they’re 21, 22, 23, they are expert in fields where we know there is hiring taking place right now.\nSo it’s very important. We’re going to be working with states, local governments, schools districts, and community colleges to try to figure out how we can expand what is already a proven idea in a lot of places around the country.\nAnd so, you and I, we’re right there. We’re thinking the same way. And I’m looking forward to seeing if we can make progress on this. (Applause.)\nAll right, last question. I promised -- no, I’m going to call on this young lady right here. This is the last question, and we got to get a mic to her. But it’s nice to see you, young man. (Laughter.) That’s a good-looking young man, isn’t he? He’s a handsome young guy. (Laughter.) All right, go ahead.\nQ Hi. My father, he’s an unemployed construction worker and he’s on unemployment. So as your job as President, will he have a job before his unemployment runs out?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, this is an important question. What’s your name?\nQ Taylor.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Taylor. How old are you, Taylor?\nQ I will be 13 in two months.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, so nice to meet you, and I’m glad you’re thinking about your dad, because I know he wants to work.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: That's my granddaughter.\nTHE PRESIDENT: My hope is, is that we can put him to work.\nHousing took the biggest hit in our economy because you had this big housing bubble that collapsed, so the construction industry, the industry where your dad works, was the hardest hit of any industry and it’s the one that’s been the slowest to come back -- which is why, since September of last year, I have urged Congress to expand our efforts to rebuild roads, bridges, schools, laying broadband lines going into rural communities -- making sure that all these folks, like your father, who want to work -- these aren’t folks who are looking for a handout, they want to be on the job -- so that they have an opportunity to do work that we’re going to have to do anyway.\nAnd this is important. How many folks here have a house and you know that you’ve got a leaky roof? Do you -- you can put off patching up that leaky roof, but sooner or later, you’re going to have to patch it up. Sooner or later. And if you don't, what happens?\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Falls in.\nTHE PRESIDENT: It falls in. And then what happens? It’s more expensive. Same is true if you got a busted boiler. So we all have what’s called deferred maintenance. We can't always do it right away, but a lot of times, if we have an opportunity to do it, we should go ahead and do it, especially if it’s cheap.\nIt is cheaper now to do it than it will be later. Interest rates are low. Construction workers are out of work. Contractors are begging for work. They’ll come in on time, under budget. And so we could knock out a whole bunch of work that needs to get done for this country anyway, and put people back to work, which would grow the economy right now.\nNow, so far, I have not gotten a positive response from members of Congress on the other side of the aisle. They did just pass -- and this was a sign of some modest cooperation, so it makes me feel a little bit encouraged -- they did just pass a transportation bill that at least wouldn’t lay off more construction workers.\nBut the first thing I want to do was put your dad back on the job rebuilding America. Now, if your father still doesn't get a job, though, part of what I’m also looking for is making sure that unemployment insurance is there for folks who want to work but are having trouble finding work. (Applause.)\nAnd I want folks to be clear: Unemployment insurance -- unemployment benefits, they're paid for. Your employer paid for them. Directly and indirectly, you paid for them. The idea is to have that safety net because everybody once in a while can have some bad luck.\nNow, we tried to extend unemployment insurance beyond normal right after the recession hit. We were able to extend it again in 2010. It’s been harder now to get Congress to extend it further. And I don't know exactly what category your father falls in, but my bottom line is, my general view is that as long as the economy is weak and somebody is willing and able to work, and looking for work actively -- which is what's required if you want to get unemployment insurance -- then we should be there for them to make sure that they can pay the rent and look after their families.\nAnd so we'll continue to negotiate with Congress to make sure that unemployment is there. But the most important thing I want to do is make sure your dad can get a job. (Applause.)\nLet me just say, everybody, I am going to be back in Cincinnati. I'm going to be back in Ohio. (Applause.) I want to thank you for your attention. And I want to explicitly ask you for your support. (Applause.)\nThis is going to be a close election. This is going to be a close election and it is going to be an important debate. And I want everybody to understand that what I've tried to do over the last three and a half years is to keep my promises. So I promised I'd end the war in Iraq -- I ended it. (Applause.) I promised that we would keep taxes low for middle-class families -- I did that. (Applause.)\nBut the most important promise I made -- some of you remember me saying this in 2008 -- I said, you know I'm not a perfect man; I said, I wasn't going to be a perfect President -- no President is. But what I promised you was that I would always tell you what I thought, I'd always tell you what I believed, and I would wake up every single day fighting as hard as I knew how for you. (Applause.) And you know what, I have kept that promise.\nBecause when I look around this room, if I see an elderly couple I think about my grandparents and everything they did for me. And when I see this young lady asking about her dad, I think about my daughters. I see myself in you. And my most important job is fighting for you and that basic American idea that if you work hard in this country, you can succeed, you can get ahead. (Applause.)\nAnd I'm going to do everything I can, as long as I have the honor of being President, to fight for you and working families and middle-class families all across this country. (Applause.) So I hope you'll stand with me. I hope you'll work with me. Let's finish what we started, and remind the world why the United States is the great nation that it is.\nGod bless you and God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)\nEND\n3:04 P.M. EDT\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Remarks by the President and Governor Romney in the First Presidential Debate\nMagness Arena\nUniversity of Denver\nDenver, Colorado\n7:00 P.M. MDT\nMR. LEHRER: Good evening from the Magness Arena at the University of Denver, in Denver, Colorado. I'm Jim Lehrer of the PBS News Hour, and I welcome you to the first of the 2012 Presidential Debates between President Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee.\nThis debate and the next three -- two presidential, one vice presidential -- are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight's 90 minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the Commission. There will be six roughly 15-minute segments, with 2-minute answers for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment.\nThousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the Internet and other means. But I made the final selections. And for the record, they were not submitted for approval to the Commission or the candidates.\nThe segments, as I announced in advance, will be three on the economy, and one each on health care, the role of government, and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences, specifics, and choices. Both candidates will also have 2-minute closing statements.\nThe audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, applause, boos, hisses, among other noisy, distracting things, so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say.\nThere is a noise exception right now, though, as we welcome President Obama and Governor Romney. (Applause.)\nGentlemen, welcome to you both. Let's start with the economy, segment one, and let's begin with jobs. What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs? You have two minutes -- each of you have two minutes to start. A coin toss has determined, Mr. President, you go first.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to thank Governor Romney, and the University of Denver for your hospitality.\nThere are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me. (Laughter.) And so I just want to wish, sweetie, you happy anniversary, and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people. (Laughter.)\nFour years ago, we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost. The auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up. And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we’ve begun to fight our way back. Over the last 30 months, we’ve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back and housing has begun to rise.\nBut we all know that we’ve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where we’ve been, but where we’re going.\nGovernor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes skewed towards the wealthy and roll back regulations that we’ll be better off. I’ve got a different view. I think we’ve got to invest in education and training. I think it’s important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America; that we change our tax code to make sure that we’re helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States; that we take some of the money that we’re saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America; and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.\nNow, ultimately, it’s going to be up to the voters -- to you -- which path we should take. Are we going to double down on the top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess? Or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best? And I’m looking forward to having that debate.\nMR. LEHRER: Governor Romney, two minutes.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim. It’s an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the President. I’m pleased to be at the University of Denver. I appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.\nAnd congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary. I’m sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here with me. (Laughter.) Congratulations.\nThis is obviously a very tender topic. I’ve had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country -- I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, I’ve been out of work since May, can you help me? Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. He’s lost his most recent job and we’ve now just lost our home. Can you help us?\nAnd the answer is, yes, we can help, but it’s going to take a different path -- not the one we’ve been on, not the one the President describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. That’s not what I’m going to do. My plan has five basic parts: One, get us energy independent -- North America energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs. Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America; crack down on China if and when they cheat. Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world -- we are far away from that now. Number four, get us to a balanced budget. Number five, champion small business.\nIt’s small business that creates the jobs in America. And over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business, because new business startups are down to a 30-year low. I know what it takes to get small business growing again, to hire people.\nNow, I’m concerned that the path that we’re on has just been unsuccessful. The President has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years ago, that a bigger government spending more, taxing more, regulating more -- if you will, trickle-down government -- would work. That's not the right answer for America. I'll restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you.\nMR. LEHRER: Mr. President, please respond directly to what the Governor just said about trickle-down, his trickle-down approach, as he said yours is.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, we've got to improve our education system. And we've made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools.\nWe've got a program called Race To The Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers. So now, I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.\nWhen it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high. So I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas\n-- I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.\nOn energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we've got to boost American energy production. And oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years. But I also believe that we've got to look at the energy sources of the future like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.\nSo all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit. And one of the things I'm sure we'll be discussing tonight is how do we deal with our tax code and how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also how do we have enough revenue to make those investments.\nAnd this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for. That's $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.\nMR. LEHRER: Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things. And we're going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can. But first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that you'd like to ask the President directly about something he just said?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Well, sure, I'd like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece. First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don't have a tax cut of the scale that you're talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They'll do fine whether you're President or I am.\nThe people who are having a hard time right now are middle-income Americans. Under the President's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They're just being crushed. Middle-income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a tax in and of itself. I'll call it the economy tax. It's been crushing.\nAt the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the President, electric rates are up, food prices are up, health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed. And so the question is how to get them going again? And I've described it. It's energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the cornerstones of my plan.\nBut the President mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note. First, education. I agree education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we've got 47 of them housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We've got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.\nThe second area, taxation: We agree we ought to bring the tax rates down, and I do -- both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue and have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.\nThe third area, energy: Energy is critical, and the President pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up -- but not due to his policies, in spite of his policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half.\nIf I’m President, I’ll double them and also get the oil from offshore in Alaska, and I’ll bring that pipeline in from Canada. And by the way, I like coal. I’m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it’s getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.\nAnd finally with regards to that tax cut, look, I’m not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the revenues going to the government. My number-one principle is there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that -- no tax cut that adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.\nMR. LEHRER: Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, let’s talk about taxes because I think it’s instructive. Now, four years ago when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families, and that's exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.\nAnd the reason is because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid who is going off to college, which means they're spending more money; businesses have more customers; businesses make more profits and then hire more workers.\nNow, Governor Romney’s proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that he’s been asked over a hundred times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn’t been able to identify them.\nBut I’m going to make an important point here, Jim. When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don’t come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.\nAnd that’s why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney’s pledge of not reducing the deficit -- or not adding to the deficit, is by burdening middle-class families; the average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.\nNow, that’s not my analysis. That’s the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And that kind of top-down economics where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making 3 million bucks is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that’s not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.\nMR. LEHRER: All right, what is the difference? Let’s just stay on taxes for a --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: But I get -- right, right.\nMR. LEHRER: Let’s just stay on taxes for a moment here.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Yes. Well, but virtually --\nMR. LEHRER: What is the difference?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: -- virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.\nMR. LEHRER: All right.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I’d say, absolutely not. I’m not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I’ve said is, I won’t put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That’s part one. So there’s no economist who can say Mitt Romney’s tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.\nNumber two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. I know that you and your running mate keep saying that, and I know it’s a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it’s just not the case. Look, I’ve got five boys. I’m used to people saying something that’s not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I’ll believe it. (Laughter.) But that is not the case, all right? I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.\nAnd number three, I will not, under any circumstances, raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you described and say it’s completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said you’re going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families. There are all these studies out there.\nBut let’s get to the bottom line. That is, I want to bring down rates. I want to bring the rates down, at the same time, lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And you think, well, then why lower the rates? And the reason is, because small business pays that individual rate. Fifty-four percent of America’s workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people.\nFor me, this is about jobs. This is about getting jobs for the American people.\nMR. LEHRER: All right, that’s where we started. Yes.\nDo you challenge what the Governor just said about his own plan?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, for 18 months, he’s been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, he’s saying that his big, bold idea is \"never mind.\" And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. It’s math. It’s arithmetic.\nNow, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small business 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates -- the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.\nBut I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was President, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot. And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we can not only reduce the deficit, we can not only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we’re also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.\nAnd we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they’re the job creators, they’d be burdened. But under Governor Romney’s definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business -- and I know Donald Trump doesn’t like to think of himself as small anything. But that’s how you define small businesses if you’re getting business income.\nAnd that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research -- all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake.\nMR. LEHRER: All right.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Jim, let me just come back on that point, which is these --\nMR. LEHRER: Just for the record --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: -- small businesses we’re talking about --\nMR. LEHRER: Excuse me, just so everybody understands, we’re way over our first 15 minutes.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: It’s fun, isn’t it?\nMR. LEHRER: It’s okay. It’s great.\nTHE PRESIDENT: That’s okay.\nMR. LEHRER: Great, no problem. As long as you all don’t have a problem, I don’t have a problem.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: That’s good.\nMR. LEHRER: Because we’re still on the economy. We’re going to come back to taxes, and we’re going to move on to the deficit and a lot of other things, too. But go ahead, sir.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: You bet. President, you’re -- Mr. President, you’re absolutely right, which is that with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they’re taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half -- half -- of all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.\nNow, I talked to a guy who has a very small business. He’s in the electronics business in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes -- federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.\nI don’t want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions -- the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way. Get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions to create more jobs, because there’s nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. That’s by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Jim, you may want to move on to another topic, but I would just say this to the American people: If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for -- $7 trillion -- just to give you a sense, over 10 years, that’s more than our entire defense budget -- and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney’s plan may work for you.\nBut I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that’s not a recipe for job growth. Look, we’ve tried this -- we’ve tried both approaches. The approach that Governor Romney is talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003. And we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years. We ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\nBill Clinton tried the approach that I’m talking about. We created 23 million new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus. And businesses did very well. So in some ways we’ve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans. And I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they’ve got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we’re not blowing up the deficit.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: The President began this segment, so I think I get the last word. So I’m going to take it.\nMR. LEHRER: You’re going to get the first part in the next segment.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: But he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word of that segment -- well, I hope -- let me just make this comment.\nMR. LEHRER: That's not how it works.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Let me repeat what I said. I’m not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. That's not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit. That's point one. So you may keep referring to the $5 trillion tax cut, but that's not my plan.\nNumber two, let’s look at history. My plan is not like anything that's been tried before. My plan is to bring down rates but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time, so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working. My priority is putting people back to work in America. They’re suffering in this country.\nAnd we talk about evidence. Look at the evidence of the last four years. It’s absolutely extraordinary. We’ve got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country. It’s just -- we’ve got -- when the President took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year; and last year slower than the year before. Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.\nMR. LEHRER: All right, let’s talk -- we’re still on the economy. This is theoretically now a second segment, still on the economy, and specifically on what to do about the federal deficit, the federal debt. And the question -- you each have two minutes on this. And Governor Romney, you go first because the President went first on segment one.\nAnd the question is this: What are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Good, I’m glad you raised that, and it’s a critical issue. I think it’s not just an economic issue. I think it’s a moral issue. I think it’s, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to passed on to the next generation, and they’re going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives. And the amount of debt we’re adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.\nSo how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number three is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they’re paying taxes and you can get the job done that way.\nThe President would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth, and you can never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.\nWhat things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it’s worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, I’ll get rid of it. Obamacare is on my list. I apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect.\nTHE PRESIDENT: I like it.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Okay, good. So I’ll get rid of that. I’m sorry, Jim, I’m going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I’m going to stop other things. I like PBS. I love Big Bird. I actually like you, too. But I’m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for it. That's number one.\nNumber two, I’ll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.\nNumber three, I’ll make government more efficient and cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.\nThis is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget. The President said he’d cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it -- trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years. The President has put in place as much public debt -- almost as much debt held by the public as all prior Presidents combined.\nMR. LEHRER: Mr. President, two minutes.\nTHE PRESIDENT: When I walked into the Oval Office I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me, and we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card, two tax cuts that were not paid for, and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for, and then a massive economic crisis.\nAnd despite that, what we’ve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn’t slip into a Great Depression, but what we’ve also said it let’s make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow. So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren’t working very well, 18 government programs for education that were well intentioned but weren’t helping kids learn.\nWe went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars -- $50 billion of waste taken out of the system. And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. That’s the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.\nNow, we all know that we’ve got to do more, and so I put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. It’s on a website, you can look at all the numbers -- what cuts we make and what revenue we raise. And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut we ask for $1 of additional revenue paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit.\nGovernor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that’s how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward, suggested we have to do it -- in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have. Let me just finish this point because you’re looking for contrast.\nWhen Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination, and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no. Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that -- Governor Romney talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively, this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities. And that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.\nMR. LEHRER: Way over the two minutes.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Sorry.\nMR. LEHRER: Governor, what about Simpson-Bowles? Will you support Simpson-Bowles?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Simpson-Bowles, the President should have grabbed that.\nMR. LEHRER: I mean do you support Simpson-Bowles?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: I have my own plan. It’s not the same as Simpson-Bowles. But in my view, the President should have grabbed it. If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.\nTHE PRESIDENT: That's what we’ve done, made some adjustments to it, and we’re putting it forward before Congress right now -- a $4 trillion plan --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: But you’ve been -- but you’ve been President four years --\nTHE PRESIDENT: -- a balanced --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: You’ve been President four years. You said you’d cut the deficit in half. It’s now four years later; we still have trillion-dollar deficits. The CBO says we’ll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. If you’re reelected we’ll get to a trillion-dollar debt. But you have said before you’d cut the deficit in half. And I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts -- you found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That doesn't get the job done.\nLet me come back and say, why is that I don't want to raise taxes? Why don't I want to raise taxes on people? And actually you said it. Back in 2010, you said, look, I’m going to extend the tax policies that we have. Now, I’m not going to raise taxes on anyone because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we’re in recession, you shouldn’t raise taxes on anyone. Well, the economy is still going slow. As a matter of fact, it’s growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just don't want to raise taxes on people.\nAnd the reality is, it’s not just wealthy people -- you mentioned Donald Trump -- it’s not just Donald Trump you’re taxing. It’s all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America, these small businesses that are taxed as individuals. You raise taxes and you kill jobs. That's why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs. I don't want to kill jobs in this environment.\nI’ll make one more point.\nMR. LEHRER: Let’s let him answer the taxes thing for a moment.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Okay.\nMR. LEHRER: Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, we’ve had this discussion before --\nMR. LEHRER: No, about the idea that in order to reduce the deficit there has to be revenue in addition to cuts.\nTHE PRESIDENT: There has to be revenue in addition to cuts. Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue. He’s ruled out revenue.\nMR. LEHRER: Is that --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Absolutely. Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes. That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget. But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you’ll never get there. You never balance the budget by raising taxes. Spain -- Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government. We’re now spending 42 percent of our economy on government. I don't want to go down the path of Spain. I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because they're working.\nMR. LEHRER: But, Mr. President, you’re saying in order to get the job done, it’s got to be balanced.\nTHE PRESIDENT: If we’re serious, we’ve got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Let’s talk about corporate taxes. Now, I’ve identified areas where we can right away make a change that I believe would actually help the economy. The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get. Now, does anybody think that Exxon Mobil needs some extra money when they're making money every time you go to the pump?\nWhy wouldn’t we want to eliminate that? Why wouldn’t we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.\nWhen it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to in a revenue-neutral way close loopholes, deductions -- he hasn’t identified which ones they are -- but thereby bring down the corporate rate. Well, I want to do the same thing, but I’ve actually identified how we can do that. And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Right now you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense. And all that raises revenue.\nAnd so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college. It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me she's got 42 kids in her class. The first two weeks, she's got some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. They're using textbooks that are 10 years old. That is not a recipe for growth. That's not how America was built.\nAnd so budgets reflect choices. Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions. And if we're asking for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff. And the magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow.\nAs I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30-percent cut in Medicaid over time. Now, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is numbers on a sheet of paper. But if we're talking about a family who's got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that's a big problem. And governors are creative, there's no doubt about it. But they're not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Jim, we've gone on a lot of topics there. And so it's going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools --\nMR. LEHRER: Come back to Medicaid, yes.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: -- to oil to tax breaks and companies going overseas. So let's go through them one by one.\nFirst of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year. And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years.\nTHE PRESIDENT: It's time to end it.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green-energy world. Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives. And you say Exxon and Mobil, actually those $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.\nBut you know if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why, that $2.8 billion is on the table. Of course it's on the table. That's probably not going to survive if you get that rate down to 25 percent. But don't forget, you put $90 billion -- like 50 years' worth of breaks -- into solar and wind -- to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1. I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers. So this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.\nThe second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas -- look, I've been in business for 25 years. I have no idea what you're talking about. I maybe need to get a new accountant. But the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case. What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.\nAnd finally, Medicaid to states -- I'm not quite sure where that came in except this, which is I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year plus inflation, plus 1 percent. And then, you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.\nAnd I remember as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that. We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.\nOne of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy. Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have. Let states do this. And, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we could step in and see if we could find a way to help them.\nMR. LEHRER: Let's go.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: But the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government.\nMR. LEHRER: We're going on -- still on the economy, but another part of it. All right, this is segment three, the economy. Entitlements, first answer goes to you -- two minutes, Mr. President. Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I suspect that on Social Security we’ve got a somewhat similar position. Social Security is structurally sound. It’s going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Democratic Speaker Tip O’Neill. But the basic structure is sound.\nBut I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare because that’s the big driver of our deficits right now.\nMy grandmother, some of you know, helped to raise me -- my grandparents did. My grandfather died a while back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected President. And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up -- only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended up living alone by choice. And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare.\nShe had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go. And that’s the perspective I bring when I think about what’s called entitlements. The name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.\nSo my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term. And in Medicare, what we did was we said we are going to have to bring down the costs if we’re going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that let’s look where some of the money is going -- $716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies, by making sure that we weren’t overpaying providers, and using that money we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money throughout the system.\nSo the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don’t need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.\nMR. LEHRER: We’ll follow up on this. First, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know any time we talk about entitlements people become concerned that something is going to happen that’s going to change their life for the worse. And the answer is, neither the President, nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near-retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if you’re 60 or around 60 or older, you don’t need to listen any further.\nBut for younger people we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring -- oh, I just thought about one, and that is in fact I was wrong when I said the President isn’t proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact, he is on Medicare. On Social Security he’s not. But on Medicare, for current retirees, he’s cutting $716 billion from the program -- now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers, actually, just going to them and saying we’re going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody is going to get a lower rate. That saying we're cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take any more Medicare patients under that scenario. We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.\nWe have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I can't understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients in Medicare. Now, you point out, well, we're putting some back, we're going to give a better prescription program. That's $1 for every $15 you've cut. They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.\nI want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it. But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.\nWith regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.\nMR. LEHRER: Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT: First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future. And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program. It's called Premium Support, but it's understood to be a voucher program.\nMR. LEHRER: And you don't support that?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I don't. And let me explain why.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Again, that's for future people --\nTHE PRESIDENT: I understand.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: -- not for current retirees.\nTHE PRESIDENT: So if you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen, because this will affect you.\nThe idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance. The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.\nNow, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it. But there's still a problem, because what happens is those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors. They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare, and every health care economist who looks at it says over time what will happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse. And then what you've got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.\nSo I don't think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not my -- only my opinion. AARP thinks that the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolstered the system, lengthened the Medicare trust fund by eight years. Benefits were not affected at all.\nAnd ironically, if you repeal Obamacare -- and I have become fond of this term, Obamacare -- (laughter) -- if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care. They're now going to have to be paying co-pays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier. And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren’t making seniors any healthier. And I don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.\nMR. LEHRER: We'll talk about -- specifically about health care in a moment. But do you support the voucher system, Governor?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare. And the President supports taking $716 billion out of that program.\nMR. LEHRER: What about the voucher --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: So that's number one. Number two is, for people coming along that are young, what I'd do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan -- their choice. They get to -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them. So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000 -- that's not going to happen. They'll have at least two plans.\nAnd by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare. Or they'll be able to get a private plan. I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan. I know I’d just as soon not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get. I’d rather be able to have an insurance company. If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. Let people make their own choice.\nThe other thing we have to do to save Medicare, we have to have the benefits high for those that are low-income. But for higher-income people, we’re going to have to lower some of the benefits. We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.\nThat's the plan that I put forward. And by the way, the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or Senator Wyden, who is a co-author of the bill with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill Clinton’s Chief of Staff. This is an idea that's been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let’s see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe in competition.\nMR. LEHRER: Okay.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Jim, if I can just respond very quickly. First of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it. And private insurers have to make a profit. Nothing wrong with that, that's what they do. And so you’ve got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that, and if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney is proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.\nAnd when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck. And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially. And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.\nOne last point I want to make: We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare, but --\nMR. LEHRER: We'll talk about that in a minute.\nTHE PRESIDENT: -- but overall.\nMR. LEHRER: Okay.\nTHE PRESIDENT: And so --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: That's a big topic. Can we stay on Medicare?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Is that a separate topic?\nMR. LEHRER: Yes, we’re going to -- yes, I want to get to it.\nTHE PRESIDENT: I’m sorry.\nMR. LEHRER: But all I want to do is very quickly before we leave the economy --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Let’s get back to Medicare. Let’s get back to Medicare.\nMR. LEHRER: Governor --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: The President said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.\nMR. LEHRER: All right.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.\nMR. LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor. Wait a minute.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: But my experience -- my experience is the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.\nMR. LEHRER: Can we -- can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice, a clear choice between the two of you on Medicare?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Absolutely.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Absolutely.\nMR. LEHRER: All right. So, to finish quickly, briefly on the economy, what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now? Is there too much? And in your case, Mr. President, is there -- should there be more? Beginning with you -- this is not a new two-minute segment. Just start, and we’ll go for a few minutes, and then we’re going to go to health care, okay?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Regulation is essential. You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation. As a businessperson, I had to have -- I needed to know the regulations. I needed them there. You could have people opening up banks in their garage and making loans. You have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work. Every free economy has good regulation. At the same time, regulation can become excessive.\nMR. LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: In some places, yes.\nMR. LEHRER: Like where? Let me know.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Other places no. It can become out of date. And what’s happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the President’s term, you’ve seen regulation become excessive and it’s hurt the -- it’s hurt the economy.\nLet me give you an example. Dodd-Frank was passed, and it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy. One is it designates a number of banks as \"too big to fail,\" and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government. This is the biggest kiss that's been given to New York banks I’ve ever seen. This is an enormous boon for them. There have been -- 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd-Frank. So there’s one example.\nHere’s another. In Dodd-Frank, it says if --\nMR. LEHRER: You want to repeal Dodd-Frank?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Well, I would repeal it and replace it. We’re not going to get rid of all regulation. You have to have regulation, and there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world. You need transparency. You need to have leverage limits for institutional --\nMR. LEHRER: Well, there’s a specific --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: But let’s -- but let’s mention --\nMR. LEHRER: Excuse me --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Let me mention the other one. Let’s talk the other big one.\nMR. LEHRER: No, let’s not.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Okay.\nMR. LEHRER: Let’s let him respond -- let’s let him respond to this specific on Dodd-Frank and what the Governor just said.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board. Now, it wasn’t just on Wall Street. You had loan officers that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn’t have been given because the folks didn't qualify. You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn’t afford. You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A-1, great investments when they weren’t. But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn’t even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.\nSo what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s. We said you’ve got -- banks, you’ve got to raise your capital requirements. You can’t engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk. We’re going to make sure that you’ve got to have a living will, so we can know how you’re going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don’t have other taxpayer bailouts.\nIn the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back -- every single dime -- with interest.\nNow, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, and I appreciate and it appears we’ve got some agreement that a marketplace, to work, has to have some regulation. But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just wants to repeal Dodd-Frank. Roll it back. And so the question is does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate. But that’s not what I believe.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Sorry, Jim, but that’s just not the facts. Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. That’s why I’d have regulation. But I wouldn’t designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. That’s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank. It wasn’t thought through properly. We need to get rid of that provision because it’s killing regional and small banks. They’re getting hurt.\nLet me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank. You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren’t qualified. That’s exactly right. It’s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had. And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that’s not qualified, there are big penalties -- except they didn’t ever go on to define what a qualified mortgage was. It’s been two years. We don’t know what a qualified mortgage is yet.\nSo banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. Try and get a mortgage these days. It’s hurt the housing market, because Dodd-Frank didn’t anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. It’s not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation. Sometimes they didn’t come out with a clear regulation.\nI will make sure we don’t hurt the functioning of our marketplace and our businesses, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.\nMR. LEHRER: All right. I think we have another clear difference between the two of you. Now let’s move to health care, where I know there is a clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare. And it’s a two-minute new segment, and that means two minutes each. And you go first, Governor Romney. You want it repealed. You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. Why?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: I sure do. Well, in part it comes, again, from my experience. I was in New Hampshire; a woman came to me and she said, look, I can’t afford insurance for myself or my son. I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we’re thinking of dropping our insurance -- we can’t afford it. And the number of small businesses I’ve gone to that are saying they’re dropping insurance because they can’t afford it -- the cost of health care is just prohibitive, and we’ve got to deal with cost.\nAnd unfortunately, when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. So it’s adding to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the President ran for office, he said that by this year he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family. Instead, it’s gone up by that amount. So it’s expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So that’s one reason I don’t want it.\nSecond reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.\nNumber three, it puts in place an unelected board that’s going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I don’t like that idea.\nFourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country. It said, what’s been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans? And three-quarters of them said, it makes us less likely to hire people. I just don’t know how the President could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people. It has killed jobs.\nAnd the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state -- craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state, and then let’s focus on getting the cost down for people rather than raising it with a $2,500 additional premium.\nMR. LEHRER: Mr. President, the argument against repeal.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, four years ago when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasn’t just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn’t get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. It wasn’t just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care cost. But it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick -- millions of families all across the country.\nIf they had a preexisting condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all. If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. And so, as a consequence, they’re paying their premiums; somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don’t have enough money to pay the bills because the insurance companies say that they’ve hit the limit.\nSo we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country. And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. Number one, if you’ve got health insurance it doesn’t mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies can’t jerk you around. They can’t impose arbitrary lifetime limits. They have to let you keep your kid on your insurance plan until you’re 26 years old. And it also says that you’re going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.\nNumber two, if you don’t have health insurance, we’re essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you’re out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.\nNow, the last point I’d make before --\nMR. LEHRER: Two minutes is up, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I think -- I had five seconds before you interrupted me. (Laughter.) The irony is that we’ve seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state, to set up what is essentially the identical model. And as consequence, people are covered there. It hasn’t destroyed jobs. And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.\nMR. LEHRER: Your five seconds went away a long time ago. (Laughter.)\nAll right, Governor, tell the President directly why you think what he just said is wrong about Obamacare.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Well, I did with my first statement --\nTHE PRESIDENT: You did.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: -- I’ll go on.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Please elaborate.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: I’ll elaborate -- exactly right. (Laughter.)\nFirst of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my state we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary -- elected a Republican senator -- to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway. So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer, and drove it through.\nWhat we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together. Two hundred legislators in my legislature -- only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished.\nWhat were some differences? We didn’t raise taxes. You’ve raised them by a trillion dollars under Obamacare. We didn’t cut Medicare -- of course, we don't have Medicare -- but we didn’t cut Medicare by $716 billion. We didn’t put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they’re going to receive. We didn’t also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put people in a position where they’re going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted.\nRight now the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company, of American Businesses, said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.\nSo for those reasons -- for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance -- this is why the American people don't want Medicare -- don't want Obamacare. It’s why Republicans said, do not do this. And the Republicans had a plan. They put a plan out. They put a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside. I think something this big, this important, has to be done on a bipartisan basis. And we have to have a President who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney, at the beginning of this debate, wrote and said, what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.\nAnd I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is we used the same advisors and they say it’s the same plan.\nWhen Governor Romney talks about this board, for example -- unelected board that we’ve created -- what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall. Because there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured, and let them fend for themselves; to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up and their workers are no longer getting insured -- and that's been the trend line. Or alternatively, we can figure out how do we make the cost of care more effective. And there are ways of doing it.\nSo at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care, cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They say if a patient is coming in, let’s get all the doctors together at once, do one test, instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Let’s make sure that we’re providing preventive care, so we’re catching the onset of something like diabetes. Let’s pay providers on the basis of performance, as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they’ve engaged in.\nNow, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says let’s use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.\nAnd the fact of the matter is that when Obamacare is fully implemented, we’re going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up, it’s true, but they’ve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So we’re already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you’re already getting a rebate.\nLet me make one last point. Governor Romney says we should replace it -- I’m just going to repeal it, but we can replace it with something. But the problem is he hasn’t described what exactly we’d replace it with, other than saying we’re going to leave it to the states. But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he’s offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who has got a preexisting condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, it’s estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you’re looking at 50 million people losing health insurance at a time when it’s vitally important.\nMR. LEHRER: Let’s let the Governor explain what you would do if Obamacare is repealed. How would you replace it? What do you have in mind?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Well, actually, it’s a lengthy description, but number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. That's already offered in the private marketplace. You don't have the government mandate that for that to occur.\nBut let’s come back to something the President and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it’s more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government -- an unelected board, appointed board -- who are going to decide what kind of treatments you ought to have.\nTHE PRESIDENT: No --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: In my opinion, the government is not effective in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the costs than the government will ever be.\nYour example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe. This is the private market. These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs.\nI used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people. In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job for keeping costs down. And that's happening -- Intermountain Health Care does it superbly well. Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well; Cleveland clinic, others.\nBut the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have. That's the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Let me point out, first of all, this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given. That's explicitly prohibited in the law.\nBut let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated -- that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions. Well actually, Governor, that isn't what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if it's been under 90 days.\nBut that's already the law. And that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasn't a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that, insurers, you've got to take everybody. Now, that also means that you've got more customers.\nBut when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something, but can't detail how it will be, in fact, replaced -- and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem -- it just reminds me of -- he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. That's how it's going to be paid for, but we don't know the details. He says that he's going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't know exactly which ones. He won't tell us. He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and assure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.\nAnd at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good? Is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them? No. The reason is because when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of preexisting conditions -- these are tough problems and we've got to make choices -- and the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.\nMR. LEHRER: We're going to move to --\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: No, I have to respond to that -- which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and lay down a piece of legislation and say it's my way or the highway, I don't get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster. He said he was going to lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the base. You’ve said the same thing -- you’re going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.\nThose are my principles. I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families, and I’m going to work together with Congress to say, okay, what are the various ways we can bring down deductions, for instance. One way, for instance, would be to have a single number -- make up a number -- $25,000, $50,000 -- anybody could have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people. That’s one way one could do it.\nOne could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model, and tax deduction by deduction and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth.\nAnd with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my preexisting condition plan. You obviously studied up on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with preexisting conditions; that’s part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation, state by state. And I said that at that time. The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.\nMR. LEHRER: That is a terrific segue to our next segment, and it's the role of government. And let’s see, role of government, and it is -- you are first on this, Mr. President.\nAnd the question is this: Do you believe -- both of you, but you have the first two minutes on this, Mr. President -- do you believe there’s a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I definitely think there are differences. The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe. That’s its most basic function. And as Commander-in-Chief, that is something that I have worked on and thought about every single day that I’ve been in the Oval Office.\nBut I also believe that government has the capacity -- the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed. Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom, and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions. But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together.\nSo in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let’s help to finance the Trans-Continental Railroad. Let’s start the National Academy of Sciences. Let’s start land grant colleges -- because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans -- because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we’re all going to be better off. That doesn’t restrict people’s freedom; that enhances it.\nAnd so what I’ve tried to do as President is to apply those same principles. When it comes to education, what I’ve said is we’ve got to reform schools that are not working. We use something called Race to the Top. It wasn’t a top-down approach, Governor. What we said is to states, we’ll give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence you have 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.\nBut what I’ve also said is let’s hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed. And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that. In fact, we’ve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we need more teachers.\nI do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help. It can't do it all, but it can make a difference. And as a consequence, we’ll have a better-trained workforce, and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we’ve got a skilled workforce.\nMR. LEHRER: Two minutes, Governor, on the role of government. Your view?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Well, first, I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states. And the key to great schools -- great teachers. So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.\nThe role of government: Look behind us -- the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents. First, life and liberty: We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America’s military.\nSecond, in that line that says, \"We are endowed by our Creator with our rights,\" I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our Creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can't care for themselves are cared by -- by one another. We’re a nation that believes that we are all children of the same God, and we care for those that have difficulties. Those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled, we care for them. And we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.\nBut we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what we’re seeing right now is, in my view, a trickle-down government approach which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams, and it’s not working.\nAnd the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is one out of six people in poverty. The proof of that is we’ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can't find work. We know that the path we’re taking is not working. It’s time for a new path.\nMR. LEHRER: All right, let’s go through some specifics in terms of what -- how each of you views the role of government. Education -- does the federal government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in America?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Well, the primary responsibility for education is, of course, at the state and local level. But the federal government also can play a very important role. And I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, some ideas he’s put forward on Race to the Top -- not all of them, but some of them I agree with, and congratulate him for pursuing that. The federal government can get local and state schools to do a better job.\nMy own view, by the way, is I’ve added to that. I happen to believe -- I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I -- these are disabled kids or poor kids -- or lower-income kids, rather -- I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice. So all federal funds, instead of going to the state or to the school district, I’d have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their student.\nMR. LEHRER: How do you see the federal government’s responsibility to, as I say, to improve the quality of public education in this country?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, as I’ve indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play. Through our Race to the Top program, we’ve worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they’re having an impact right now.\nMR. LEHRER: Do you think you have a difference with your views and those of Governor Romney about education and the federal government?\nTHE PRESIDENT: This is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices. So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we’re having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.\nHis running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney has talked about. And it wasn’t very detailed -- this seems to be a trend -- but what it did do is to, if you extrapolated how much money we’re talking about, you’d look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.\nWhen it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now. And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they’re setting up their training programs --\nMR. LEHRER: Do you agree, Governor?\nTHE PRESIDENT: Let me just finish the point.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Oh, sure. Oh, yes. It’s, by the way, going very well in my state, by the way. Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT: I suspect it will be a small agreement -- where they’re partnering so that they’re designing training programs and people who are going through them know that there’s a job waiting for them if they complete it. That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support.\nLet me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether it’s two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as President was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed so there was no risk for the banks or the lenders. But they were taking billions out of the system. And we said why not cut out the middleman? And as a consequence, what we’ve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans.\nAnd this is an example of where our priorities make a difference. Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that you should borrow money from your parents to go to college, that indicates the degree to which there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend the University of Denver just don’t have that option. And for us to be able to make sure that they’ve got that opportunity and they can walk through that door -- that is vitally important -- not just to those kids; it’s how we’re going to grow this economy over the long term.\nMR. LEHRER: We’re running out of time, gentlemen, so I think you have a chance to respond to that. Yes, Mr. Governor.\nTHE PRESIDENT: He has a chance.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Mr. President, you’re entitled, as the President, to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts, all right? I’m not going to cut education funding. I don’t have any plan to cut education funding and grants that go to people going to college. I’m planning on continuing to grow, so I’m not planning on making changes there.\nBut you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is. You put $90 billion into green jobs. And, look, I’m all in favor of green energy. Ninety billion -- that would have hired two million teachers. Ninety billion dollars. And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business. I think about half of them -- of the ones that have been invested in have gone out of business. A number of them happen to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.\nLook, the right course for America’s government -- we’re talking about the role of government -- is not to become the economic player picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world. The right answer for government is to say, how do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive?\nLet’s grade them. I propose we grade our schools, so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a school that’s being more successful. I don’t want to cut our commitment to education. I want to make it more effective and efficient.\nAnd by the way, I’ve had that experience. I don’t just talk about it. I’ve been there. Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didn’t have commitment to education. It’s because I care about education for all of our kids.\nMR. LEHRER: All right, gentlemen --\nTHE PRESIDENT: Jim, I --\nMR. LEHRER: Excuse me, one -- excuse me, sir. We’ve got -- we barely have three minutes left. I’m not going to grade the two of you and say your answers have been too long or I’ve done a poor job --\nTHE PRESIDENT: You’ve done a great job, Jim.\nMR. LEHRER: Oh, well, no. But the fact is government -- the role of government and governing -- we’ve lost a pod, in other words. So we only have three minutes left in the debate before we go to your closing statements. And so I want to ask, finally here -- and remember, we’ve got three minutes total time here. And the question is this: Many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock. If elected, in your case -- if reelected, in your case -- what would you do about that? Governor?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Jim, I had the great experience -- it didn’t seem like it at the time -- of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. And that meant I figured out -- from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done. We drove our schools to be number one in the nation. We cut taxes 19 times.\nMR. LEHRER: Well, what would you do as President?\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: As President, I will sit down on day one\n-- actually, the day after I get elected, I'll sit down with leaders, the Democrat leaders as well as Republican leaders, as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple of hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in our state, in that case. We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we're going to compromise our principles, but because there's common ground.\nAnd the challenges America faces right now -- look, the reason I'm in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country. We face -- this deficit could crush the future generations. What's happening in the Middle East -- there are developments around the world that are of real concern. And Republicans and Democrats both love America, but we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done, and could not care less if it's a Republican or a Democrat. I've done it before. I'll do it again.\nMR. LEHRER: Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney is going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them.\nBut, look, my philosophy has been I will take ideas from everybody -- Democrat or Republican -- as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class. That's how we cut taxes for middle-class families and small businesses. That's how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn't advancing that cause. That's how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world.\nThat's how we repealed \"don't ask, don't tell.\" That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised. And that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan. That's how we went after al Qaeda and bin Laden.\nSo we've seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives. But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do -- not just saying I'll sit down, you have to have a plan. Number two, what's important is occasionally you've got to say no to folks both in your own party and in the other party.\nAnd, yes, we had some fights between me and the Republicans when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street -- absolutely -- because that was a fight that needed to be had. When we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no -- yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.\nAnd so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things. And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.\nMR. LEHRER: That brings us to closing statements. There was a coin toss. Governor Romney, you won the toss and you elected to go last. So you have a closing two minutes, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, Jim, I want to thank you. And I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think this was a terrific debate and I very much appreciate it. And I want to thank the University of Denver.\nFour years ago, we were going through a major crisis. And, yet, my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished. And the reason is because of its people. Because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter, and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten. Because of a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn’t lay off workers during a recession. The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride that they’re helping to build America.\nAnd so the question now is, how do we build on those strengths? And everything that I’ve tried to do, and everything that I’m now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy, or making sure that we’re closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allow us to invest in our future -- all those things are designed to make sure that the American people -- their genius, their grit, their determination is channeled and they have an opportunity to succeed, and everybody is getting a fair shot and everybody is getting a fair share -- everybody is doing a fair share and everybody is playing by the same rules.\nFour years ago, I said that I’m not a perfect man and I wouldn’t be a perfect President. And that’s probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I’ve kept. But I also promised that I’d fight every single day on behalf of the American people and the middle class, and all those who are striving to get into the middle class. I’ve kept that promise. And if you’ll vote for me, then I promise I’ll fight just as hard in a second term.\nMR. LEHRER: Governor Romney, your two-minute closing.\nGOVERNOR ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President. And thank you for tuning in this evening.\nThis is an important election, and I’m concerned about America. I’m concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years. I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals. It’s bigger than our respective parties. It’s an election about the course of America -- what kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.\nAnd there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening. And over the course of this month we’re going to have two more presidential debates and a vice-presidential debate -- we’ll talk about those paths. But they lead in very different directions. And it’s not just looking to our words that you have to take into evidence of where they go; you can look at the record.\nThere’s no question in my mind that if the President were to be reelected you’ll continue to a see a middle-class squeeze, with incomes going down and prices going up. I’ll get incomes up again. You’ll see chronic unemployment. We’ve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent. If I’m President, I will create -- help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.\nIf the President is reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed. In my view, that’s going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past. Many will lose it. You’re going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family. If I’m elected, we won’t have Obamacare. We’ll put in place the kind of principles that I put in my place in my own state, and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured, and we’ll focus on getting the cost of health care down.\nIf the President were to be reelected, you’re going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare. You’ll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare advantage. You’ll have hospitals and providers that will no longer accept Medicare patients. I’ll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.\nAnd finally, military. If the President is reelected, you’ll see dramatic cuts to our military. The Secretary of Defense has said these would be even devastating. I will not cut our commitment to our military. I will keep America strong and get America’s middle class working again.\nThank you, Jim.\nMR. LEHRER: Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Mr. President.\nThe next debate will be the vice-presidential event on Thursday, October 11th, at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. For now, from the University of Denver, I’m Jim Lehrer. Thank you and good night. (Applause.)\nEND\n8:33 P.M.

Scott Walker's campaign even though groups under investigation had spent heavily to support him.\nProsser's letter to attorneys revealed two of the people caught up in the investigation had been involved in Prosser's 2011 re-election bid and had stressed the importance of finding donors for him.\nProsser wrote that outside spending to help him was \"very valuable to my campaign\" but did not rise to a level that would require him to step down from the challenge to the investigation of those groups. That's because the expenditures were made four years ago, at a time when there was no indication they would appear before the state's high court.\n\"The public ultimately decides at the ballot box who is permitted to serve on the Wisconsin Supreme Court,\" Prosser wrote. \"The special prosecutor seeks to prevent an elected justice from performing that service unless that unelected special prosecutor wants the elected justice to sit on the case. This is not the way the system works.\"\nProsser was part of a 4-2 majority that ruled this month that the probe into Walker's campaign must be ended and evidence prosecutors have obtained must be destroyed. It came three days after the GOP governor formally announced his bid for the presidency.\nSpecial prosecutor Francis Schmitz in February asked for Prosser and Justice Michael Gableman to recuse themselves from a trio of cases because groups under investigation had spent heavily to elect them. They both ruled against the investigation and the same day issued terse rulings saying they were not stepping aside.\nOn Wednesday, Prosser issued a 15-page letter explaining why he believed he could participate in the case. Gableman has not given a similar explanation.\nSchmitz had been investigating whether Walker's campaign illegally coordinated its activities with the Wisconsin Club for Growth and the political arm of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state's largest business lobby. The court ruled coordination with such groups is allowed because the campaign-style ads they run do not explicitly tell people how to vote.\nThe Wisconsin Club for Growth is estimated to have spent $507,000 for Gableman and $520,000 for Prosser. Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce spent an estimated $1.8 million for Gableman and $1.1 million for Prosser.\nIn addition, Citizens for a Strong America — a group funded entirely by the Wisconsin Club for Growth — spent an estimated $985,000 to help Prosser.\nThe probe into fundraising in 2011 and 2012 was conducted by Schmitz in conjunction with Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm and prosecutors from four other counties. Schmitz is a Republican and Chisholm is a Democrat.\nWalker and others have called the investigation a partisan witch hunt — a charge prosecutors deny.\nSchmitz declined to comment on Prosser's letter.\nIn explaining why he believed he could participate in the case, Prosser wrote at length about his 2011 re-election bid and the unusual campaign finance system that was in place at the time. Along the way, he accused the court's two liberals, Justices Shirley Abrahamson and Ann Walsh Bradley, of helping to lead \"a major effort to challenge my re-election.\"\nBradley denied that and said Prosser had engaged in \"revisionist history\" in his letter. Abrahamson was traveling Thursday and unavailable for comment.\nDemocrats who controlled state government in 2009 created a system for taxpayers to finance the campaigns of Supreme Court candidates. Republicans ended the program when they took control of state government, and Prosser's race was the only one conducted under that program.\nUnder it, candidates received $400,000 in public money by largely forgoing raising private donations. That system made heavy spending by outside groups \"inevitable\" and made candidates \"extremely vulnerable to third-party expenditures,\" Prosser wrote.\n\"While it can be argued that independent communications supporting my campaign were 'significant and disproportionate,' there was no alternative under Wisconsin law for people who believed I had done a good job and wanted me to continue,\" he wrote.\nTo qualify for public financing, candidates had to raise a total of $5,000 to $20,000 from at least 1,000 contributors. Prosser disclosed Schmitz had alleged two people caught up in the probe had been involved in his campaign.\n\"We need to do a quick conference call at 2PM tomorrow to discuss the Prosser race and his need for 1,000 low dollar donors by year end,\" read a November 2010 email, according to Prosser.\nProsser downplayed the significance of that email, writing that he was assisted by \"countless people\" who understood the importance of securing those donations.\nProsser did not name the people Schmitz had raised concerns about but said they were \"unnamed petitioners\" in the cases. Three petitioners anonymously brought challenges to the probe, and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported they were the Wisconsin Club for Growth, R.J. Johnson and Deb Jordahl.\nJohnson and Jordahl were advisers to the Wisconsin Club for Growth. Johnson was also an adviser to Walker's campaign at the time. Attorneys for Johnson and Jordahl did not comment Thursday.\nOne of the unnamed petitioners sent an email about the importance of raising money to maintain the court in 2011, according to Prosser.\n\"This and another quoted email are little more than evidence of the fact that some targets of the investigation (who had participated in other campaigns for the Supreme Court) engaged in expenditures that, under all the circumstances, were very valuable to my campaign,\" Prosser wrote.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in 2009 ruled heavy campaign spending in rare instances can require a judge to step aside from cases. In the case the nation's high court reviewed, a West Virginia coal company executive had spent $3 million to elect a state justice as his company was preparing to appeal a $50 million jury award against it.\nProsser wrote the circumstances were different for him because the spending benefiting him was made four years ago and there was no indication those spending money would wind up with cases before him in the foreseeable future.\n\"If my recusal were required now because of these expenditures ... the special prosecutor will have found a way to undermine judicial elections in Wisconsin,\" he wrote.\nAll Politics Blog\nFrom Madison and around the state, to Washington D.C., a daily dose of political news and glimpses behind the scenes.\nAdvertisement\nInside State Politics\nJournal Sentinel coverage of the legislature, governor's office and other state politics in Madison and around Wisconsin.\n- Paul Ryan renews criticism of ban on Muslim immigrants (21)\n- State, county veteran service officers resolve dispute (1)\n- Highway project delays rack up $700 million cost overruns (189)\n- On today's show: City-suburban crime, Clinton vs. Trump, millennials\n- Ron Johnson disagrees with Trump’s Muslim stance (30)\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Total special-interest spending through Tuesday, April 5, 2011: $3,581,460.\nGreater Wisconsin Committee (GWC) — $1,365,340.\nIssues Mobilization Council of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce (WMC) — $910,970.\nCitizens for a Strong America (CSA) — $836,090.\nWisconsin Club for Growth (CFG) — $415,860.\nState Tea Party Express — $53,200.\n---------------------------------------------------------------—\nWisconsin’s recent Supreme Court elections have featured costly multi-million dollar campaigns and vicious, mudslinging attack ads. Total TV spending in 2007 and 2008 races reached a staggering $6 million – more than quadruple previous years’ races – and in 2008, more money was spent on TV ads in Wisconsin than was spent in any other state (more than $3.8 million). In 2009, incumbent Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson raised $1,452,000 for her re-election campaign, narrowly breaking the previous fundraising record set just two years earlier by Justice Annette Ziegler. Special interests have also been active in Wisconsin judicial elections; most recently, the Greater Wisconsin Committee spent about $306,000 in Justice Abrahamson’s 2009 campaign.\nRecent elections have featured hard-hitting attack ads. One particularly controversial ad aired by Justice Mike Gableman in his 2008 campaign attacked incumbent Justice Louis Butler for allegedly coddling criminals. Numerous misleading statements in the advertisement led to ethics charges against Gableman, though the proceeding ended inconclusively in 2010 when the remaining members of the Supreme Court deadlocked on whether to sanction Gableman.\nIn the wake of substantial negative press and concerns about the increasing influence of politics and special interest money in judicial elections, the state legislature passed Wisconsin’s public financing law in 2009. 2011 was the state’s first high court election with public financing.\nThe 2011 election kicked off with four candidates competing in a February 15th primary. Three of the four candidates – incumbent David Prosser and challengers Joel Winnig and JoAnne Kloppenburg – opted into the public funding program, which provided $100,000 to each candidate for the primary campaign. The fourth candidate, Marla Stephens, did not seek public financing.\nBoth publicly funded challengers ran TV ads during the primary campaign; the privately financed candidate, Stephens, did not buy any TV airtime. Incumbent David Prosser benefitted from more than $400,000 in ad purchases by the conservative group Wisconsin Club for Growth.\nThrough the primary election, more than half a million dollars – $591,000 – was spent overall on TV air time. Club for Growth, spending approximately $408,000, accounted for about 69 percent of all television advertising in the primary. It spent more than twice as much for ads supporting Prosser than was spent on TV by the incumbent’s challengers combined. Club for Growth didn’t only ring up a higher total than the challengers, it paid more per advertisement. Club for Growth paid an average of about $400 for each of its ads, while Winnig paid less than $200 per ad, and Kloppenburg less than $150 per ad—indicating that Club for Growth’s ads were disproportionately placed in larger markets or during programming with larger audiences than the ads placed by Prosser’s challengers.\nProsser handily won the primary, and Kloppenburg placed second. The two candidates went on to face off in the April 5th general election. Both received a base grant of $300,000 in public funds for the general election campaign.\nFollowing the primary, many observers assumed Prosser would easily coast to victory in the general election, but outside political events transformed the race into a heated, highly competitive contest. Governor Scott Walker’s push to change the state’s collective bargaining provisions, a move that sparked weeks of protests at the state Capitol, energized the Supreme Court election. Since the protests, interest in the race soared as liberal-leaning organizations attacked Prosser as a “rubber stamp” for Walker, and business groups warned that a Kloppenburg victory could endanger Walker’s legislative accomplishments if and when the Supreme Court ruled on challenges to the legislation. Special interest groups on both sides poured money into TV ad buys through Election Day. Special interest groups spent just under $3.6 million on television ads, while overall spending in the state reached nearly $5 million.\nProsser narrowly won the race, maintaining the court’s conservative majority.\nReturn to Buying Time Homepage\nReal Time Analysis\nThroughout the election season the Brennan Center issued a series of analyses focused on judicial election spending\nAdvertisements\nApril 2, 2011 – Prosser vs. Kloppenberg 2\nStream Video QT | Download storyboard here\nAn advertisement by the Wisconsin Tea Party Express says respected legal experts agree that Justice Prosser is a great judge.\nApril 2, 2011 – Prosser vs. Kloppenberg\nStream Video QT | Download storyboard here\nAn advertisement by the Wisconsin Tea Party Express says respected legal experts agree that Justice Prosser is a great judge.\nApril 2, 2011 – Sexist Slurs\nStream Video QT | Download storyboard here\nAn advertisement by the Greater Wisconsin Committee says Justice David Prosser used a sexist slur toward his colleague.\nApril 2, 2011 – Refused\nStream Video QT | Download storyboard here\nAn advertisement by Citizens for a Stronger America says JoAnne Kloppenberg refused to stop misleading ads aired by her allies.\nApril 1, 2011 – Law and Order 2\nStream Video QT | Download storyboard here\nAn advertisement by the Wisconsin Glub for Growth states that Prosser guards children against crime.\nApril 1, 2011 – Prosser Supports Walker\nStream Video QT | Download storyboard here\nAn advertisement by the Greater Wisconsin Committee claims that Prosser voted to restrict collective bargaining rights.\nMarch 30, 2011 – Tough on Crime\nStream Video QT | Download storyboard here\nAn advertisement by the Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce Issues Mobilization Council says JoAnne Kloppenburg is weak on criminals.\nMarch 30, 2011 – Courtroom Experience\nStream Video QT | Download storyboard here\nAn advertisement by Citizens for a Stronger America attacks Kloppenburg for her lack of courtroom experience.\nPolice for Prosser\nAn advertisement by Prosser’s campaign says that Prosser votes to protect law enforcement.*\n*This ad is no longer available online\nDesperate Lies\nAn advertisement by Prosser’s campaign says the advertisement attacking Prosser for a 30 year old sexual assault case is “sleazy and full of lies.”*\n*This ad is no longer available online\nProsser a Healthy Choice\nAn advertisement by Prosser’s campaign says Justice Prosser’s leadership provides for injured patients and keeps down health care costs.*\n*This ad is no longer available online\nMarch 24, 2011 – Justice Blind\nStream Video QT | Download storyboard here\nJoAnne Kloppenburg says that as a Supreme Court Justice she will ensure that “justice is blind.”\nMarch 24, 2011 – Refuses to Prosecute\nStream Video QT | Download storyboard here\nAn advertisement by the Greater Wisconsin Committee claims that Prosser refuses to prosecute a priest for sexual abuse.\nMarch 23, 2011 – Law and Order\nStream Video QT | Download storyboard here\nAn advertisement by the Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce Issues Mobilization Council says Justice Prosser protects Wisconsin families.\nMarch 18, 2011 – Rubber Stamp\nStream Video QT | Download storyboard here\nAn advertisement by the Greater Wisconsin Committee claims Justice Prosser is a rubber stamp for Governor Scott Walker.\nFebruary, 2011 – Justice David Prosser\nA Youtube advertisement by David Prosser’s campaign touts his experience.*\n*This ad is no longer available online\nFebruary 8, 2011 – Difference\nStream Video QT | Download storyboard here\nAn advertisement by Joel Winnig’s campaign states he represents independence, integrity and justice.\nFebruary 7, 2011 – Crossroads\nStream Video QT | Download storyboard here\nAn advertisement by Joel Winnig’s campaign states he is the independent candidate who will restore integrity to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\nFebruary 7, 2011 – Prosser Understands\nStream Video QT | Download storyboard here\nAn advertisement by the Wisconsin Club for Growth states that Prosser is tough on crime.\nJanuary 26, 2011 – Ralph Cagle\nStream Video QT | Download storyboard here\nIn a JoAnne Kloppenburg advertisement, citizen’s describe her as independent and tough.\nNews\nTea Party, Labor Spend Big In Wis.

The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:09 a.m. in room 2172, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Edward Royce (chairman of the committee) presiding. Chairman Royce. This hearing will come to order. Iran and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have really been on a roll, and that is the subject of this hearing today. And I want to thank our witnesses for being with us. Let me start by just giving my observations on recent events. So over the last few weeks, the IRGC has tested a new long-range ballistic missile, and that test is in violation of the U.N. sanctions. They also released a video of dozens more of these ICBMs staged in an underground bunker. The IRGC Quds Force has stepped up efforts in support of the murderous Assad regime in Syria, and we have seen those attacks on the ground. And by all accounts it appears that the IRGC has prevented international investigators from assessing the information needed to conclusively finish a report on the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program. It is on IRGC territory, so. From nuclear proliferation to support of international terrorism, to human rights abuses, the IRGC has made Iran the global menace that Iran is today. The IRGC is responsible for squashing democracy movements at home, for spreading the Iranian regime's revolutionary ideology abroad, and for sparking turmoil throughout the Middle East. Its forces operate again, independent of Iran's regular army. It answers directly only to one man, Iran's Supreme Leader. While most understand the role of the IRGC in fueling conflict throughout the region, its hidden grasp on the Iranian economy is just as important. People don't realize that most of the major businesses were nationalized basically and turned over to the IRGC to control. So they have about 30 percent of the Iranian economy. The IRGC has been labeled Iran's ``most powerful economic actor'' by the U.S. Treasury Department, which has noted its deep reach into ``critical sectors of Iran's economic infrastructure.'' The IRGC's biggest, largest entity is this construction arm which controls 800 affiliated companies. That it also controls billions of assets, is often I think lost, on the public here. The fact that much of the money that is held in escrow that when released is going to flow through the IRGC, I think that point has been lost on us. These activities in turn fund Iran's ballistic missile program, its military activities, its regional aggression. Of course none of this appears to disqualify Iran from receiving sanctions relief under a nuclear deal that allows Iran to keep a path to a weapon. Within months Iran could have access to tens of billions in new cash as this money comes out of escrow. And this, what I call a ``stimulus package,'' this stimulus package for the Supreme Leader will only strengthen the IRGC. And as trade restrictions with Iran loosens, that in turn of course, will increase its access to dual-use technology for its military and its missile programs. An IRGC with more cash means more threats to the United States and our allies. Even when Iran's sanctions were fully in place, Iran's support to the Assad regime in Syria totaled every year $6 billion. I am going to guess now that that is going to go up. IRGC support on the ground, combined with Russian air support, worsened the already horrible conflict in Syria, drawing in foreign fighters and giving ISIS room to grow. And more resources for the IRGC also promises to create problems in Iraq, and in Yemen--where the guards are backing Shia militias responsible for violence against Iraq's Sunni minority and against the Houthi rebels fighting Saudi forces in Yemen. This combined with Iran's continued support for terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas--and I will just remind people that the other story that surfaced a few months ago, was that the IRGC will now try to transfer--and I think this is in direct violation of the agreement--try to transfer guidance systems, GPS guidance systems, to the 90,000 rockets and missiles that are already in Hezbollah's inventory, and has also offered to resupply the inventory that Hamas spent in the Gaza war and rebuild the tunnels to boot. So, the major source of instability in that region is the IRGC. In selling its flawed nuclear deal to Congress, I believe Secretary Kerry testified, that there would be no let up on Iran's terror and destructive regional behavior. That was my takeaway as I listened to his words, but I want to now understand how that is going to be followed with action. We have yet to see any effective strategy from the administration to pushback against IRGC's regional advances which have emboldened Iran, which have undermined our allies, and this morning we will hear from our witnesses on what such a strategy might look like, and how Congress can help. And I will now turn to the ranking member for any opening comments he may have. Mr. Engel. Mr. Engel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for calling this hearing, and I want to welcome all witnesses to the Foreign Affairs Committee. In the wake of the Paris attacks, the world is focused on the fight against ISIS, and announcements yesterday by the Secretary of Defense, about new measures that we are taking to fight ISIS are welcome, and I think that there is obviously a lot more to go. We are reminded of the ongoing threat posed by terrorism, and so I am glad our committee is focusing on the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, Iran. I want to echo the concerns the chairman just mentioned, the fact that Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism. And in the past several years when Iran had no money, it still found money to be the leading state sponsor of terrorism. Under the deal negotiated with Iran, they will be awash in cash. They will have lots of money, and imagine how much destruction they can do in support of terrorist activities and terrorism. That is very deeply troubling to me, and it was and has been throughout our discussions about U.S. relations with Iran and the entire nuclear deal with Iran. Now, since ceding power in 1979, the Iranian regime has built an ugly record supporting terrorist proxies. Let's remember this: The seizure of our Embassy in Tehran 1979, the bombings of our Embassy in the Marines barracks in Beirut in the early 1980s, killing nearly 300 Americans, the attacks in Buenos Aires that targeted Israel's Embassy and a Jewish community center, the Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, which also cost American lives, and just a few years ago, a plot to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador right here in Washington. And every one of these horrible events is covered in Iran's fingerprints. The Iranian regime uses the Quds Force, an elite unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as a tool to support terrorist proxies and spread instability throughout the region. And in recent years, Iran's leaders have doubled down on this reprehensible policy, and let's just look at what is going on today. In Syria, Iran is committed to propping up the Assad regime and now is working with Putin in pursuit of that objective. So much for P5+1. It has mobilized Hezbollah and organized militias composed of Shi'ite fighters from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan to support the regime. It has also deployed hundreds if not thousands of the Quds Force fighters in a direct combat roll. And the result of Iran's actions, a longer, more costly war, a graver humanitarian crisis, and more and more innocent lives lost. In Iraq, the Quds Force continues to support hard-core Shia militias, some of which were involved in targeting American troops during the Iraq war. These violent groups drive sectarian division, making it harder to build the inclusive Iraqi Government necessary to help defeat ISIS. And in Yemen, Iran's support for Houthi rebels has fomented a bloody civil war that is now spilling over Yemen's borders. Chaos in that country has hampered U.S. counterterrorism efforts, focused on AQAP, one of the most dangerous Al Qaeda affiliates. Iran also supports Shi'ite elements in other Gulf states, including Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, that are involved in efforts to destabilize those governments. And, of course, the Iranian regime has repeatedly expressed its support for wiping Israel off the map. By providing a steady flow of missiles to Hezbollah and arms to Hamas, Iran is a grave threat to our close ally Israel. Finally, it is important to note that Iran's support for terrorism is not just limited to the Middle East. Just this past week Kenyan security forces arrested two men suspected of working with the Quds Force to plan attacks in that East African nation. This dangerous pattern is one of the reasons I remain concerned about the Iran nuclear deal. Once the nuclear sanctions on Iran are lifted, the regime will have access to tens of billions of dollars in new wealth, and I will bet my money that some of it will end up in terrorist coffers. So I agree with what the chairman said: Iran was a leading and has been a leading state sponsor of terrorism when they had no money. Imagine now when they are going to have sanctions lifted, how much money they have which will directly go to terrorist activities. So in my view, these factors all point to the likelihood of greater case and instability in the years ahead. So today I hope we can discuss what can be done to counter Iran's maligned activities in the region beyond. I want to mention just a few areas I think are most important. First, we must aggressively enforce terrorism, proliferation, and human rights sanctions on Iran. This includes existing sanctions on the IRGC, and we should continue to designate all entities connected to Iran's support for terrorism. We need to send a clear message that working with Iranian firms linked to the IRGC is risky business. Next, we need to keep making our case to our EU allies and others that Hezbollah as an organization, not just its military wing, is a terrorist organization and should be treated like a terrorist organization. Our friends in Europe try to split hairs by saying that only part of Hamas is a terrorist organization. The other part is a humanitarian organization. Baloney. It is a terrorist organization, and we should say it, and our allies should say it. We should ramp up our efforts to track the resources Iran receives as a result of sanctions relief. We need to know just how much money Iran is funneling to these violent groups. We need final closer cooperation with our Gulf allies on defense intelligence, counterterrorism, maritime security, and other key areas. And, lastly, we need to maintain a very close security relationship with Israel, our closest ally in the region. This includes the negotiation of a new memorandum of understanding, or MOU, that reflects the new security environment in the region. We must also redouble our commitment to supporting missile defense systems, including Iron Dome, so that Israel is able to defend itself. And I hope going forward Congress and the administration do what is needed to pursue those aims. I look forward to ideas and insight from our witnesses, and I yield back. Chairman Royce. Thank you, Mr. Engel. So this morning we are joined by a distinguished panel. We have Mr. Ali Alfoneh. He is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. He is an expert on civil military relations in Iran as well as the author of ``Iran Unveiled: How the Revolutionary Guard is Transforming Iran from a Theocracy into a Military Dictatorship.'' Mr. Scott Modell is managing director of the Rapidan Group, and prior to this he served at the Central Intelligence Agency where he conducted operations throughout the Middle East, including as part of the post-9/11 operations in Afghanistan. And we have Ambassador Daniel Benjamin with us. He is the Norman E. McCulloch director at Dartmouth College. Previously Ambassador Benjamin served as the Ambassador-at-Large and Coordinator for Counterterrorism where he was the principal advisor on counterterrorism to Secretary of State Clinton. And we welcome our panel. Without objection, the witnesses' full prepared statement will be made part of the record here. And members will have 5 days to submit statements or questions or any extraneous materials for the record. And Mr. Alfoneh, please summarize your remarks. STATEMENT OF MR. ALI ALFONEH, SENIOR FELLOW, FOUNDATION FOR DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACIES Mr. Alfoneh. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Engel. Thank you very much for your kind invitation, and thank you for providing me with the opportunity to share my analysis with you, along with the members of this distinguished panel. You mentioned, sir, the Iranian revolution of 1979 as a historical event of the past, and that is, indeed, the American perception of the revolution. In Iran, however, the leaders of the Islamic Republic, they subscribe to Trotsky's theory of a permanent revolution. For them the revolution of 1979, is not a historical event of the past which took place and is over. From their perspective, the revolution is permanent, is happening every single day, and the engine of that revolution, Mr. Chairman, is the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. This is also why I do not share the optimism of some of my colleagues here in Washington who believe that the emergence of President Rouhani, his promise of engaging in bilateral talks with the U.S., the nuclear negotiations and the deal which was negotiated, and even emergence of a common threat of Islamic State, is going to make life easier in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Because of the very simple reason that President Rouhani and his technocratic government, they are not in charge of the portfolios which are of interest to us today. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps is in control of Iran's regional policies. Let's take a quick look at the problems that I see. First of all, as the chairman and the ranking member pointed out, the Revolutionary Guard not only is in control of the policy, they have also benefitted most financially from the nuclear deal. Much of the money which the Government of the Islamic Republic has received is going to be channeled to companies owned by the Revolutionary Guards, or directly to the military budget of the Revolutionary Guards. Apart from this, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard is pursuing policy objectives in the Middle East region which are in contrast and totally opposed to U.S. objectives. The United States desires to see a future of Syria in which Bashar al-Assad, who is personally responsible for destruction of his own country, does not play a role. The Revolutionary Guard's goal is to keep Bashar al-Assad in power, and to that effect they are trying to mobilize, and they have managed to mobilize, a pan-Shi'ite international brigade to Syria, and that deployment of course is increasing the risk of spread of the conflict in Syria to other countries. The home countries of those militia men, which is primarily Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, and even distant and geographically far away Pakistan. The United States desires to fight ISIL. That is not the case with the Revolutionary Guards. From their perspective, it is fine that there is an enemy called the Islamic State. Which is not really threatening the existence of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and at the same time, is the only alternative to Bashar al-Assad and his dictatorial regime in Syria. This is why we see that the Iranian forces and unfortunately also the Russian forces in Syria, are not targeting the ISIL threats. They are targeting the secular opposition to Mr. Assad. We also see that these mechanisms are perpetuating the war in Syria. Because of the exact presence of the Revolutionary Guards in Syria, we see more and more Sunni radicals from all over the world travelling to Syria to fight the Shia threat, and to counter it, and this is, of course, something which is perpetuating the conflict and keeping ISIL, in its existence, it is prolonging the existence of ISIS. So some of the policies which I believe the United States could apply in order to counter those measures is first and foremost to attack those units of the Revolutionary Guards which were deployed to Syria by designations. Those groups of the Revolutionary Guards, they are engaged in support to Mr. Assad's regime. They are engaged in terrorist activities, and they should be designated as such. And also I believe that the United States should never accept demands of the Islamic Republic of Iran or others that Mr. Bashar al-Assad should be kept in power in Syria because that would only serve the interests of the Revolutionary Guards. And will perpetuate not only the war in Syria, but also the revolution, the permanent revolution which I mentioned in the beginning of this presentation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Alfoneh follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] ---------- STATEMENT OF MR. SCOTT MODELL, MANAGING DIRECTOR, THE RAPIDAN GROUP Mr. Modell. Chairman Royce, Ranking Member Engel, members of the committee, fellow panelists, good morning. Thank you for the opportunity to speak today. As the Middle East continues to burn, the U.S. and its allies have numerous reasons to believe that Iran really hasn't changed all that much since President Rouhani took office in September 2013. President Rouhani was elected to rescue Iran's economy. That was his mandate, and he is on his way to achieving that. Rouhani may appear moderate next to outspoken hardliners in the IRGC, but I believe that both continue to be driven by the same revolutionary ideals that inspired the Ayatollah Khomeini to create the Islamic Republic in 1979. Rouhani has been outspoken in his disagreement with some of the methods chosen by the IRGC, but there is little that he can do, as Mr. Alfoneh has said, to stop the IRGC. The recent unwillingness of the Obama administration to weaken the IRGC seems to me incompatible with its apparent belief that the JCPOA will strengthen moderates in Iran who favor internal reform and rapprochement with the West. I think it is worth it to look at some of the core missions of the IRGC, particularly it is Quds Force in the region, some of which are not regularly mentioned, others which were mentioned by the chairman and the ranking member. In addition to some of the lethal activities that were suggested and the more destabilizing military activities that the IRGC engages in, they are heavily involved in covert influence, grass roots foundation building across the region, via culture, socioeconomic, political, and business organizations, and in my testimony I have given a graphic of some of the ways in which they approach the whole of government, grass roots, bottom-up approach to building influence across countries, which is sectarian driven. The IRGC is also working very closely with Lebanese Hezbollah to build a global commercial apparatus that is designed to acquire new technologies, assist with covert action programs, create new sources of revenue, and actually add to Iran's existing threat facilitation networks. The importance of covert action to Iran's revolutionary export strategy has been clear from day one, particularly in the last 4 years. Since May 11, there have been dozens of terrorist plots attributed to Iran, from an attempt to murder the Saudi Ambassador in the U.S., to a foiled bomb plot in Kenya, covert action continues to remain a key tool of Iranian foreign policy. The Quds Force is engaged in various nonkinetic activities, as I said, and they will continue to play a role in its external resistance mission, whether it is front companies religious foundations, cultural centers, and so on. Some of the ways in which IRGC is destabilizing the region have already been mentioned. I would like to point out a couple of things that are given less attention I think, and that is the IRGC is part of a sectarian repopulation strategy across the region. Few people are talking about the IRGC's leading role in Iran's strategy to alter the sectarian balance across the region, beginning in the Levant. So when and where it can, Iran-sponsored militias are creating Shia support bases across Iraq and Syria and even getting to the point of pressuring Sunni's entire communities to relocate. It perpetuates Sunni distrust, hatred, and organized opposition to Iran, Iran-backed militias, and even Shiites. Bahrain is mentioned also. I think it is a particular problem. The propaganda war between Manama and Tehran continues to intensify as a result of persistent messaging on the part of Iranian hardliners that Bahrain actually belongs to Iran. The recent arrest of 36 Bahraini Shiites on charges of spying for the IRGC, the 400 or so others in prison on similar charges, and the dozens of incidents over the years, almost always lead back to the IRGC. In Saudi Arabia while President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif have made some attempt at diplomatic outreach to the Saudis, the IRGC has been on a much more confrontational path, both openly and covertly. Saudi Government continues to uncover IRGC attempts to penetrate and militarize Shia communities in its oil-rich eastern province. The IRGC's Department 1000 operating out of Basrah continues to play a key role in these and other efforts against the Kingdom. I look forward to talking about some of my policy recommendations as well. Thank you for the opportunity. [The prepared statement of Mr. Modell follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] ---------- Chairman Royce. Thank you. Ambassador. STATEMENT OF MR. DANIEL BENJAMIN, NORMAN E. MCCULLOCH JR. DIRECTOR, THE JOHN SLOAN DICKEY CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING, DARTMOUTH COLLEGE (FORMER AMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE AND COORDINATOR FOR COUNTERTERRORISM, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE) Ambassador Benjamin. Chairman Royce, Ranking Member Engel, distinguished members of the committee, thank you very much for the opportunity to speak today about Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, and more broadly, the country's destabilizing behavior in the Middle East. As a prefatory note though, I want to mention that the United States has over recent decades compiled a record of success in dealing with Iran. We have certainly had our losses, such as at Khobar Towers in Beirut in 1983, but overall our Nation has, together with our partners in the region and around the world, prevented the Islamic Republic from causing far greater damage to regional stability and the security of some of our closest friends. And today I am convinced that we are on a course to continue the success and, indeed, to strengthen security in the region through the JCPOA, which if Iran fulfills its obligations, will end the country's pursuit of a nuclear weapon for at least 15 years. As President Obama has said on many occasions, this deal does not address all of Iran's behavior, nor was it intended to, but it does address one of the foremost security challenges of our time, and that is Iran's nuclear aspirations. And as we consider the other ways in which Iran challenges us, we should be mindful of the JCPOA achievement and leery of anything that would undermine it, and we should also recognize that, the problems we face would be, without the JCPOA, far more problematic if we were facing off against a nuclear-armed Iran. The charge has been made that Iran is going to get a vast influx of cash with which to carry out terrorist attacks and subversion. We certainly have well-founded fears of Iranian plotting, and we must continue to show vigilance, but the argument I think needs to be examined in two ways. First, how likely is it that Iran will devote massive resources to such a course, and second, to what extent does the Islamic Republic's behavior, current behavior, represent a continuation of earlier conduct. It seems to me that the hypothesis is flawed in two ways--In several ways excuse me. First, the Iranian leadership's goal in negotiating the JCPOA was to improve economic conditions at home that were eroding support for the regime. So much seems clear from the rhetoric and the behavior of Iran's leaders. It would follow, therefore, that the bulk of the money will be used to ameliorate domestic concerns. According to press reports, the U.S. intelligence community has arrived at the same conclusion. And I would add here that Iran usually makes rational calculations about advancing its interests, and having invested the time, energy, and political capital in the JCPOA, it is undoubtedly aware that a new and enhanced campaign of terrorism or subversion would risk scuttling the agreement. Second, as has been mentioned before, the country has never restricted resources for its foreign policy, especially not for such activities as its direct support to the Assad regime and Iranian fighting in Syria. I think that suggests that it considers those areas to be well-funded. It is unlikely to spend vast new sums. It will certainly continue pouring money into those activities, but it is also important to remember that terrorism and subversion are inexpensive activities, and we have learned that through hard experience. Iran, of course, remains by significant margin the foremost state sponsor of terrorism, and we have seen no indication that there has been any change in the belief that terrorism is a legitimate instrument of policy. But what I would like to note is that, to pick up on what Mr. Modell was saying, you know, the sectarian dimension of all this requires an awful lot of attention, and I would suggest that the situation that we confront today is far different from one that we have seen in the past. And I think it is one we really need to examine closely. Whether we are talking about what is going on in Yemen, in Bahrain, in Syria, these reflect dynamics in the region that have changed dramatically. And it is important to recognize also that the trigger for sharpening in revival of sectarian tensions was our invasion of Iraq, which destroyed the region's fragile equilibrium and upended the regional politics. And the second trigger was the Arab Spring, which opened up a new opportunity in Syria for Sunnis to even the score having lost the capital in Baghdad. There is a lot more to say, but I want to just close my remarks by saying that I don't think there is any expectation that Iran is going to be a good global citizen, but I think that the United States is well postured to deter and to prevent increased subversive and terrorist actions through a raft of different sanctions regimes, both as well as U.N. Security Council resolutions that enable all kinds of actions to constrain Iran, and I think that we are in a good position to manage the problems that we face. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Ambassador Benjamin follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] ---------- Chairman Royce. Let me go to a question that I think impacted all of us back in October. October 15 you had the missile launch, the most advanced missile yet in the IRGC's inventory, and 2 months later there has still been no action in the wake of that test, which I think clearly violated United Nations Security Council Resolution 2331. So Mr. Modell, if I could ask you here, about next steps, because given that the EU sanctions are going to be lifted against the traditional home of their ballistic missile programs, which is the IRGC Air Force at their Ghadar missile command, what are the chances that the administration will actually implement sanctions against Iran for this advancement in its ballistic missile program? Mr. Modell. I don't see any indications that there is a good chance that the Obama administration is going to take any punitive actions with regard to this ballistic missile launch. It was clearly in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 and the updated resolution as you said. I think it is worth pointing out that the IRGC's aerospace force has not gotten a lot of attention when you look at the IRGC's role in externalizing this revolution throughout the region. And if you look at the development of Iran's missiles, it has been a key part of their conventional military buildup over the last 20 years, particularly since the end of the Iran-Iraq war. They believe it goes hand in hand with their idea of self- sufficiency in promoting the revolution. And I think when you look at the pace at which they are developing new missiles, the pace at which they are trying to use precision-guided technology, not only in the missiles that you mentioned that are going into the hands of Hezbollah and Palestinians, it could be used against Israel but throughout the region, I think it is something that needs to be addressed. And I---- Chairman Royce. Let me change directions then, because obviously with the IRGC being the most probable economic actor in the equation there in the government in Iran, what is the risk of any company looking at reentering the Iranian market, from major Asian firms in Japan or in South Korea with U.S. exposure to small companies in eastern Germany? What is the risk of doing business with the IRGC? Mr. Modell. One of the things I would say, I am glad it was mentioned that companies going back, particularly the European companies going back into Iran, should be well advised to look at the fact that the IRGC is not going away, and the IRGC has deeply penetrated every corner of every industry in Iran for the most part. And I think that one of the things that needs to be talked more about is the fact that IRGC-linked companies and businesses have already started the process of hiding their IRGC links in anticipation of trying to get into business deals with European companies and Asian companies and others who are going to be reentering Iran. There is a process underway, among IRGC individuals and entities, that are sanctioned, to ensconce themselves in companies that are clean, in business deals that are clean, so that means erasing old contracts, erasing records and business registries, and different things. So I think it is a very dangerous proposition for any company going back into Iran not knowing exactly who they are going to be dealing with. The other issue, Mr. Chairman, that I would mention is over the last decade, you have seen a terrible problem in the growth of corruption in Iran. So if you believe that the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act should be any deterrent for companies going back in, again, Oil Minister Zanganeh 2 days ago, at the launch of a global meeting, to talk about the reemergence of the Iran's oil and gas industry, had to go out of his way to say any companies doing business with Iran who are asked to pay bribes, those contracts will be null and void. He had to go out of his way because it is a tremendous problem, and the IRGC is at the heart of that problem. So, what I would advise companies going back into Iran, one thing, what has emerged is there are a number of data analytic firms here in DC and elsewhere that are specializing in due diligence, so the idea of enhanced, know-your-customer measures that will need to be taken for anybody going back into Iran will require outside support. Chairman Royce. Let me ask Mr. Alfoneh the last question here, and that goes to the two goals that you talked about in your testimony that they are seeking in Iran. First, they are working to keep Bashar al-Assad in power by coordinating Shi'ite militias to maintain control over western Syria. By the way, I would add to that something that Mr. Modell mentioned in his testimony, but I have been briefed on the fact that they are even bringing in militia from Hezbollah and their families into Sunni-dominated neighborhoods in Damascus and running the Sunni population out as they basically do an ethnic cleansing campaign. But that is part of it. And secondarily, you said they are combatting secular opposition in Syria while maintaining ISIS is a worse alternative to al-Assad. Can you explain how the IRGC is accomplishing that dual mission? Mr. Alfoneh. Yes, Mr. Chairman. If we look at the combat fatalities of the Revolutionary Guards in Syria, we see that the place of death is usually the places which have been bombed by the Russian Air Force, so in other words, the Revolutionary Guard is in practice acting at the infantry force, the ground force, of Russia. And we also know from U.S. Government sources that Russia is not bombing the Islamic State. Russia is bombing the secular opposition to Bashar al-Assad's regime, and then after Russia has bombed those specific areas, we see an influx of Revolutionary Guards members going into those areas, and also the place of death is reported in those exact areas. So unfortunately, this is a very, very cynical strategy that the Assad regime and the Revolutionary Guards are pursuing in combination. Concerning your comment about the role of the Revolutionary Guards and the economy, Mr. Modell is absolutely right. If you look at the assets of the Revolutionary Guards on Tehran's stock exchange, it is more than $17 billion worth of companies registered on Tehran's stock exchange that the Revolutionary Guard has purchased during the time that the government of President Ahmadinejad was privatizing these companies. So the Revolutionary Guards' claims that its front companies are private sector actors and they do not belong to the public sector. This is why they were allowed to bid for ownership of those companies, and they acquired, they purchased those companies on Tehran's stock exchange. Just to mention one example, Iran Telecommunication, which is the largest phone company in Iran, was purchased by the Revolutionary Guards in 2009 for $7 billion. Back then in 2009, the military budget of the Revolutionary Guards on an annual basis was only $5 billion, but they could pay for the company, the phone company, $7 billion cash because of all the other economic activities that they have. Chairman Royce. I assume that makes it easier for the IRGC to monitor citizens' communications as well. We will go to Mr. Engel. Mr. Engel. Thank you. Thank you very much, and thank you for your excellent testimony. Ambassador Benjamin, I agree with you when you said that the invasion of Iraq really changed, upset the apple cart, and really in hindsight, we eliminated Iran's major adversary. Therefore, we helped unfortunately to make Iran the hegemony power in the region, and I think that is very, very true. But I couldn't disagree with you more when you say that the fact that Iran has been the leading state sponsor of terrorism when they had no money doesn't necessarily mean that now that they have money, they will continue or increase their terrorist activities. I think that logic says that if the goal of the Iranian regime, the Revolutionary Guards and the entire regime, is to sponsor terrorism to destabilize the region, now that they have money and it is not going to be a sacrifice, they are going to use it for terrorism. When the Rial, their currency was in the toilet, when their people clamored for more freedoms or more things that they needed, Iran, the government, the regime didn't care. The regime made sure, though, that groups like Hezbollah and even Hamas, which of course is the other side of the Sunni-Shia spectrum, had enough money. So now that Iran has money and it is not going to be so painful, I think that it is very easy to imagine, and it is not imagination, that they will have more money to support more terrorism. And finally, you had mentioned the Security Council resolutions. I don't think that Iran cares about Security Council resolutions. They had a resolution had been passed at a Security Council which demanded, I think there were six or seven or five resolutions that Iran stop spinning centrifuges, that Iran stop spinning. And one of the problems I had with the negotiations with Iran is that we didn't make a precondition of our sitting down with them and talking with them that they stop spinning. And once we didn't demand that as a prerequisite to sit down with them, you knew that in the conclusion of any agreement we had with them, the demand that they stop spinning, as the Security Council resolution said, would not be a final decision in any kind of agreement. So I think we essentially ceded that. I just want to mention this because Members here are very thoughtful, and some voted no, and some voted yes. I voted no. I respect every Member's thoughtfulness. But I think that what really bothers me is I think that we have almost stamped the fact that the Iranian regime is going to be there for a long time to come. We have helped them. We have given them all kinds of relief, and any hope we had of regime change so the Iranian people could live in a democracy I think, went out the window because frankly regimes that have lots of money are able to use it. So I just wanted to point that out, and if you care to answer, I would be grateful. Ambassador Benjamin. Mr. Engel, you have put a lot of issues on the table. Let me just try to answer a few of them quickly. You mentioned your skepticism about Security Council resolutions. Well, the issue is not what Iran thinks of them. It is that they empower the international community to take certain actions. And so for example, at the end of September, a weapons system from Iran to Yemen was seized on the high seas under the provisions of the relevant Security Council resolution. So the point is we can have an effect, a real material, concrete effect on Iran's ability to play the kind of role that everyone here deplores because of those instruments. You mentioned the money issue. So I think that there is a few things to say. One is that there is basically an absorption issue. There is just not that many different things to spend the money on. They have been spending lots of money on these activities for a long time. They will pour more in. I expect to see that more resources will make their way in particular to Syria. And by the way, although we all deplore what is going on in Syria, I think it is important to remember that Iran's policy there is fundamentally a conservative one. They are trying to preserve the status quo. Trying to preserve their one important ally in the international community. And---- Mr. Engel. I might say---- Ambassador Benjamin. I am sorry? Mr. Engel. I might say they are trying to preserve it, and in trying to preserve it, they are using the terrorist group Hezbollah to do the fighting and to guarantee that they can preserve it, so that is another element of support for---- Ambassador Benjamin. Without a doubt, and they have been funding Hezbollah for many, many years, and I don't dispute that in any way. I am just saying that, first of all, one of the main constraints has been manpower and not money, and, you know, you don't need $50 billion to fund your terrorism or subversive activities. I do find it hard to imagine why Iran would make a quantum leap in its provocative behavior if that would throw into doubt the future of the agreement that they worked so hard to get. I think that the Iranian leadership definitely saw that their position was eroding as a result of public discontent. And so I think that those resources will primarily, although not exclusively, go to ameliorate social conditions and to restart the economy. I would just also point out, because several people have mentioned Hamas, that Hamas has been essentially cut off by Iran because Hamas refused to support Iran's policy toward Syria. And I think that this is an absolutely perfect illustration of how the sectarian upheaval in the region has changed the rules of the game. And we should remember that King Salman, the new king of Saudi Arabia, didn't find time to come to the United States for a meeting at Camp David with President Obama, but he did have time to entertain a Hamas delegation in the hope of bringing Hamas under the Saudi wing. So things are in dramatic flux, and I think we need to think very hard and fast about what America's role is in the context of this sectarian conflict. Finally, just on the issue of IRGC benefits from the deal, you know, it has gone unmentioned that there is still a raft of U.S. unilateral sanctions on IRGC, Treasury sanctions, which if we want can have secondary effects and which are levied against IRGC for terrorism, for proliferation, for human rights violations, and the like. And I do believe that actually companies around the world recognize that we have these sanctions, that we may reassert them in a stronger sense, that is in a secondary sense, and therefore they are going to be cautious about getting involved with IRGC-dominated entities. Thank you. Mr. Engel. I just want to ask one quick question to anybody who would care to answer. We have seen some recent reports that have been unconfirmed that the head of the Quds Force, Soleimani, was severely injured in Syria. Have any of you heard that? Have you had any confirmation or lack of? Mr. Alfoneh. Sir, we only have heard the rumors, but he seems to be alive, and of course the Islamic Republic propaganda machinery is trying constantly to communicate the message that Major General Soleimani is still alive, so there is no news of the contrary and certainly not proof. Mr. Engel. Thank you. Thank, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Royce. So we go to Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you so much. Excellent hearing, Mr. Chairman and ranking member. As we have heard, and I agree with the chairman and the ranking member that the administration downplays concerns that Iran will use the sanctions relief it gets from the nuclear deal for its terror activities, instead of arguing that the money will be used to shore up a failing Iranian economy. But as we have heard, the IRGC is one of the major actors in the Iranian economy with a presence in nearly every sector. It has a particularly large presence in the same sectors that the administration is arguing that sanctions relief will go to: Construction, infrastructure, energy, finance. The administration is telling only one small part of the story and that we have only scratched the surface of what we should be sanctioning, including designating the IRGC and the Quds Force as foreign terrorist organizations. And, Mr. Alfoneh, in your written testimony, you mention your colleague Dr. Ottolenghi, who testified at our Middle East subcommittee on this IRGC issue 2 months ago, and you both argue that the administration should be reporting on the IRGC in much greater detail, including the subsidiaries of IRGC parent companies, the companies that have an IRGC controlling interest, and the exact nature of the IRGC support to Assad. How effective can our remaining sanctions be if we are not targeting the IRGC subsidiaries and commercial interests? And for Mr. Modell, you highlighted the nonkinetic activities of the Quds Force, including its work in setting up religious organizations, foundations, cultural centers, and testified that progress on U.S. efforts to counter this irregular warfare has been very limited. And as Mr. Duncan continually points out, we have seen a lot of Iranian activity in the Western Hemisphere throughout the Middle East to set up these types of influence, destabilization, recruitment centers, but very little effort by us in the United States to counter this. What is Iran's strategic goal in all of this, and where has it been more active, and why have our efforts to counter Iranian influence in this arena been so ineffective? Mr. Alfoneh. Mr. Alfoneh. Thank you. This is a very, very important point that you are raising, madam. The Revolutionary Guard, of course, is trying to hide its assets. There are so many front companies that the Revolutionary Guard is constantly creating, and, therefore, the Treasury here in the U.S. must, of course, also be extremely vigilant and be careful that they do not create companies that we are unaware of. One of the good allies of the U.S. in this cat-and-mouse game of course is what remains of the private sector in Iran because they certainly do believe that the Revolutionary Guard is trying to make their business impossible in Iran. And they also would be willing to cooperate identifying some of those companies of the Revolutionary Guards which is constantly popping up. And as you also pointed out, many of these activities are going to, you know, the money that flows into Iran goes back to the Revolutionary Guards because of their activities, particularly in the construction sector. Khatam al-Anbia construction headquarters of the Revolutionary Guards is the largest contractor in the entire Islamic Republic of Iran. Most of the public projects, development projects, in Iran, are handed over to the Khatam al-Anbia construction base on no-bid basis. So the private sector has no say. If they do participate in those projects, it is as subcontractors to the Revolutionary Guard. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you, and I am going to interrupt you here to give a minute to Mr. Modell. Mr. Modell. Thank you for your question. One of the things is, when you think about the way that Iran externalizes revolution, when you think about when Iran goes into a place like Iraq or Syria or Yemen or anywhere else, there is a lot of building from the ground up. So when I mentioned religious centers, mosques, cultural centers, and so forth, I think that that is a firm belief that, like Mr. Alfoneh suggested, it is more than just about terrorism and subversion. It is about actually altering the fabric of the places where they want to have control and influence in. So when they go and do this, it requires a lot of money. So, you know, when you think about the money that it takes to do this, one thing I would mention is a lot of people are speculating as to whether or not the Iranian Government is going to take this windfall that it is going to get from sanctions relief and direct it into the IRGC or the MOIS and other security elements of the government. I think, and Mr. Alfoneh might be among them, people have written about the fact that after the negotiations began in 2014, the IRGC budget went up. The Ministry of Intelligence budget went up, and this was just in anticipation of sanctions relief. This was publicly stated. This was publicly declared. So I think if you are asking yourself how the Iranians are going to spend the money, they have already been very clear in indicating it. But again it is not--and I agree with Ambassador Benjamin that it is cheap to pull off a terrorist attack or to do subterfuge, but we are talking about something that is much more transformational than that. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Royce. Thank you, Ileana. Mr. Brad Sherman of California. Mr. Sherman. Thank you. Terrorism may be cheap. War is expensive. One of the things that happened, just as soon as it was clear to those observing Congress that this deal would go through, and Iran would get its hands on $130 billion is Russia deployed sources to Syria. There was like a day between when I concluded--and I watch Congress--that this deal would be implemented and when Russia began its planning and deployment. I won't ask you gentlemen whether there is any proof that Iran is paying some or all of Russia's costs because my guess is that the Iranians don't share that information with you. Ambassador Benjamin when you say that we are on course to continue our success, you may be out of step with what Americans are seeing and feeling about the Middle East. Mr. Alfoneh, you say that Iran is moving from a theocracy to a military dictatorship. In a real short answer, can you tell me: Is the next generation going to be run by clerics who are true scholars of Islam based in Qom, or are guys with guns going to select the next grand Ayatollah? Mr. Alfoneh. Thank you for the fantastic question, sir. About the next generation of rulers in Iran, I think that Ayatollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran, has committed the worst mistake any civilian politician can make, and it is that he is systematically using the Revolutionary Guards to suppress his domestic opposition. And of course what happens is that when you invite a military organization to participate and intervene in domestic politics, you cannot throw them out again because they have guns and you are a civilian and do not have. Mr. Sherman. Got you. I do want to agree with some that have pointed out the dangers of the Quds Force and the Iranian regime in general. The Shi'ite alliance has killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people in Syria and killed far more Americans in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Marines in Beirut, than ISIS has ever aspired to. The difference is that ISIS when they kill 50 people, put it on YouTube. When Iranian-paid-for barrel bombs kill 1,000 villagers in Syria, Assad has the good taste to deny it. And for that reason, we tend to be focusing on ISIS as the most dangerous enemy. The question, I think it was Lenin asked, is what is to be done? You have convinced us that the Guard Force is a bad organization. We still have sanctions that are allowed under the nuclear agreement, tough sanctions on banks that conduct business on behalf of companies designated as a proliferator of WMD, which includes the IRGC, the Quds Force, many others. And what is often not mentioned in Section 302 that remains in force that provides for sanctions of those who engage in any significant activity with an IRGC entity. One problem is that we are not applying this to the National Iranian Oil Company, which I think you would agree is heavily involved with the IRGC. I am going to be distributing to all members of the committee a discussion draft of a statute aimed at the IRGC, and we now have a menu of sanctions that can be imposed against a bank or a company that does business with the IRGC. It shouldn't be a menu where maybe they just get some parsley, but rather an absolute ban on doing business in the United States which then can be lifted with specific licenses. So that a company that does any significant business with the IRGC would feel that it is going to lose all access to the U.S. market in doing business in the United States, and then it would have to go ask the administration for a license to go do this or that. And, second, in order to avoid neglect of the statute, it would have the GAO give Congress a list of those organizations that appear or are most likely to be doing business with the IRGC or its front groups, and those companies would be sanctioned unless the President within 6 months came to Congress and said, well, we shouldn't sanction this one and we shouldn't sanction that one. So if the administration did what the last three administrations have done, and just ignore Iran's sanctions, those sanctions would go into effect. So I look forward to working with the chairman and all the members and the ranking member on this discussion draft, and I also want to distribute it to our witnesses and ask you to comment on it for the record. I yield back. Chairman Royce. And I want to thank Congressman Brad Sherman for that draft. We will circulate it to all the members of the committee. We go now to Congressman Dana Rohrabacher of California. Mr. Rohrabacher. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. This hearing sort of cements my view that we are entering into a new historic era, and the cold war is over, and now I think the post-cold war is coming to a close, and I don't know what we are going to call this new era that we are in. Perhaps history will record it as the era of Islamic terrorism or Islamic resurgence, depending on how we see what unfolds in the next few years. But we are in a different world than we were 10 and 20 and 30 years ago. And I want to thank Chairman Royce. I want to thank Ranking Member Engel. We are facing a whole new era, and they are providing leadership so that we can understand the challenges that we face in this new era, and they both in sort of a bipartisan spirit and a spirit of getting to the facts, and I appreciate their leadership. Let me ask some specific questions, then about--knowledge questions. How many members does the IRGC have? What are we talking about in Iran? Talking about 50,000 people? What are we talking about there? Mr. Alfoneh. Sir, estimates are between 120 and 150,000 active members, active duty members of the Revolutionary---- Mr. Rohrabacher. Are they armed or are just others--anybody who is in a business owned by them or are we talking about the armed people? Mr. Alfoneh. These are the armed people, sir, in uniform. Mr. Rohrabacher. Okay. What is the regular army in Iran, and what is its size and how does it interact with this IRGC? Mr. Alfoneh. The regular military is sightly larger, but its bases are alongside the international boarders of Iran. And that is because of the constitution of Iran which gives a different mission to the regular military. The regular military has the mission of protecting the territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The mission of the Revolutionary Guards, according to the constitution, is to protect the revolution and its achievements in the abstract. Mr. Rohrabacher. Does the regular army get along with that? Is there any friction points there? Mr. Alfoneh. There are many ideological political commissars, in the regular military, which is, you know, a classical military organization. It is not ideological. Mr. Rohrabacher. Which would then be friction--cause friction between the two. In the IRGC, what ethnic makeup is that? We know in Iran about half the people are not Persian, but is the IRGC basically a Persian group, or do they have Kurdish people in it or Azeris, or Baluchs or Azeris or whoever? What is the makeup of---- Mr. Alfoneh. Yes, sir. We do believe that it actually reflects the ethnic composition of Iran as a whole. Mr. Rohrabacher. So there are Kurds who are---- Mr. Alfoneh.--yes, sir. Mr. Rohrabacher [continuing]. Members of that as well as-- -- Mr. Alfoneh. Shiite Kurds, yes. Mr. Rohrabacher. Okay. Now, in terms of the support of the IRGC for terrorism around the world, how many missiles, for example, we have all seen these rockets that go off and are shot by--out of the Gaza Strip into Israel, and I consider that to be a terrorist act. Anytime you shoot rockets into a country, especially if it is indiscriminately to try to just murder people, I would say that is terrorism. How many of these terrorist rockets that are going into Israel from the Gaza Strip and elsewhere, were either manufactured or paid for by the IRGC? Mr. Modell. Thank you for the question. I think the vast majority if not all of them. And not only that, the next generation is actually providing them with the ability to manufacture them themselves. Mr. Rohrabacher. I didn't catch that last part. Mr. Modell. I would say the vast majority have been provided to them by Iran. They are linked to Iran, Iranian manufacturers, but what Iran's next phase of support in providing missiles to groups operating in the West Bank and in southern Lebanon is to actually give them the capacity to develop those missiles themselves. Mr. Rohrabacher. I see. And we might note Congressman Engel and myself, and Ed--I am not sure if Ed was with us on that trip or not, but I remember when we crawled in--you were with us, when we crawled into these tunnels that were dug. And that was--they were not just crawl spaces. These were very expensive construction projects. Are those things being paid for by the IRGC? Mr. Modell. You know, from years ago I can tell you that the intelligence community I think was divided on that question. But I think the Iranians were working very closely with Lebanese Hezbollah in developing those, those tunnels. But as far as financing goes---- Mr. Rohrabacher. These terrorists, whether they are people who are Palestinians who are conducting terrorism on Israel or these other, they don't have really a large source of money and what we are talking about when we say financing. This is a vital component to the existence of these terrorists. One last note, Mr. Chairman, and I know my time is running out, is that we have a similar situation from what you described in China, where you have the People's Liberation Army controls and actually receives the profit from a large number of commercial operations. And if people are investing in that and those companies are making a profit, it is going to the People's Liberation Army and not to the people of China. So go ahead. Mr. Modell. I would just like to make one comment on that. I think you raise a very important point. And if you go back in time to the origin of Lebanese Hezbollah when Iran was--in the early 1980s when Iran was instrumental in figuring out what is the grand vision going to be for this organization, what is their mission going to be, one of the things that took years and years for them to develop was a global commercial apparatus that was composed of businesses, that was composed of a lot of things you just mentioned, that actually create independent streams of revenue that they are off the books. And Iran is doing it. Hezbollah is doing it. And Hezbollah's dependence on Iranian official funds over the years has gone down for that reason. Mr. Rohrabacher. Thank you. Chairman Royce. Yes. You raised the point, Mr. Rohrabacher, on those tunnels and who paid for their construction. I would just make the point, myself, and Mr. Engel, and Mr. Rohrabacher, and Mr. Gregory Meeks, were in those tunnels shortly after the Gaza operation. And it was reminiscent to me, in 2006, the Iranian constructed tunnels done for Hezbollah, their engineers were involved in that. We know that from ID badges that were picked up after the 2006 second Lebanon War. I was there during that conflict. And in this particular case, not only do you have indication that Iran was involved in also the tunnels under Gaza, this particular tunnel that we were in, came up underneath a village. And the plan apparently was to capture students, because it was a school. It was an elementary school that it was under. And to pull them back into Gaza so that the IDF would have to fight house by house. But the most important point is that after the conflict was over, the report surfaced which was in the Wall Street Journal, as I recall, in which Iran committed to rebuilding those tunnels that were closed, some 30 plus were discovered, for Hamas. Now, we understand Iran also supports, you know, the Palestinian Islamic jihad. In other words, they are not just supporting Hamas in Gaza. They have a secondary organization that they would prefer. But they are providing Hamas. The story also mentioned they committed to providing again to resupply the rockets to Hamas. So, you know, it is an on-again/off-again depending on geopolitics in the area in terms of how much support they provide Hamas. They clearly would prefer Islamic jihad as an organization, but I think it is unquestionable that they have been involved in this enterprise. And, indeed, those reports regularly appear in the media. So I would just, Ambassador, point that out for posterity. Ambassador Benjamin. If I may, Chairman Royce, historically there is no question that Iran was a principal sponsor of Hamas, and I believe the exclusive sponsor of Hezbollah. However, I believe the best information we have today is that Iran is not transferring any resources to Hamas now. And Hamas' budget is dependent entirely on its international fundraising efforts. And that includes money that it receives from Qatar and from Turkey, that is to say, from the Sunni side of the equation. And it doesn't appear likely after repeated meetings between Hamas and Saudi Arabia that Iran is going to forgive Hamas, what it views as treasonous activities. So I think it is important that these distinctions be recognized. Chairman Royce. Well, thank you. Hopefully they don't follow through on their commitment to rebuild those tunnels. We will go, then, to Albio Sires from New Jersey who is next in the queue. Mr. Sires. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for being here today. You know, I have been to a number of hearings, and every time I sit here and sooner or later the comment is made that the Supreme Leader is losing support from the Iranian people. I was just wondering, after the nuclear deal, have the Iranian people lost hope that there could be a change, or has the Supreme Leader solidified his position, and have the Revolutionary Guards solidified their positions now that they have a deal, and they are going to get all this money? Sir? Mr. Alfoneh. Sir, it is an important point that you are making and a good question. I am not sure if I know the answer, but I will try my best. Mr. Khomeini needed someone, a technocratic type, like Mr. Rouhani to get people to vote for the regime in order to secure some degree of legitimacy for this regime. And the only reason Mr. Rouhani was elected as President of the Republic was because that he promised the Iranian public a nuclear deal with the U.S. This is why the Iranian people elected him. However, now that he is elected and now that the nuclear deal is made, Mr. Khomeini no longer needs Mr. Rouhani. He no longer needs the technocratic elites of Iran. So I think the best test is going to be the parliamentary elections of February. Is Mr. Khomeini going to allow Mr. Rouhani and his technocratic elites of Iran to be elected into the Parliament, for example? Or is he systematically going to filter every single supporter of Mr. Rouhani among those candidates? And if he does that, and I strongly suspect it is going to happen, then we will see the rise of the Revolutionary Guards and a reaction among the Iranian public which is one of hopelessness. So in one sense, yes. The Iranian public has lost faith twice; once during the Green Revolution of 2009 when unfortunately the administration extended a hand of friendship to the regime, to Mr. Khomeini and not to the Iranian public, and second time when a nuclear deal was made where the greatest beneficiary is the Revolutionary Guards and not the Iranian public. Mr. Modell. Thanks for your question. The only thing I would add to that is I think that there is somewhat of a misconception when you talk about Khomeini as being an all powerful figure in Iran. I think there is--to a certain degree he is weak in the sense that he is constantly forced to balance conflicting factions of a very, very--in fact, much more developed series of political factions than when he took over in 1989. You have a much more mature playing field that he has to balance. And he needs the IRGC just as much as the IRGC needs him. So, you know, if Iranians ask themselves was the election of Rouhani and the JCPOA, do those give us hope or not, I think the Iranians are hopeful. If you look at polls, Iran is hopeful. But they don't equate it to a simple will Khomeini allow us to continue to have freedoms and advance or not. The Iranians recognize the complexity that Khomeini has to balance, and it is not an easy thing to do. And like Mr. Alfoneh pointed out, I think next February is going to be very critical in seeing just how much the IRGC has done to actually push back and ensure that, you know, if there is any momentum toward Rouhani, it slows down. Mr. Sires. Ambassador? Ambassador Benjamin. Both of my colleagues have made very insightful remarks. I would just add that if there is one tried and true pattern in history, it is that the frustration of rising expectations is profoundly dangerous for rulers. And expectations have been raised dramatically in Iran. Rouhani is extremely popular. The notion that Iran is going to have an opening to the West, that the Iranian economy will get a new rush of oxygen, and that they will see greater prosperity I think is now quite clear. And so I think that the Supreme Leader, you know, has to walk a fine line if he wants to maintain his own standing while not disappointing the expectations of the Iranian people. This brings me back to something actually that Mr. Engel said before about regime change. I think that we found over the last 30-plus years that regime change anywhere in the world is a perilous course of action. And I think that the virtues of the JCPOA have largely been underestimated in terms of creating a 15-year period, which is a significant period of time, in which those expectations can arise, flourish, and shape the course of the Iranian future. To be sure, we have to be vigilant about bad behavior, but I think this is no small achievement. And we can't say for certain that in 15 years Iran will be a more hopeful place, but we, I think, can say with some certainty that without it we would be facing a very dire situation. And now we have given the Iranian people, you know, some reason to, shall we say, vote with their feet. Mr. Sires. Thank you very much. My time is up. Chairman Royce. Mr. Matt Salmon. Mr. Salmon. Thank you. In your view, and this question is to all panel members, is the administration's growing diplomatic outreach to Iran, and some might say acquiescence, particularly considering Iran's support for strife in the region, undermining U.S. credibility in the region? Start with you, Ambassador. Ambassador Benjamin. Well, I think it is an interesting and important question. There is no question--there is no doubt that among our Sunni allies our, Sunni partners, there is significant doubt about this, and they are committed to a policy, by and large, of not talking to Iran although they do themselves, and of doing everything they can to beat back what they see as the Shia tide. Having said that, it is not entirely clear to me that their perception of what is going on is accurate. You know, the Sunnis are also culpable, it seems to me, particularly the Gulf Sunnis, for the humanitarian catastrophe that is Syria, because they have been pouring more and more resources in at every juncture to try to topple the Assad regime. And there has been very little desire to find an off ramp there. Similarly, although the, you know, the Yemenconflict is extremely complicated, what has I think been lost sight of is that one of the critical changes was that longtime strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh, which sides essentially, and tried to relitigate what happened in the Arab Spring and the election of--or the installation of President Hadi, and so this has been seen as another bit of Iranian perfidy. It is true that we don't like what they are doing with the Houthis, but this has also led, you know, to a campaign against, you know, an outside war against Yemen that has caused another humanitarian catastrophe. So I think that the situations is very complicated. I think, you know, the Israeli Government's view was quite clear. But having said that, it is impressive how much of the Israeli defense establishment, I think, has come around to approve of the JCPOA and has been encouraged by the direction things are taking. Mr. Salmon. Thank you. I am going to shift gears because I have a couple of other questions. I did want to get that one out there. But I have a question for you, Mr. Alfoneh, and then one for you as well, Mr. Modell, if I can just throw them both out. First to you, you recommend that the U.S. should still pursue the dual goal of toppling Assad regime and fight ISIS at the same time. Even if we are able to topple the Assad regime, which will be increasingly difficult with the overt support of Assad by Russia and the covert support by Iran, what next? And wouldn't the most likely outcome be an Iranian or Russian puppet or a controlled puppet regime? Or perhaps even worse a fractured lawless Syria that will give ISIS a larger power base and more territory to control? Is this really the policy that is going to bring stability to the region? And my add-on question to you, Mr. Modell, is very similar. Do you think Iran or ISIS poses the bigger threat to national security, our national security, both in the short and the long term? I would like your thoughts on that. Mr. Alfoneh. Sir, I do believe that one of the reasons that the Alawite elites in Syria are backing Bashar al-Assad is that they have absolutely no alternative as things are right now. If they are given an alternative, if there are security guarantees that there is not going to be genocide of Alawites after the Sunnis also take part in government. And if a government like the United States is willing to give that type of guarantees to the Alawites, why should they stick with someone who has led to destruction of their own countries? I do believe that there is dissatisfaction even among Alawite elites in Syria, but they have honestly nowhere else to go. Mr. Salmon. Mr. Modell. Mr. Modell. As to your question as to what presents a greater short- or long-term risk to U.S. national security between Iran and ISIS, you know, I guess it depends. I mean, you know, if you are talking about lone wolf terrorist attacks in the United States or, you know, bombings like 9/11 or the Paris attacks, obviously ISIS. But at the same time, I think if you look at the heart of what Iran is doing, okay, the ideologically driven externalization of its Islamic revolution and everything that represents, if you believe the vast majority of our allies, our current allies at least, in the Gulf and elsewhere, are never going to be okay with that. And they are going to always be opposed to that in a fundamental way, then I think as long as we have a long-term fundamental reason to stay in the Middle East, that is the bigger term of threat in terms of creating a permanent destabilizing presence in the region. Mr. Salmon. Thank you. I yield back. Chairman Royce. Mr. David Cicilline of Rhode Island. Mr. Cicilline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to our witnesses. And I think all of us, particularly after viewing your testimony and several other hearings we have had on this issue understand that we have to do everything that we can and use all of the tools available to us to keep the pressure on and really took to confront the IRGC and Iran and the region. So my questions are first to you, Mr. Modell. You said the Obama administration has demonstrated an unwillingness to weaken the IRGC. So I am asking you what you think the administration should be doing to effectively weaken the IRGC? Mr. Modell. One of the things that I mention in my recommendations was the fact that the IRGC, if you want to look at one of the things that concerns the IRGC and the Supreme Leader and the conservative establishment in Iran, is that is the ongoing credibility of the IRGC. The IRGC--we have had one serious kingpin designation against the Iranians, against an IRGC general who was involved in narco trafficking with the Taliban and others. He is based in Balochistan and---- Mr. Cicilline. I have limited time so can---- Mr. Modell. Oh, sorry. Mr. Cicilline [continuing]. You just tell me, you know, what you think we should do. Mr. Modell. Recommendations? I think naming and shaming. I think there needs to be a campaign, a media campaign, not a covert. I think an open media influence campaign that points out all the things that the Iranian--that the IRGC, in particular, is doing to destabilize the region. I don't think we have done nearly enough of that. Mr. Cicilline. Okay. And with respect to the designation of the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization, does anyone on the panel think they don't meet that definition? And if you don't, why not? And what would be the implications of that designation, particularly on Americans being held, but on any other facets of this conflict? Ambassador? Ambassador Benjamin. So the designation of the IRGC as a State Department-designated foreign terrorist organization, would be at odds with the entire history of designations, first of all, in that it would be a designating a state organ, a state entity. Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism, and as such is covered by a wide raft of different sanctions that are extremely comprehensive. And to add the IRGC to this, it seems to me, would add, practically speaking, nothing to our arsenal of tools, nothing meaningful. And what is more is that there remains in effect a large array of Treasury designations against the IRGC as I mentioned before for terrorism, proliferation, human rights violations. We have all the instruments we need. And I think that to do something additional like this would both be unnecessary from a functional standpoint. And from a signalling standpoint, I am not sure that it is exactly what we need at precisely the moment that we want to see more--we want to see an effective implementation of the JCPOA. Mr. Cicilline. Well, with respect to that, Ambassador Benjamin, you said in your testimony that additional terrorism campaign or an additional terrorist campaign by Iran would scuttle the agreement, referring to the JCPOA. Why do you think that would scuttle the agreement? I don't see anything in the agreement that would, in fact, be in violation if they engage in terrorism. But the argument was made that it is better to confront a nonnuclear Iran than a nuclear Iran, which I agree. And you said the U.S. is in a good position to deter and prevent increased terrorist activity. Through what means? What do you think would be the most effective way for the United States to do that, particularly since I don't think engaging in terrorism is a direct violation of the JCPOA. Ambassador Benjamin. I think as a political matter if there were a widespread perception that Iran was using this opportunity to carry out a widespread--a massive terror campaign, I think that it would inevitably cause a reaction by Washington. I think that is just pure commonsense politics. In terms of being able to deter, let's just break it down. And I will recap some of my testimony. So Iran has, since 1996, not carried out a terrorist attack against the United States, and has only had one major plot revealed, and that was the very, very strange Arbabsiar plot involving the desire to kill the Saudi Ambassador here in Washington. I think that the Iranians have a healthy respect for our counterterrorism capabilities, for our intelligence gathering, and for our law enforcement, and are unwilling to be caught and to risk the kind of global opprobrium that they experienced after the Arbabsiar plot when there was an overwhelming U.N. general assembly resolution condemning them. I do believe that they will continue to try to provoke Israel, and I think that they will try to show that they can do two things at once and that they are still the leaders of the resistance. And I think for that reason our commitment to Israel's security has to be unwavering. We have to continue funding Iron Dome and continue the very robust support for Israeli defense, intelligence, and counterterrorism activities. And as for how we work with our Arab partners, you know, I think that the solution, the secret of our success has been excellent intelligence. And I think that we should deepen that intelligence cooperation with these countries. But, you know, I just note that the circumstances are becoming more difficult as some of these countries are themselves doing things that cross red lines for us, including, for example, their support of extremist groups in Syria. And so to come back to my main theme, we are living in a different Middle East. And I think that we need to think long and hard about what America's role is in the midst of this sectarian conflict. Mr. Cicilline. Thank you. And my time is up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Royce. Mr. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina. Mr. Duncan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ambassador Benjamin, I want to go to your statement for just a minute which I thought was spot on in so many ways. But you say that Iran remains by a significant margin the foremost state sponsor of terror today. You go on to talk about Iranian terrorist activity focused primarily on support to groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic jihad. And then you say roughly 5 years ago Iran and its proxy Hezbollah appeared to be laying the groundwork for a renewed campaign of terrorism outside of the Middle East. Notable arrests in places like Thailand, Kenya, India, Azerbaijan, Cypress, Bulgaria, and that operatives responsible were traced back to Lebanon and Hezbollah. So we are very familiar with the Iranian Hezbollah connection. So let's take a moment, and I chair the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee. Let's bring this closer to home. January 8 of this year there was an attempted bombing in Montevideo, Uruguay, that targeted the Israeli Embassy. A few days later, an Iranian diplomat Ahmed Sabatgold, 32, a political consultant of the Iranian Embassy suspected of being involved in placing the explosive device, fled the country. Wasn't expelled, but fled the country. We also know that very close to Uruguay is the tri-border region, which is heavily Lebanese Hezbollah. Lot of financial transaction and other things. You could tie that into the bombing in Buenos Aires. You could go back a long ways, but just keeping it present day, January in Uruguay. And then we had five Syrian refugees, migrants, whatever you want to call them, who traveled on fake Israeli passports to, hello, the tri-border region where they were able to purchase, through Hezbollah, other fraudulent passports which turned out to be Greek passports. After travelling a little bit in South America, made their way to Honduras on fake Greek passports. Now, they may have been farmers, may have been students. We don't know what their plans were, but there is a connection between illicit activity in the tri-border region and Hezbollah, which is an Iranian proxy organization, tied to terrorism all over the globe, not just the ones that I mentioned in Uruguay and Argentina. And if you think about what you mentioned in your statement about, and I can't pronounce his name, but the Iranian that was implicated in the assassination attempt of October 2012--is that right--trying to come across the southern border with the help of the Mexican cartel, and lo and behold, it was a DEA agent. We got lucky. May not always get lucky. Then you factor in the issue that General Kelly at SOUTHCOM brings up that Iran has opened 80 cultural centers in Latin America in the last, what, 15 years or less, where there is not really a large Muslim population. Okay? So we got tri-border region and Hezbollah. We have got 80 cultural centers in Latin America. We got an attempt by a Quds Force operative to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador by coming across our southern border working with the drug cartel. We have got General Kelly pointing out the cultural centers and raising the alarm. So I just want to hear your thoughts on how we combat Iran and the Quds force here in the Western Hemisphere knowing all of this. And am I wrong to start raising the flag about this issue? Ambassador. Ambassador Benjamin. So Hezbollah has been present in many, many countries around the world since, really, the 1980s. And their presence is overwhelmingly in the Western Hemisphere and in West Africa where there are lots of Hezbollah operatives. It has been overwhelmingly about economic activity, but we still need to be very vigilant about the possibility that they may seek to get involved in violence. The United States has close liaison relations with most of the countries in the hemisphere, and takes the responsibility to surveil these operations very, very seriously. With the exception of Venezuela, I think we have had very good cooperation from most of our partners. And of course you didn't mention Venezuela which has been a subject of concern regarding Hezbollah, in particular Iran, for many years. And I think that, you know, this is the world we live in. I have written and said on many times that we need to continue our investments in intelligence and in law enforcement, and work with these countries to ensure that we have tabs on everyone who is doing anything, and then to prompt them when the time comes to take legal action or to expel these people. And on many occasions they have done so. I actually think that the level of Hezbollah infrastructure, and I haven't had an intelligence community assessment on this in some time, and I am no longer in the government, but I think the level of Hezbollah infrastructure is somewhat diminished from what it was in, say, the 1990s. And we have had some really impressive successes against Hezbollah. For example, the case involving the Lebanese Canadian Bank which led to the forfeiture of I believe $140 million in assets, including the uncovering of this large-scale operation that involved sending used cars to West Africa in which--from the Western Hemisphere where they were then sold across Africa and the profits were mingled with Hezbollah drug money, for example, and then passed on to Hezbollah in Lebanon. So, we can't eliminate all of these bad actors everywhere at once, but I think that we have shown over time that we have a very, very capable intelligence community and our leaguettes around the world are working very, very hard, our FBI representatives, and I think that we continue this to keep the pressure on the group. Right now it is a group that is somewhat stretched by its involvement in Syria, and a group that I think wants to avoid being embroiled in an even wider conflict than the one it is. So it is, for example, being careful vis a vis Israel. But, you know, at the State Department when I was coordinator, we kept a very close eye on this and were in touch with our colleagues around the world whenever we felt there was a need. And I think that we can continue those policies to curb Hezbollah activity. I believe you have to go back to the bombings in Argentina to find any violent activity in this hemisphere by Hezbollah. Mr. Duncan. And for your information, for the record, the State Department now doesn't take the Iranian activity, Hezbollah's activity in the Western Hemisphere much of a threat. And I have got the report that shows they did a very poor job in evaluating that. So---- Ambassador Benjamin. Well, I think--so I would have to go back and look at the country reports or anything that they have submitted to you. I think that it is probably justified to say that the threat level is low but that the economic activity remains a matter of concern. Compared to the Sunni threat, compared to ISIS, compared to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, I think that the threat from Hezbollah to Americans specifically is quite low. Mr. Duncan. Okay. I am out of time. I appreciate your frankness and I yield back. Chairman Royce. Thank you, Mr. Duncan. We go now to Mr. Ted Deutch of Florida. Mr. Deutch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the witnesses for being here. And, Mr. Chairman, thanks for holding this hearing and giving us the opportunity to be reminded of Iran's sport for terrorism and the actions of the IRGC in particular. And I would like to focus in on one part of the JCPOA that we have touched on briefly, but I really want to understand better. We are moving forward under this deal, and there is a long list of individuals and entities who will see sanctions relief under the JCPOA. Coming off of the sanctions coming off are nuclear proliferation sanctions. This hearing is about Iran's support for terrorism. And we know that under existing law, individuals and entities can and should be sanctioned for their support for terrorism and for violation of human rights. So the question for all three of you is, shouldn't we, in advance of providing any sanctions relief to those individuals or entities for proliferation sanctions, shouldn't we go through all of them, determine which ones should still be sanctioned for their support for terrorism and never let them off to begin with? Mr. Alfoneh. Sir, I think in this context we need to distinguish between U.S. sanctions and EU sanctions because what we see is that most of the--actually all, every single individual and entity owned or connected by the Revolutionary Guards, still remains sanctioned by the U.S. Government. But when it comes to the European sanctions regime, they are going to remove actually most of the Revolutionary Guards units and personnel 8 years from the time of the implementation day. So the Europeans 8 years from now may be doing, engaging in---- Mr. Deutch. I understand that, Mr. Alfoneh. But I am focused on those individuals and entities who will get sanctions relief when sanctions relief is initially granted, not 8 years from now, but when they meet their nuclear related obligations. And from everything that I have read, there are-- everyone will acknowledge that some of them are on that list, some may be on there and are on there dual sanctioned for proliferation and for terrorism, but there are others who are on the list because it is easier to put them on the list for proliferation than it would have been to prove their support for terrorism. But if we are serious about stopping Iran from supporting terrorism, have any of you looked at that list and identified the individuals and entities who support terrorism and who should not be considered for sanctions relief at all? Mr. Modell. Mr. Modell. Let me just say one of the recommendations I made the last time I testified which addressed this same question was, Treasury, which does a lot of great work, one of the things they either--and when asked by me directly to some people over there: Have you ever undertaken a comprehensive study to look at all the people who have been sanctioned and designated on the SDN lists, sort of where they are today, where that are now, how have they been impacted, are they still in business, how are they subverting sanctions, so forth. And the answer is, you know, they are poorly resourced. That is a different issue. But the answer I think to your question is is yes they should because a number of the people that are coming off the list, and I have seen a few that I haven't--that I am thinking of in particular were part of what is nothing short of a global trends national organized crime effort on the part of Iran. And in this case it was to circumvent sanctions and nuclear related issues. But those people were willing to commit crimes on behalf of the Iranian Government then. Now that you are taking them off the list, they are not going to stop being part of this global apparatus that is involved in illicit procurement activities. Mr. Deutch. Right. And, Ambassador Benjamin, there was a statement within the past few weeks from the Supreme Leader who said--I think it was the Supreme Leader who said that any effort to re-impose sanctions will be a violation of the deal. But clearly that wouldn't be a violation of the deal. The terror related sanctions were never meant to be a part of the deal. That is what we were told throughout. That is clearly the view of this committee, of the administration. So shouldn't we be, before granting sanctions relief, shouldn't we be pushing back to disabuse anyone in Iran of the notion that lifting of sanctions for nuclear proliferation means lifting of sanctions altogether? Ambassador Benjamin. Well, I think your point is well taken. I think that the administration has been doing that pretty clearly in statements by the President, Secretary Kerry, Wendy Sherman, and the like. No one has been, to my mind, delisted for terrorism activities. If anything, everyone has been reaffirming that Iran is and will remain designated as a state sponsor. I cannot really say anything informed about the listings the Treasury has on individuals for terrorism, but I have certainly never heard that there have been people listed under proliferation because it was easier to do that than to do them for reasons of terrorism. Obviously these lists should be scrubbed regularly. There are issues of resources, but I think we just continue to repeat the message over and over again that bad behavior absolutely will not be tolerated. Mr. Deutch. Right. I understand. But, Ambassador Benjamin, shouldn't we scrub that list now, before sanctions relief is granted, to any of those individuals or entities to make sure that if someone on that list has been supporting terrorism and should be subject to sanctions that they continue to be subject to sanctions and they never come off that list? Ambassador Benjamin. I think that is self-evident. I think that if you find people who are sanctionable because of terrorist activity, they should be sanctioned, and we have made it clear that we will do that. We did it before and we should do it again. Mr. Deutch. And we should do it before there are sanctions relief granted. I appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Engel [presiding]. We will go to Mr. McCaul. Mr. McCaul. I thank the chairman. Mr. Engel. That sounds nice, Mr. McCaul. We have a good chairman right now. Mr. McCaul. Yes, we do. Let me just--in 2012 the Obama administration basically admitted that the IRGC was one of the most powerful economic actors within Iran, that they own a network of front companies all over the world, essentially. And so while they claim that upon implementation day that the sanctions will still be in place on the IRGC. Wouldn't these front companies that are owned by the IRGC benefit? And, therefore, wouldn't the IRGC benefit directly from the lifting of these sanctions? I will start with you, Mr. Alfoneh. Mr. Alfoneh. Yes, sir. You know, to the extent that the Revolutionary Guards manages to establish new front companies, it would of course benefit, you know, by sanction evasion from the United States, but would also most directly benefit from the sanctions relief because the Iranian Government is funding the Revolutionary Guards' engagement in the economy of Iran. Even during the Presidency of Mr. Rouhani who certainly does not seem to be a fan of the Revolutionary Guards, there seems to be more Revolutionary Guards participation in development of Iran's economy, in many public projects which have been granted to the Revolutionary Guards, and I also think that this is the miscalculation of President Rouhani. He thought that he could buy and bribe the Revolutionary Guards not to oppose a nuclear deal. But what of course what will happen now is that the Revolutionary Guards takes the money and they will oppose the nuclear deal during the implementation phase. Mr. McCaul. That is interesting. Mr. Modell? I am sorry. Let's go down the--okay. Ambassador. Ambassador Benjamin. I would just point out that there is sort of this belief that we are headed into a completely binary change. And the fact is, as I think has been well demonstrated over the years, the threat of Treasury sanctions is an enormous threat and a big hammer. We have unilateral sanctions remaining on lots of IRGC entities. And I think that the likelihood that foreign investors--of course no Americans will be investing because of the retention of our sanctions. But the likelihood that, say, European or Asian investors are going to suddenly strike deals with these entities if there is any shadow hanging over them is quite limited. Because in the end, the U.S. is still going to be prepared to cut those companies off from credit markets, and our ability to do so is quite remarkable. So, yes, in theory there is a danger there, and it is one we need to be vigilant about. But the Treasury has never been particularly shy about sharing information about those connections. And I expect they will be very aggressive in the future too. Mr. McCaul. And maybe, Mr. Modell, I will let you comment, and I will just throw out the last question because my time is running out. And that is there has been some discussion that under the section 219 of the Immigration Nationality Act that the IRGC should qualify as a foreign terrorist organization. I think that would give complete certainty that the lifting of sanctions would not benefit the IRGC. But I would throw that out to you. Mr. Modell. One of things I want to mention on your front company question before was that when you look at the ability of--and this is based on my own experience, but with the experience in talking to people who are serving--U.S. Government officials serving in the region now. When they approach our allies, particularly in the Southern Gulf, and ask for cooperation on trying to dismantle front companies, try to get more cooperation in working against front companies, working closely with the financial intelligence units to learn more about how they are moving men and money and material throughout the region, a lot of walls are put up. And I think if you are going to get serious about it, you need to go to places like the Emirates where there are hundreds and hundreds of companies that are springing up all the time that are in very few ways deterred by any sanctions that have been going on. So that is something I think needs to be addressed. Mr. McCaul. That is a great point. What about the designation as a foreign terrorist organization? Would you agree that they should be? Mr. Modell. You know, I just think it is so intertwined. I appreciate, you know, Ambassador Benjamin's point earlier that it would go against historical precedent, but I think when you look at the way the dimensions of the IRGC and how interwoven they are with regard to a singular mission of--that happens to overlap with terrorism and a lot of the illicit activities they do around the world, I just don't know how you are going to deter them otherwise. And I think one point that needs to be made is the Iranians have been very clear in saying, maybe not explicitly, but their main goal has always been to get rid of European sanctions. That is how it was before 2012. They were perfectly fine to live with a comprehensive trade ban. They can survive with it or without it. So I think if you are going to get--you know, it is worth exploring that if you did do that you would have an extra deterrent for Europeans to do business with them, and that might be an extra way of prodding them to change their behavior---- Mr. McCaul. Mr. Alfoneh, do you have any opinion on that? Mr. Alfoneh. My organization agrees with Mr. Modell's suggestion that the entire organization should be designated as a foreign terrorist organization. I have a slightly different approach in this regard because I would like to punish those entities of the Revolutionary Guards which take part in the war in Syria. And we can document their presence in Syria. And the difference, I think, hopefully, and both are methods, I think, you know, have their own, you know, merits, but I also believe that my approach would have the added value of starting a process and discussion hopefully within the Revolutionary Guards. So they try to understand the price that they are paying for supporting Basar al-Assad's regime and keeping on his throne of blood. Mr. McCaul. And, Ambassador, I presume you would be opposed to that designation? Ambassador Benjamin. Yes. I did summarize my reasons before. Again, it would be, on the one hand, a complete break with our tradition of how we do foreign terrorist organizations. We have never designated at the State Department a government organ. And I think that actually the existing sanctions under the designation of Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism, as well as the whole array of other executive order, Treasury designations and the like, are more than ample currently for--certainly for enforcement purposes. And I don't see any additional messaging purpose that would be fulfilled through this. Mr. McCaul. I see my time has expired. Chairman Royce. Lois Frankel of Florida. Ms. Frankel. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you. This has been a very interesting discussion. And I have some very, I will say, simplistic questions. First of all, in terms of--we have been saying IRGC, and then we are talking about Iran. For the funding of Hezbollah, is it the IRGC that funds Hezbollah, or is it Iran, or is it both? How does that exchange happen? Mr. Alfoneh. I only do my analysis, you know, in open source. So it is very difficult for me to give you a precise answer. But, you know, the way that it operates is usually indirect. So the Iranian Government, in the old days, in the 1980s, for example, they would on the national budget tell the entire world that Iran is supporting, let's say, Islamic jihad or Hezbollah, and be so and so many millions of dollars. But then in mid-1980s there were several lawsuits against the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the U.S. because there were victims and family members of victims of terrorists who could refer to the national budget of the Islamic Republic of Iran and prove that Iran is a state sponsor of terrorists. So ever since mid-1980s, the Islamic Republic has been trying to hide the mechanisms through which they send money to Hezbollah. So we do not have open source information available for you. But some of that money is through Revolutionary Guards. Some of that money is through the office of the Supreme Leader. Some of that money is through the cultural centers. Even the construction base of the Revolutionary Guards, Khatam al-Anbia, is engaged in housing projects in Lebanon, particularly after the 2006 war. So there are multiple channels through which the Islamic Republic is funding Hezbollah. Ms. Frankel. Did you want to answer? Because I have a couple other questions. Ambassador Benjamin. I would just say very quickly, I think it is a kind of distinction without a difference. Hezbollah is funded because it is a national priority of the Government of Iran. Ms. Frankel. Okay. So my next question really has to do with, I guess, the relativity of Hezbollah's efforts in the Middle East toward the conflict. If Hezbollah was not present in Syria, how much difference do you think that would make? Mr. Alfoneh. Well, the Bashar regime would have collapsed because the Islamic Republic was not ready a few years ago to deploy large-scale forces of the Revolutionary Guards in Syria. Hezbollah has been doing the job of the Revolutionary Guards and seems also to have been suffering a large number of casualties. My study of the Iranian casualties shows me that since January 2012, 201 Iranians have been killed in combat in Syria. The number for Lebanese fighters, Hezbollah fighters in Syria, in the same period of time seems to be above 1,000, possibly 1,500. Ms. Frankel. So does anyone else want to take a stab at that? So let me say, if Hezbollah was removed or if--let me put it this way: If Hezbollah was not being funded by Iran, would there be more likely a collapse of the Assad regime? Ambassador Benjamin. I think I would only say, and we are in a very hypothetical world here---- Ms. Frankel. Yes. Ambassador Benjamin [continuing]. That it is kind of hard to imagine what that world would be like because Iran's interest in Syria is above all about the resupply and the connection with Hezbollah. So, you know, we would be taking the heart out of the jigsaw puzzle. Ms. Frankel. No, no, the reason I guess--well, my motive for asking that question is because I think a lot of us were concerned with this Iran agreement because we saw a direct connection between Iran getting money, more money, funding Hezbollah, and creating this horrible conflict in Syria. So let me just ask another question if I could follow up. If Iran was not funding Hezbollah, what would you think would be the affect on peace in Israel? Mr. Modell. Again, that is a big hypothetical, but let me just--let me make a couple of comments on the Iran/Hezbollah relationship, the way I have seen it evolve, particularly since 2012. Point number one is when sanctions really started to hit, okay, entire operational units of the IRGC itself had to--their funding levels went down. Their activities, as a result, went down. And not only IRGC, but Hezbollah as well and other groups that were on the receiving end of Iranian Government funding also were put on hold. So before the JCPOA took place and the Iranians were feeling the brunt of this pain of sanctions, their operational activity did decline, and but I would also say that Hezbollah has evolved into its own organization. It has its own identity. And to a certain extent by Hezbollah--over the last decade, if not more, Hezbollahhas developed its own ways of generating revenue. They don't depend entirely on Iran as they did in the earliest years of the revolution. Ms. Frankel. Okay. Well, that was really what my question was. So you are saying now that--well, what would you say percentage-wise their own funding versus relying on Iran? Mr. Alfoneh. The open source, I cannot give you a precise estimate, madam, unfortunately. Ms. Frankel. Mr. Chairman, I have one more--I think it is like--well, three of us are left here. We have had so many different meetings in the last month or 2 months or whatever, or the year, about what is going on in Syria. In your opinion, will the IRGC be okay with a transition out of Assad? Mr. Alfoneh. The clear answer is no, madam. They have invested in the person of Bashar al-Assad. All the commanders, senior commanders, of the Revolutionary Guards have supported Bashar al-Assad personally in the Iranian press. It would be a terrible loss of face for them. But there seems to be discussions within the regime. So the President of Iran, President Rouhani, he has sent some signals which we could interpret as some degree of readiness to cooperate with someone else, you know, than Bashar al-Assad. But that is not the signals we hear from the Revolutionary Guards. Ms. Frankel. Anybody else? Ambassador Benjamin. I would just say that it is very hard to conceive of any Iranian acquiescence in a peace plan that involves both the removal of Assad and his non-replacement by one of his inner circle allied senior leaders, I think that that is--that is kind of a non-starter for the Iranians, even if they do come to the conclusion that the person himself does not have to stay there forever. Ms. Frankel. Okay. Thank you very much. I yield back. Chairman Royce. All right. Mr. Curt Clawson from Florida. Mr. Clawson. Thank you, gentlemen. Ambassador Benjamin, you have stated that the administration will still be able to rely on U.N. Security Council resolutions that levy arms embargoes against key areas of concerns such as Shia militias in Iraq, Hezbollah, and Lebanon, and in folks in--Houthis in Yemen. Now, Iran does billions of dollars' worth of trade with the Gulf States. They do billions with Europe. No oneis going to stop that unless it is us. I mean, you know, I don't know all the different lists. This list, that list, the other list, the Treasury Department. But I know everybodyis doing business with everybody. And if we were serious and we really wanted to stop it, we would stop it. Last time I checked, we were almost a third of the global GDP. Our trade deficit is $40 billion a month. And a lot of that goes to the people that we would need to cooperate with us from Europe and from that region. And no one can survive without our financial system. No one. If we wanted to stop Iranians enriching themselves, we wouldn't be talking about lists, and we wouldn't be talking about the U.N. We would just say: Hey, anybody doing business with you-all can't do business with us. And that is going to shut your economy down. And anybody taking their money can't do business with our banks, and that would shut their financial access down. It seems to me that this is just some sort of economic charade. I wouldn't depend on the U.N. to shut down the money into Iran. We have a third of the global GDP. Why would we go to the Security Council? If we wanted to stop these folks from getting guns to point at Israel and to point at our allies, we ought to get serious about economic sanctions and economic leverage that we have. And it just always make me irate when we go through these lists when we just allow everyone to trade with these folks. You know we do. You know we do. Are we ever going to get serious about stopping the trade? Because if we wanted to, we are the only folks--now, I know Russia won't, but our friends in Europe trade with them. And so do folks in the region. And we all know it. We just allow it to happen. Are you going to tell me they are not doing trade or that we couldn't stop them? What are you going to tell me here? Ambassador Benjamin. Well, first of all, your points about America's economic power I think are largely on point, and it was because we exercised that economic power that we got the Iranians to the table to negotiate over their nuclear program. What I said about the, and what I testified about the Security Council resolutions, is that they give us the authority under international law to stop certain kinds of trade. So for example, as I mentioned before, weapons from Iran designated for the Houthis in Yemen were seized on the high seas because we had the right under a Security Council resolution. Mr. Clawson. But my question, Ambassador, is why would we outsource our economic leverage to someone else? We have the largest market in the world. I don't want to ask permission from somebody else to use my market access as leverage. We will only get a fraction of our leverage. You are saying that we are making progress by using the U.N. and all these things you are talking about today. It may be a little bit, but why wouldn't we use the full force of our financial system and the full force of our market leverage with everyone that does business with Iran? Because I don't think the U.N. uses the full force of our economic leverage due to our market capacity. Ambassador Benjamin. I am not sure, sir, to what end you want to use all that? Mr. Clawson. To keep Israel safe and our friends from getting killed and thousands or millions of refugees. That is what I would like to use it for. Ambassador Benjamin. Well, I think that history has shown that a mixture of different instruments, diplomacy, sanctions, military pressure, and the like, are the way to go. When we have tried in the past to have far-ranging secondary sanctions, we have had some success, but we also have encountered some very, very serious resentment from our allies, and it puts us in a very difficult position when we want to get other things from them as well. So the policymakers' job is to mix the instruments in a way that produces the desired effect. I think that our European friends if we suggest that we cut off all trade would say that is fine for you but not fine for us. Mr. Clawson. And you know what, I would say that if they wanted to do business in our big box retailers, which they all do, they may not like it; but they will go along. Do the other two of you all have anything to add? On what my point is? Am I off point here in any way? Am I wrong? Am I overstating the case of American power of economic leverage? Mr. Modell. No, I don't think you are overstating the economic leverage we have. I just think we have taken a dramatic shift to doing things in the way that Ambassador Benjamin has laid out in a multilateral sense, and we are not making---- Mr. Clawson. Well, it is not working. It is not working. Mr. Modell. Until the Europeans see that doing business with Iran is not in their interests, and we can't convince them otherwise, I don't see any way of how it is going to go otherwise. Mr. Clawson. I yield back. Thank you. Chairman Royce. Thank you. I thought I would return just with the panel here to a couple of news reports from April of this year. One includes a report from Israel's Security Service, publishing details of information on Hamas' preparation for war with respect to new tunnels being dug, and the Security Service said they had obtained from a Hamas fighter and tunnel digger arrested in that month, he provided a wealth of information on the terror groups' tunnel digging in the Gaza Strip, as well its methods for obtaining cash from Iran for the purpose of digging those tunnels. Iranian support, according to the report, came in the form of cash, weapons, and sophisticated electronic equipment meant to interfere with control signals for drones over the coastal enclave. And then the second report in the Wall Street Journal, according to a senior Western intelligence official, Iran's Revolutionary Guards during the last few months have transferred tens of millions of dollars to Hamas' brigades. Intelligence reports show that the funds have been transferred on the direct orders of General Soleimani, the commander of the Revolutionary Guards elite Quds Force who also directs the annual budget to finance Hamas' military operation. The funds, according to the intelligence reports, are being used primarily to help Hamas rebuild the network of tunnels that were destroyed during the Israeli defense forces response to rocket attacks launched by Hamas, militants from Gaza last summer. So at least one or two intelligence agencies have a different assessment. Just for the record since we had a dialogue on that, Ambassador, I raise that point again. Ambassador Benjamin. I would just say that those reports, so there were signs of rapprochement. You know, Hamas was expelled from Tehran some years ago. There were signs of a rapprochement earlier this year. I believe that rapprochement didn't happen during the summer because of Hamas' extensive meetings with the Saudis. But I am relying here on open source, and I strongly recommend that you request a briefing from the CIA on the subject. Chairman Royce. Well, thank you very much, Ambassador. I appreciate that. And, again, I appreciate the testimony of all of our witnesses here today. And so with that, we will stand adjourned.

Christopher H.\nSmith (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.\nMr. Smith. The subcommittee will come to order, and good\nafternoon to everybody.\nFirst of all, let me apologize for being late. We had a\nseries of four votes and it has disrupted everyone's schedule,\nbut especially yours. So, I do apologize to you for that.\nToday's hearing, examining the consequences of sexual\nexploitation by the United Nations peacekeepers, marks the\nsecond in the series we are holding this year on the critical\nissue of lack of accountability at the United Nations and its\nsubsidiary institutions. It follows our February hearing which\nexposed illicit technology transfers to rogue regimes,\ncorruption at the World Intellectual Property Organization, and\nthe harassment of whistleblowers who sought to redress these\nwrongs.\nIt also follows on the series of hearings that this\nsubcommittee held about a decade ago when we examined\nallegations of sexual exploitation and abuse of minors by U.N.\npeacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the\nneed for true reform that would end the victimizing of the\nvulnerable by those who are supposed to be the protectors. I\nwould note, parenthetically, that as a result of that, we did\nhave Jane Holl Lute, who was then working at the United\nNations, who I think was equally disappointed and frustrated,\ndespite her Herculean efforts, to get the U.N. system to\nrecognize that the peacekeepers, to a person, have to be\nprotectors and never predators.\nSadly, what was happening in the DRC more than 10 years ago\ntoday is repeated in places such as Central African Republic\nand in Haiti. At the time of our hearing on the DRC, I noted\nthat we were there to examine credible evidence of gross sexual\nmisconduct and exploitation of refugees and vulnerable people\nby U.N. peacekeepers and civilian personnel assigned to the\nU.N. peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo.\nThese allegations typically involved peacekeepers' sexual\nconduct with Congolese women and girls, usually in exchange for\nfood or small sums of money. According to the United Nations,\nthese contacts occurred with sickening frequencies and may\ninvolve girls under the age of 18, with some as young as 11 to\n14 years of age. Even more troubling were the allegations of\nrape, forced prostitution, and demands of sex for jobs by U.N.\ncivilian personnel.\nWe will hear from witnesses today who will tell us how\nlittle things have changed and how a culture of turning a blind\neye and covering pervades the U.N. bureaucracy, not just in the\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations, but in the very U.N.\nentities that are supposed to investigate wrongdoing and ensure\naccountability.\nPerhaps even worse still, we will hear from a witness who\nwill tell how in Darfur U.N. peacekeepers stood idly by while\ncivilians were killed by Sudanese militias aligned with the\ngovernment and how the U.N. sought to cover up accurate reports\nof what was happening. This is so horrifying that it brings to\nmind the atrocities that were committed in Srebrenica in 1995,\nwhen Dutch peacekeepers shut their eyes and ears to the killing\nof unarmed citizens, as a matter of fact, facilitated their\ngetting on buses in order to go to their horrific deaths.\nI will never forget, soon after that happened we had the\nchief translator who was there with Koratich and the Dutch\npeacekeeping commander. He lost pretty much the entirety of his\nfamily and couldn't believe the enabling that happened in that\nso-called U.N. safe haven, again, which cost the lives of well\nover 8,000 Muslims. And I have been back to Srebrenica and it\nis a black mark, if ever there was one, on the U.N. efforts.\nWhat compounds the tragedy today is that peacekeeping is\nessential to healing a broken world. The protectors can never\nbe the predators.\nDuring our February hearing on WIPO I noted that a culture\nof corruption has beset the U.N. and other international\norganizations, and how the sexual exploitation of minors\noccurring in U.N. peacekeeping missions transformed ostensible\nemissaries of mercy into envoys of exploitation. I also stated\nmy belief that by shining a light we could help victims, help\nend corruption, bring healing, and, hopefully, true systemic\nreform.\nThat is my hope and desire for today's hearing, which will\nbe a further catalyst to action on the part of this\nsubcommittee, which is why we want to experts to convey your\nbest insights and wisdom to us, that by calling attention to\nwhat is happening will spur reform.\nIt is said that the Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon has\nfinally awakened to the true extent of the corruption and is\ntaking steps to end the culture of impunity and\ndysfunctionality that has characterized U.N. peacekeeping and\nU.N. oversight. I certainly--and I am sure it is shared by our\ndistinguished witnesses--hope that that is true, and that it is\nnot merely cosmetic.\nThe U.N. has laudable and, to be fair, very difficult\ngoals, but we must be steadfast in holding the U.N. accountable\nfor its action and the way the results, good and bad, of the\nU.N. work. American taxpayers provide more support for the U.N.\npeacekeepers than those of any other country and, with that, we\nin Congress bear a fiduciary onus not only to the taxpayers,\nbut also to those innocents in countries who have been harmed\nby the actions more than a few rotten apples.\nI hope that today's revelations and testimony will ensure\nthat the spotlight continues to shine on the U.N. and that, as\na result, what is broken will be fixed and people in need of\nhealing will be given respite from their afflictions.\nI would like to now introduce our distinguished witnesses.\nI do believe we should be joined shortly by Ranking Member\nKaren Bass. When she does come, if you don't mind, our\nwitnesses, I will turn to her for comments that she might have.\nLet me begin, first, with Mr. Brett Schaefer who is Jay\nKingham Fellow in International Regulatory Affairs at The\nHeritage Foundation's Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom. The\nUnited Nations is one of his areas of expertise. He speaks\nfrequently and publishes on issues related to the world body\nand its activities. He regularly addresses business leaders,\ncongressional staff, and academics, has testified before\nCongress before, and has appeared on a variety of radio and TV\nprograms speaking on these issues. Mr. Schaefer joined Heritage\nin 1995 and worked at the Pentagon as an assistant for\ninternational criminal court, a policy from March 2003 to March\n2004.\nThen, we would like to go to Dr. Aicha Elbasri, who was the\nspokeswoman for UNAMID, the United Nations-African Union\nMission in Darfur between 2012 and April 2013. She is the\nwinner of the 2015 Ridenhour Prize for Truth-Telling for\nblowing the whistle on the U.N. coverup of atrocities mainly\ncommitted by Sudan's Government forces, sometimes under U.N.\nwatch. Between 2000 and 2013, she held a number of reporting,\nmedia, and communication positions within the U.N. system in\nNew York, the Middle East, and Africa. Dr. Elbasri is a\npublished author and has contributed articles to various\nnewspapers and magazines in the United States, the UK, France,\nand the Arab Region.\nWe will, then, hear from Mr. Peter Gallo, formerly with the\nOffice of Internal Oversight Services, the United Nations. Mr.\nGallo joined the U.N. in March 2011, where he was an\ninvestigator in the Investigations Division of the Office of\nInternal Oversight Services. Prior to joining the U.N., he\nspent 18 years as an investigator in the private sector in\nAsia, where he was recognized as an authority on money\nlaundering. Mr. Gallo was admitted to the practice of law in\nhis home country of Scotland, Hong Kong, and in New York. He\nhas had a number of articles published on money laundering and\ninvestigations management, spoken at numerous conferences, and\ntaught courses in these subjects as an adjunct lecturer in Hong\nKong.\nWe will, then, hear from Mr. Jordie Hannum who has almost\n20 years of legislative, analytical, and advocacy experience,\nincluding roles on Capitol Hill, political campaigns, and\nwithin NGOs. As a senior director of the Better World Campaign,\nhe guides its legislative and advocacy efforts around the\nsupport for United Nations. During his tenure, he has testified\nin front of Congress on the U.N.'s value, traveled to South\nSudan, researched civilian protection, and written on the\nimportance of U.S. engagement in peacekeeping. Previously, he\nworked on a senatorial campaign, a Presidential campaign, and\nhere in the House.\nSo, welcome to all four of our distinguished witnesses.\nMr. Schaefer, the floor is yours.\nSTATEMENT OF MR. BRETT SCHAEFER, JAY KINGHAM FELLOW IN\nINTERNATIONAL REGULATORY AFFAIRS, MARGARET THATCHER CENTER FOR\nFREEDOM, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION\nMr. Schaefer. Mr. Chairman and other members of the\nsubcommittee, thank you very much for the opportunity to come\nhere today to discuss the problems and concerns with U.N.\npeacekeeping, including recent allegations of abuse and the\nabsence of accountability.\nIn my opinion, it is in the interest of the U.S. to have an\neffective United Nations. For this to happen, the U.N. must\ncarry out its responsibilities competently and effectively and\nefficiently. It must operate in a transparent and accountable\nfashion. It must hold itself and its employees and\nrepresentatives to the highest standards of conduct. This is\nparticularly critical for U.N. peacekeeping where the\norganization sends civilian and uniformed personnel to protect\nand assist the most vulnerable. Unfortunately, the current\norganization falls gravely short.\nFirst, U.N. peacekeeping is being conducted with\nunprecedented pace, scope, and ambition. These increasing\ndemands have revealed ongoing serious concerns and problems,\nincluding poor transparency, mismanagement and corruption that\nhave led to waste, fraud, and abuse in procurement and\ncontracting; negligence and disregard that can lead to\nunintended tragedy such as the introduction of cholera into\nHaiti by U.N. peacekeepers; engaging in partnerships with\ngovernments that are non-democratic, corrupt, or hostile to\nhuman rights; and depending on peacekeepers to defend civilians\ndespite a documented widespread reluctance to respond when\ncivilians under their protection are threatened.\nAll these problems and others should lead to a stronger\noversight by an independent inspector general equivalent in the\nU.N., which is currently lacking, and fundamental reevaluation\nof longstanding operations and those with robust mandates in\nsituations of conflict to ensure that the missions are\neffective within the capabilities and willingness of the troops\nprovided, and achieving their mandates.\nSecond, because the U.N. and its employees enjoy broad\nprotections and immunities, the organization has an extremely\nheavy responsibility to self-scrutinize, self-police, self-\ncorrect, and punish wrongdoing. Unfortunately, accountability\nin the organization has been lacking.\nFocusing specifically on peacekeeping, the most troubling\nproblem is the frequency with which civilian and military\npersonnel prey on the very people that they are supposed to\nprotect. Last year it was revealed that senior U.N. officials\ntried to bury detailed knowledge of abuses by non-U.N.\npeacekeepers in the Central African Republic. Worst, they then\ntried to fire whistleblower Anders Kompass for sending those\ndetails outside the U.N., so they might be addressed.\nA U.N.-appointed independent review panel released a report\nin December condemning the U.N. for ``a gross institutional\nfailure to respond to the allegations in a meaningful way.''\nUnfortunately, the trends for sexual exploitation and abuse\nby U.N. personnel are going the wrong way. In 2014, there were\n80 allegations. In 2015, the U.N. reported 99 allegations.\nSixteen of those allegations occurred in 10 peacekeeping\noperations and involved individuals from 25 different nations.\nThirty allegations involved U.N. personnel in organizations,\nfunds, and programs not related to U.N. peacekeeping.\nLast month, however, the Code Blue Campaign announced that\nthey had learned of 108 new cases of sexual exploitation abuse\nin the Central African Republic. The problem appears to be\ngetting worse, not better.\nThe U.N. has responded to this problem through some much\noverdue transparency in identifying the nationalities of those\naccused and announcing a series of changes in how such\nincidents should be reported, investigated, and addressed. The\nSecurity Council has endorsed the plan, and we have seen\nrepatriation of troops and units with patterns of misconduct\nfor, I believe, the first time.\nHowever, the problem has never been the stated intent of\nthe organization to address these problems. The problem has\nalways been a failure to follow through on those stated plans.\nSpecifically, the U.N. effort hinges on a number of suggested\nchanges that have been ``requested'' of the troop-contributing\ncountries. However, it is far from clear that there is a\ncommitment by the troop-contributing countries to implement and\nadhere to those changes.\nMaking problems worse, the U.N. also seems to have an\nembedded hostility toward whistleblowers who can serve as a\ncritical safety valve for reporting mismanagement and\nmisconduct. The fear of reporting wrongdoing undermines the\neffectiveness and integrity of the U.N., and it must be shored\nup.\nFinally, the methodology for assigning the cost of\npeacekeeping disproportionately shifts the costs away from the\nbulk of the membership and onto a relative handful of high-\nincome countries like the U.S. Specifically, the U.S. is\nassessed over 28.5 percent of U.N. peacekeeping. The least-\nassessed countries pay 0.0001 percent of that cost. For the\npeacekeeping budget, the U.S. is assessed more than 185 member\nstates combined. The U.S. will be assessed over $2.3 billion\nunder this peacekeeping budget. The least-assessed countries\nwill be assessed about $8,300. Nearly 80 countries will be\nassessed a total of less than $100,000, and over half the\nmembership will be assessed less than $1 million.\nThis helps explain why member states are not necessarily\nall that enthusiastic or encouraged to actually conclude\npeacekeeping missions or constrain their costs. They don't pay\nvery much for them, and that leads to a lack of incentive for\nthem to fulfill their oversight role or to pursue budgetary\nrestraint. A long-term solution requires a more equitable\ndistribution of the cost of U.N. activities, so that all member\nstates have this kind of incentive.\nIn conclusion, I want to emphasize the critical role played\nby Congress in U.N. reform issues in the past through the use\nof financial carrots and sticks. In my opinion, Congress can be\na very effective ally of the executive branch in pursuing U.N.\nreform and pressure the organization to adopt the reforms and\nchanges that are necessary and have been illustrated to be far\noverdue with the incidents that we have seen over the past\nyear.\nThank you very much, and I look forward to your questions.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Schaefer follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\n----------\nMr. Smith. Mr. Schaefer, thank you very much. I know you\nhad a much longer version. Without objection, that longer\nversion and those of our other distinguished witnesses, and any\nother materials you would like to introduce into the record,\nwill be made a part of the record.\nMr. Schaefer. Thank you.\nMr. Smith. Doctor?\nSTATEMENT OF AICHA ELBASRI, PH.D., AUTHOR (FORMER SPOKESPERSON,\nUNITED NATIONS-AFRICAN UNION MISSION IN DARFUR, UNITED NATIONS)\nMs. Elbasri. Good afternoon, Chairman Smith, Ranking Member\nBass, and members of this subcommittee. Thank you for inviting\nme to address you today.\nMy testimony will focus on the U.N. coverup of serious\ncrimes committed mostly by the Sudanese Government in Darfur\nbetween August 2012 and April 2013. I would also testify on the\nfailure of the U.N. to investigate these charges which led to\nthe absence of accountability and the perpetuation of the\nDarfur tragedy.\nSoon after I joined the United Nations-African Union\nMission in Darfur, known as UNAMID, in August 2012, I received\na call from a journalist who inquired about reports of violence\nin an area called Tawila in North Darfur. When I checked with\nUNAMID, I was told that the situation was calm. I conveyed this\nline to the journalist, and it turned out to be a lie.\nIn fact, 3 days later, I received reports on the\ndisplacements of hundreds of families in the same area due to\nviolent attacks. I immediately alerted my supervisor, Ms.\nAichatou Mindaoudou, who was the acting chief of UNAMID. Ms.\nMindaoudou ordered a verification mission which confirmed that,\nbetween August 24-26, 2012, government soldiers raided three\nvillages. For 3 consecutive days they assaulted men and\nchildren, raped women and girls, destroyed their farms and\nlooted their properties. This forced up to 5,000 villagers to\nflee for their lives.\nThe government forces attacked these people because they\nsuspected them of supporting the rebels, and they\nsystematically called them, asked them to identify their\ntribes, and reserved the harshest treatment to the Zaghawa\ntribesmen.\nBut UNAMID didn't authorize me to convey any of this\ninformation to the journalist who asked for it. It did provide\nthe Chief of DPKO, Mr. Herve Ladsous, with the confirmation of\nthe Tawila attack, but there was no mention of it in the\nSecretary-General's report to the Security Council covering\nthis period.\nAlthough UNAMID leadership expected me to do as I was told\nand ask no questions, I continued to raise concerns about the\nmission reports. Consequently, I faced censorship and\nhostility, especially from Mr. Karen Tchalian, the Russian\nchief of staff of UNAMID who controlled the flow of information\nwithin the mission as well as the communication with the U.N.\nHeadquarters in New York. But Mr. Tchalian wasn't acting alone.\nHe enjoyed the support of other senior staff, especially the\nSomali Deputy Joint Special Representative for Operations, Mr.\nMohamed Yonis, who is now the Foreign Minister of Somaliland.\nOne example of how information control played out occurred\nafter the Sudanese Government committed a massacre in an area\ncalled Hashaba from September 25-27, 2012. The Sudanese Air\nForce first dropped bombs on the area, and when the bombing\nstopped, a large group of soldiers and militiamen stormed the\narea. They killed and injured people who were trying to escape.\nSoon after the journalists began inquiring about the\nattack, I recommended that the mission issue a public\nstatement, but Tchalian imposed an information blackout, even\nafter the mission saw the evidence of the massacre for\nthemselves. UNAMID established that at least 39 men, 20 women,\nand 11 children were killed in this attack which was carried\nout by the government forces.\nIn addition, Tchalian drafted and compiled a code cable\nthat Yonis signed off on October 7 which distorted the facts\ndocumented by internal reports. They described the attack as\npart of intertribal conflicts over land and resources. They\nattributed the attack to some Arab groups acting in total\nindependence from the government and insisted that the Sudanese\nforces were not involved in the attack. By doing so, they\ncleared the government from responsibility for mass murder.\nWhen I had a conversation with Mr. Tchalian about the\nHashaba attack on civilians, his response shocked me, and I\nquote, ``So what?'' he told me. ``The Americans flattened\nFallujah. Why can't the Sudanese Government bomb its own\npeople?,'' he told me.\nIt was then that I first considered resigning, but my\nsupervisor, Ms. Mindaoudou, convinced me to stay and help her\nchange things and tell the truth. But, within a few months, I\nrealized that there was no place for the truth in UNAMID. The\ninstructions given by Tchalian and Yonis to peacekeepers in the\nfield didn't change. They told them not to report the\ngovernment bombing unless they had seen the craters themselves.\nAs a result, when peacekeepers saw the Sudanese military\nplanes hovering over villages, dropping bombs, and when they\nheard loud explosions and saw smoke, they still couldn't\nconfirm that the bombing took place. Consequently, the\ndeliberate bombardment of civilians would be characterized as\nalleged bombing.\nWhat made the coverup by Tchalian and Yonis so effective\nwas the fact that they were assisted by others in U.N.\nHeadquarters in New York. Even when UNAMID troops witnessed and\ntook photos of civilians being shot about 2 meters away from\ntheir own base, by the time the attack was mentioned in the\nSecretary-General's report the civilian deaths were attributed\nto being caught in the crossfire.\nAnd if you allow me, I can show you just four photos. In\nthis photo, on the morning of September 5, 2012 at 7:45, some\n100 armed government militiamen known as the Janjaweed gathered\naround 2 meters away from UNAMID base near Kutum in North\nDarfur.\nNext. Yes, in this one, this photo shows how UNAMID closely\nmonitored the militias from its base near Kutum throughout the\nmorning of September 5. And you can see how quite close the\nmilitia and the UNAMID forces were.\nNext. At 11:25 a.m., the militia stopped a group of\ncivilians in a truck. They shot dead one man, injured eight\nothers, while UNAMID forces were monitoring and taking these\nphotos. A few days later, two more victims succumbed to their\ninjuries.\nNext, please. Here is the response of the UNAMID. They took\ncare of the dead and the injured.\nNext, please. And here is the real problem. This is how\nboth the Secretary-General reported on the incidents and the\npress release. The reports of Mr. Ban Ki Moon said about these\nincidents that ``the following day one civilian was killed and\neight others were injured in the crossfire of a firefight\nbetween armed militia and government regular forces on the\noutskirts of the town''; whereas, the UNAMID press release\ndescribed this incident on the red line: ``On 5 September armed\nmen alleged fired at the local civilians, resulting in\nadditional casualties.''\nWhile it is true that UNAMID concealed many attacks, it\nkept the Chief of DPKO, Mr. Herve Ladsous, informed of the most\nalarming shifts in the war in Darfur. This is some of what Mr.\nLadsous and others in his department knew and concealed from\nBan Ki Moon's report to the Security Council: First, the\ngovernment violated the Security Council Resolution 1556 by\nintegrating the Janjaweed militias in its own auxiliary forces\ninstead of disarming and neutralizing them.\nSecond, the Sudanese Air Force deployed attack helicopters\nand Antonov aircraft in Darfur, in violation of the U.N. arms\nembargo.\nThird, the government embarked on the second phase of its\nethnic-cleansing campaign which targeted the non-Arab ethnic\nZaghawa population.\nFourth, crimes committed by the rebels included physical\nassault, abduction, looting, and the possible use of the local\npopulation as human shields.\nAnd fifth, the government forces deliberately attacked and\nkilled U.N. peacekeepers.\nBy hiding these facts, DPKO kept the Security Council in\nthe dark, resulting in that body making misinformed decisions.\nAfter 8 months in UNAMID, the vast and systematic nature of\nthe coverup was clear to me. By then, I had reasons to fear for\nmy own safety because of threats made by Mr. Tchalian. I\nresigned, left Sudan, and wrote my end-of-mission report in\nMay. In this report, I asked DPKO to look into the serious\nviolations and concerns I had raised. I received no response.\nSo, in August 2013, I formally requested that the U.N. Office\nof Internal Oversight Services, OIOS, investigate the coverup,\nbut OIOS also failed to investigate.\nBy then, I was working for the U.N. Population Fund known\nas UNFPA, but I knew that I couldn't keep my post if I were to\nexpose publicly what I had witnessed. The U.N.'s awful record\nof retaliation against whistleblowers compelled me to resign\nagain.\nBy April 2014, Foreign Policy Magazine exposed the affair\nbased on the documents I had shared with them. This prompted\nthe International Criminal Court to call on Mr. Ban Ki Moon to\ncarry out a thorough public, independent inquiry. But Mr. Ban\nKi Moon chose to order a dubious review panel that concealed\nits terms of reference, didn't include a single investigator,\nnever set foot in Darfur, and ended up denying the coverup.\nThe Secretary-General commissioned a review that became a\nwhitewash, and no one was held accountable for misleading the\ninternational community and the Security Council. And when the\nUnited States, Britain, and France requested the firing of Mr.\nTchalian, Russia opposed it. Assured of Russia's and China's\nprotection, the Sudanese Government extended its genocide\ncampaign to the Nuba Mountains and beyond.\nThis is today's U.N., an organization that is increasingly\nfailing to bring or keep peace, a rotten system that covers up\natrocities, attacks whistleblowers, lacks accountability, and\npromotes impunity. Since the organization seems under no\nobligation to be accountable, it is the member states' duty to\nact. Therefore, I respectfully request that this committee\nconsider the following reforms: First, establish a truly\nindependent investigative entity that is not part of the U.N.\nSecretariat, but reports directly and separately to the member\nstates.\nSecond, reconsider the leadership of DPKO which has been\nheaded by France since 1997. The best way for the U.S. to\naddress endless scandals in a failing and broken DPKO and\nensure the efficient use of U.S. taxpayers' money is to take\nthe lead of this critical department.\nThird, look into the State Department's certification\nprocess. It continues to certify that the U.N. is implementing\nbest practice whistleblower protections, despite evidence to\nthe contrary, preventing a 15-percent reduction in U.S.\nfunding, according to the law.\nAnd fourth, extend whistleblowers' protection to the U.N.\npeacekeepers police officers, contractors, and victims.\nThank you again for the opportunity to testify today, and I\nlook forward to your questions.\n[The prepared statement of Ms. Elbasri follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\n----------\nMr. Smith. Dr. Elbasri, thank you very much for your\ntestimony and for risking so much, as you have as a\nwhistleblower yourself, and for your recommendations. So, thank\nyou.\nMr. Gallo?\nSTATEMENT OF MR. PETER GALLO (FORMER INVESTIGATOR, OFFICE OF\nINTERNAL OVERSIGHT SERVICES, UNITED NATIONS)\nMr. Gallo. Thank you, Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Bass,\nfor this invitation to testify. I am very well aware it is an\nhonor and a privilege to be here.\nI worked as an investigator in the U.N. Office of Internal\nOversight Services, OIOS, for 4 years from 2011 to 2015. I have\nprovided you the written statement which summarizes my personal\nexperience and which I hope illustrates how accountability\nwithin the U.N. is inconsistent to the point of being\nnonexistent.\nOIOS was established to be independent and to investigate\ninternal misconduct, including sexual exploitation and abuse.\nAnd the member states expect OIOS to do that. But,\nunfortunately, by a combination of assessments of misconduct\ncomplaints by other departments and referrals of cases by OIOS\nto other departments, the reporting of misconduct in the\norganization is manipulated.\nMost of what is reported to OIOS is filtered through an\nentirely separate office within the Department of Field Support\nand Conduct and Discipline, who have no mandate to investigate\nanything, but will assess complaints of misconduct they receive\nfrom field missions.\nThat process often results in those complaints being\ndismissed as lacking in credibility. In practice, these\nassessments also identify witnesses who can then be\ndiscredited, bribed, or intimidated. If the matter must be\ninvestigated by OIOS, by the time the investigators arrive,\nwhich will be 3 weeks later, material witnesses have often been\npaid off, retracted their complaints, or disappeared.\nAlso, rather than investigating many complaints themselves,\nOIOS often refers them to other departments, and often to the\nvery department that has the most to lose if the information\nturns out to be proven true. And I have given you several\nexamples of that in my statement.\nIt is also no accident that the head of Conduct and\nDiscipline, Mrs. Mercedes Gervilla, is married to Michael\nDudley, the Deputy Director of the OIOS Investigation Division.\nNow the U.N. and the Ethics Office see no conflict in this, but\nthe concern is that OIOS will never challenge any assessment by\nConduct and Discipline that is a complaint is not credible. And\nif a complaint about something potentially embarrassing is\nreceived, instead of investigating it themselves, OIOS will\nrefer it back to the Department of Field Support or somewhere\nwhere it can be made to disappear.\nWhat we are seeing with reports of more and more cases of\nsexual abuse by peacekeepers, particularly in the Central\nAfrican Republic, I attribute to one thing, and that is\nattention by the press, particularly as a consequence of the\nCode Blue Campaign. Because of that, reports are being brought\nto the attention of OIOS directly.\nThis press attention began last year with the U.N.'s\nattempt to retaliate against Mr. Anders Kompass for having had\nthe initiative and the integrity to do something about the\nsexual abuse of children. But the Kompass case also\ndemonstrates something else, and that was that Susanna\nMalcorra, who was Ban Ki Moon's chief of staff at the time, was\ntaking the decisions and was driving the investigation and that\nshows that OIOS is not independent. It is actually a resource\nused by senior management for political ends. The term I have\nused in the past is that it was a private gestapo, and I will\nstand by that comment.\nOIOS's credibility has been damaged by that and, also, by\nthe Nguyen-Kropp and Postica case where Deputy Director Dudley\nwas found to have tampered with evidence and then retaliated\nagainst investigators who reported that. The U.N. only took\naction against one person following that case, and I am pleased\nto say that was me. That was not for evidence tampering. That\nwas for making a satirical reference to the evidence tampering\nfrom a whiteboard that nobody saw.\nA couple of weeks earlier, I had reported another OIOS\ninvestigator for what I believe was perjury. That was\noverlooked. The Investigations Director, Mike Stefanovic, was\nsubject to an investigation for a comment he had made 18 months\nearlier about rats in the New York subway. When he tried to\nbring a countercomplaint against the OIOS unit chief for\nreporting that in bad faith and for misleading the tribunal,\nthe U.N. was not interested.\nThe concern is that a U.N. staff member who reports serious\nmisconduct is committing career suicide, and the Ethics Office\nsimply fails to protect them. Now my own experience is detailed\nin the written statement, and I would also draw your attention\nto the Nartey case, when the Ethics Director failed to obey a\ncourt order to protect a staff member. Now that case was doubly\nironic because the official responsible for the retaliation, a\nMr. Barabanov, had earlier been found by OIOS to have illegally\nobtained a U.N. firearm, and the U.N. Director General in\nNairobi had tried to have him disciplined for that at the time,\nbut, instead, it was she who ended up being dismissed.\nThat is the reality of accountability in the U.N. It is\ndependent on who you are and who you know, and maybe a third\none, what you know about who you know. The dysfunction in the\nU.N. cannot be dismissed as a few isolated problems or\nattributed to be a few bad apples. These problems are deeply\ningrained in the culture of the organization.\nNow I can, and I frequently do, laugh about it, but I am\nnot here today because this is funny. It is not a joke for the\nwomen working in the U.N. who are afraid to report sexual\nharassment. It is not a joke for the member states whose tax\ndollars are embezzled and squandered paying for this charade.\nAnd it is most certainly not a joke for the women and children\nraped and sexually exploited with near impunity by the\norganization that they must rely on for their very survival.\nIt is for their sake, and certainly not mine, that I urge\nyou to act and to take control of the investigation of\nwrongdoing by the U.N., because the organization itself has\nproved incapable of policing itself.\nIn closing, I would like to thank the committee again for\ninviting me. And I also have to thank you on behalf of the many\ncurrent U.N. staff members. They appreciate your addressing\nthis issue, but they cannot say so.\nAnd I will be happy to take your questions afterwards.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Gallo follows:]\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\n----------\nMr. Smith. Mr. Gallo, thank you very much for your\ntestimony and for your courage because you have suffered\nretaliation. And thank you for being here.\nMr. Hannum?\nSTATEMENT OF MR. JORDIE HANNUM, SENIOR DIRECTOR, BETTER WORLD\nCAMPAIGN\nMr. Hannum. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member\nBass, for inviting me to appear before the committee today. I\nused to work on the staff of Congresswoman Connie Morella, and\nit is a pleasure to be back on the House side.\nI now work at the Better World Campaign, which aims to\nhighlight the value of a strong U.S.-U.N. relationship. But, as\nyour subcommittee knows and as some of the witnesses have\noutlined, there is a cancer within the United Nations; namely,\nsexual abuse by peacekeepers.\nThe victims of this abuse are real, as are the\nconsequences. Just 2 weeks ago, a 16-year-old girl was alleged\nraped by a Congolese peacekeeper in a hotel room. Hearing\nhorrendous reports like these from the Central African\nRepublic, it would be natural to demand the withdrawal of all\nU.N. peacekeepers, but this basic instinct to protect needs to\nbe balanced against the good that peacekeepers continue to do\nthere. The U.N. mission in CAR has played a critical role in\nreducing ethnic violence, facilitating democratic elections,\nand fostering the highest economic growth in 15 years. So, the\nquestion is, how do we support the vital work being done by\nU.N. peacekeepers in CAR and elsewhere and at the same time\nimplement meaningful steps to stop sexual exploitation and\nabuse by peacekeepers? We believe if the U.N. is to root out\nthe bad actors, whether they hail from the developed or\ndeveloping world, they must show that their newly-announced\npolicies endorsed by the Security Council will be implementable\nwith unshakeable resolve.\nThis month the Secretary-General took dramatic steps to\nimprove transparency, naming and shaming the nations whose\ntroops are accused of abuses. He has also kicked out an entire\nmilitary contingent over evidence of widespread and systematic\nabuse, again, a first. Though overdue, these actions are the\nright course.\nEven so, these measures will mean nothing unless they are\nactively and consistently enforced. Further, we argue that for\nthose countries where there is evidence of widespread abuse\nthey also should be blocked from joining new missions.\nAt the same time, this does not mean that the international\ncommunity should accept a weak response to conflict and mass\natrocities. Rather, we must demand that more countries shoulder\nthe load. As it stands, there is a shortage of well-trained\ntroops for a growing number of increasingly-complex, dangerous\nmissions.\nThe significant increase in the size and scope of\npeacekeeping missions, together with the near withdrawal from\npeacekeeping by European and American forces, has taxed the\nability of the U.N. to recruit the best-trained and equipped\ntroops. If peacekeeping is to ultimately address sexual abuse,\nthe responsibility must not sit with the U.N. alone. Other\nmember states need to answer the bell.\nThe United States, in particular, can play an important\nrole in the areas of training, accountability, investigations,\nand vetting, as outlined in my written testimony. But I must\nalso say that, as we rightly call out the U.N. for its anemic\nresponse on abuse, we must not lose sight of the overall\nimportance of its missions. The U.N. currently oversees 16\noperations with over 100,000 personnel, the largest deployed\nmilitary force in the world. Over the past several decades,\nboth Republican and Democratic administrations have strongly\nsupported peacekeeping. This is because it can mean the\ndifference between life and death in the places it deploys.\nA 2013 study found that deploying large numbers of U.N.\npeacekeepers ``dramatically reduces civilian killings.'' In\nSouth Sudan, where I know you just were, Congresswoman Bass,\nU.N. forces are currently working to protect nearly 200,000\ncivilians. In CAR, Amnesty International just released a report\nsaying U.N. peacekeepers have ``saved many lives and prevented\nmuch bloodshed.''\nIn addition, these missions are much less expensive than\nU.S. forces and have the strong support of our military.\nAdmiral Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs under\nPresidents Bush and Obama, said, ``U.N. peacekeepers help\npromote stability and are very much in our national interest.''\nNow it is true that the U.S. pays the largest portion of\nthe U.N.'s peacekeeping budget, but we also wield veto power\nover the size of that budget due to our presence on the U.N.\nSecurity Council. That special status also puts the U.S. in a\nunique position to push for peacekeeping reform.\nI would further argue that we are best able to pressure the\nU.N. for changes when we are fully engaged and paying our dues.\nAs a result, we have been able to move forward many important\nreforms at the U.N. Of most relevance, in March the U.S.\nchampioned and the U.N. endorsed several of the stringent new\nabuse measures I have just discussed.\nIn addition, U.S. engagement at the U.N. has led to vital\ncost-cutting reforms, including reducing the cost per\npeacekeeper by 18 percent and the number of support staff by\n3,000. Thus, if we are to eradicate the cancer within the U.N.\nright now, it is more important than ever that we remain fully\nand dutifully engaged. Only then can we ensure that the scourge\nof sexual abuse and exploitation can be eliminated.\nThank you.\n[The prepared statement of Mr. Hannum follows:]\n----------\nMr. Smith. Thank you very much for your testimony and\ninsights.\nLet me begin with some questions, beginning, first, if I\nwould, with Dr. Elbasri. The whistleblower protections that you\nhave outlined, Congress, in 2014 and 2015 did pass into law.\nAnd WIPO is pretty much the one, and they don't derive their\nmoney from us in terms of percentage of our giving. It is from\nother sources. And that was brought out very, very clearly in\nour hearing just a few months ago.\nWhy do you think the administration has not tried, or has\nit applied the 15-percent withholding to some of the other\nagencies? And others might want to jump in on this. Because it\nseems to me, when you have a penalty and you fail to use it, it\nis the victims that are the ones who are hurt. That includes\nvictims within the U.N. system itself who would like, as Mr.\nGallo said, to speak out, but, obviously can't because there is\na fear of retaliation. Is there an enforcement problem on the\npart of the U.S. in terms of applying that law?\nSecondly, when we heard of the allegations, and they turned\nout to be true, of rape and horrific sexual abuse of young\nchildren in DR Congo, not only did I go there, I went to Goma,\nmet with the peacekeepers, met with the government officials\nthere, but I also held a series of hearings. We got ironclad\npromises from the United Nations. Kofi Annan issued his zero-\ntolerance policy, which looked fabulous on paper. By the time\nwe got to the third hearing in the hearing series, we dubbed\nthat hearing ``zero-tolerance, zero-compliance'' because it was\njust not being implemented at the tactical and the operational\nlevel.\nSo, I am hopeful that Ban Ki Moon is serious, but you are\nonly as good as your chain in command. It would seem--and your\nrecommendations, all of you, on this would be very helpful--if\nOIOS is not independent, as you have said, Mr. Gallo, that is a\nhuge chink in the armor of protection.\nIt seems to me that there ought to be prosecutions of those\nwho commit these terrible crimes, and naming and shaming, that\nlasts for a day and, then, the country moves on. There is a\nwhole lot of naming and shaming going on at the U.N. all the\ntime, but it doesn't have any impact.\nI think disqualification might be a more apt way of\ncountries or brigades, or whatever, certainly individuals, and\nthe maintenance of a list of people, so others don't get on the\nlist again and end up 5 years later being deployed to recommit\ntheir abuse.\nSo, if you could speak to that? How do we get the OIOS to\nbe independent again? The enforcement of the U.S. law, how do\nwe make that better? Again, a sanction that is not implemented\nis a paper promise that becomes very weak and, then,\nnonexistent in reality.\nThe cholera issue, Mr. Schaefer, thank you for bringing\nattention to that. Some of you might want to speak to how well\npeacekeepers are vetted in terms of health to ensure that\ncommunicable diseases are not brought with them to\nextraordinarily vulnerable populations whose immune systems are\nnext to nil who could pick up those diseases, like what\nhappened in Haiti.\nI have other questions, but that is an opening. Yes?\nMs. Elbasri. Thank you. Thank you for these questions.\nRegarding the first one, which is the reduction of 15\npercent of the U.S. contribution and the law that passed\nregarding this issue, it hasn't been implemented widely because\nthere is a problem with the U.S. Department of State\ncertification process. What happens is that, so far, since the\nlaw has been adopted 2 years ago, the only case that we have is\nthe WIPO case. But many organizations, including the Government\nAccountability Project, documented ample evidence that shows\nthat the U.N. is not abiding, is not complying with the\nimplementation of best practice whistleblower protections.\nThere are many cases that can be communicated to you, drawn\non this issue. So, we are wondering why the lack of\nimplementation of best practice whistleblower protections is\nnot documented in this certification process. So, I think it is\nthe mechanism, that there is something wrong with the mechanism\nhere that needs to be looked at. So, this is the first\nquestion.\nRegarding the issue of rape and the zero-tolerance policy,\nI think what we hear about right now is the tip of the iceberg.\nMost of the attention is directed toward the troops, the\ncountries that are contributing the troops, but the problem is\nmuch wider than that. We are talking about civilians. Local\npopulations, being raped and sexually abused by the\ninternational peacekeeper police forces, by also the civilians\nwithin the missions. And we are not hearing the U.N. talking\nabout this.\nThere is a very important report that came out in 2013\nwhich clearly said that the information we have, really it is a\ndrop in the ocean. Why? Because of this huge reporting\nmechanism, there are problems with the reporting at the U.N.\nand this is across the board, absolutely. And this is across\nthe board.\nThis is not limited to the DPKO. This is a problem within\nevery agency I have worked with. I noticed the same problem.\nThe U.N. is not telling the truth about the reality. It is not\ntelling the truth about the misconduct of its own troops. It is\nseeing things, but not saying it. And the whole problem starts\nthere. If you are not telling the truth, there is nothing you\ncan address later on. You will be basically just addressing the\nsurface.\nMr. Smith. Since you were so much involved with it, why the\ncoverup of, as you pointed out, the hundreds of Sudanese\nsoldiers, up to 150 military vehicles raided three villages,\nand then, you went on to describe the terrible consequences of\nthat? Why cover that up?\nMs. Elbasri. Well, that is exactly what I wanted, a truly\nindependent inquiry. I wanted to see why. I mean, there are\nspeculations. I can only guess that there are some people at\nthe level of the leadership of the mission who have some\nagendas other than the U.N. agendas and the mission. I hope\nthat there will be an inquiry about this.\nBut there is also a culture at the U.N. to cover up. People\ncover up for different reasons, for saving the image of the\nU.N., for not embarrassing themselves, for keeping their jobs;\nalso, for the partnership with dictatorship regimes. There are\nso many reasons for the coverup that need to be addressed.\nSo, talking about certain problems and referring to the\nvery few bad apples, I think we are not helping the U.N. by\nadvancing such a diagnosis. The problem is systematic. It is a\nsystem problem, not a person problem. It is the U.N. is broken\ntoday, and addressing an issue has to start with the truth\ninstead of assaulting truth and going hand in hand with the\ncoverup. The U.N. should be the first to promote truth and\ntruth-telling and promoting the truth-tellers instead of\nassaulting whistleblowers.\nMr. Smith. Can I just ask--and all of you might want to\nrespond to this, in addition to the original questions--are\nthere instances of individuals, once repatriated, that were\nprosecuted and got significant jail time for their crimes\nagainst children and women and other vulnerable people?\nMs. Elbasri. I think there were a few cases in troop\ncontributing countries. I believe it was India. But it is\ninsignificant if you compare that, of course, with the number\nof the allegations.\nAnd I just want to touch on the independence of the U.N.\nHonestly, we don't have time, actually, to hold ourselves with\nsome illusions. OIOS will never be independent because it\nreports to the Secretary-General; it reports to the U.N. Any\norganization that doesn't report directly and separately to the\nmember states will never be independent.\nThank you.\nMr. Gallo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nOn the subject of the 15-percent budget withholding, I\nthink it is important to realize that in the 12 months after\nthat was passed the United Nations Appeal Tribunal decided the\ncase of Wasserstrom. Mr. Wasserstrom was seriously retaliated\nagainst over a number of years. The significance of that appeal\ncourt decision was that, because of the way that the\nregulations were written, which is ST/SGB/2005/21, what should\nhappen is that, when the staff member applies for whistleblower\nprotection, the Ethics Office makes a recommendation to the\nSecretary-General that he be protected accordingly.\nThe Appeals Tribunal decided that, because it was only a\nrecommendation that the staff member did not have a legal right\nto challenge the decision of the Ethics Office. That basically\nmeans that whistleblower protection is a privilege and not a\nright, and it is a privilege which is dependent on, if you\nlike, the grace and favor of the Secretary-General, which\nessentially means the 38th floor, which is essentially the\npeople you are requiring the protection from. From memory, I\nthink that came out halfway through 2014, and I have certainly\nnot heard of, I have not seen any documentation, I have not\nheard any rumors of revisions to the legislation.\nThe example I have given you in the written statement, in\norder to get whistleblower protection in the U.N., you require\nsomething called a protected act, which is essentially making a\nreport of misconduct or cooperating with an audit or\ninvestigation. Now, in my case, I applied for whistleblower\nprotection, and it was rejected on the grounds that the\ncomplaint which I had made did not contain evidence.\nWith respect, the wording of the regulation says\n``information or evidence.'' My complaint was 2,000 words long,\nreferred to a specific email on a specific date by a specific\nperson, which I claimed was coercion.\nBut the point is that all the Ethics Office has to do is\ndismiss that on grounds of credibility and that it does not\nappear to support a reasonable belief that misconduct has\noccurred, in which case that disables it. It can, then, deem to\nbe not a protected act and, consequently, no whistleblower\nprotection applies.\nThe authority on the statistics for whistleblower\nprotection lies with the Government Accountability Project who\nI believe worked out the statistics at the time that it was\nsomething of the order of like 1 percent of applications for\nwhistleblower protection were granted. Okay?\nMr. Smith. Anybody else? Yes?\nMr. Hannum. Thank you.\nSo, just a couple--on the whistleblower point, we will just\nway that we, the witnesses here have made some excellent points\nthat certainly our organization has supported, and I know some\nU.N. officials have said there are key whistleblower reforms\nthat need to be made. One, lessening the onus on the\nwhistleblower themselves, one providing more confidentiality,\nand, three, also increasing the personal liability toward\nsomeone who retaliates. We absolutely support those.\nI just want to make a general point, though, on withholding\njust in general, the concept, because it was mentioned in\ntestimony, and it has certainly been mentioned before that this\nis the way that we are going to get things done--that we should\nwithhold funds to the U.N.\nIn general, Democratic and Republican administrations have\nbeen opposed to withholding as a way to advance reform. In\n2005, the Hyde bill, a centerpiece of that was withholding\ndues. The Bush administration was opposed to it ``because it\nwould detract and undermine our efforts to change the U.N.''\nIn 2011, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs held a\nhearing where George W. Bush's Ambassador Mark Wallace, who was\nthe Representative for U.N. Management and Reform, said that it\nwould not be ``wise or beneficial to use withholding funds to\nimplement change.''\nCertainly, we believe that the best way to advance change\nis to pay our dues, but, then, to be at the table and pressure\nthe U.N. and use our diplomatic leverage. And we have seen the\nbenefits of that over the past few years. If you look at the\nSecurity Council Resolution on sexual exploitation and abuse,\n2272, that was written by the United States, it called for\nthings and endorsed the Secretary-General. And many member\nstates were opposed to it. But because of our good standing and\nour leverage, we were able to advance it.\nAs I mentioned in my testimony, there have been a number of\nimportant cost-cutting reforms. There were major changes pushed\nby the U.S. Mission this December to changes in how staff\nsalaries are calculated. This could lead to hundreds of\nmillions in savings. And again, that doesn't happen if we are\nnot there at the table in good standing and, then, to say,\nlook, we are here, but now we are asking for these changes. I\nthink that is why it is important.\nI think in terms of sexual exploitation and abuse, what the\nSecretary-General has called for, the naming and shaming,\nkicking out countries, that is absolutely critical and it is\nsomething the U.S. has supported. I think it is extremely\nimportant.\nI also want to address the question on jail time. So, that\nhas been a major problem with the U.N., but I would also say\nother armies in terms of just the overall investigations, I\nthink, of the investigations which have been found to be\nsubstantiated. Only in 55 percent has there been any type of\ndisciplinary action. That is something in our testimony that\nwould call that the U.S. really needs to use its bilateral\npressure on countries.\nBut I would say, sadly, this is a problem for major armies\nand countries. In terms of the French troops and in CAR there\nhas been no accountability for what the French troops have\ndone, no punishments yet.\nAnd I saw just a few days ago a report in terms of the U.S.\nmilitary. It was actually looking at Japan, but these were DOD\ndocuments showing that hundreds of cases of U.S. personnel,\nalmost no personnel went to prison, and in 30 cases all they\ngot was a letter of reprimand. And this was for rape and sexual\nabuse. So, this is a major problem, but not just for the U.N.\nMr. Smith. Thank you.\nMr. Schaefer. Thank you.\nI think you were asking why the administration doesn't hold\norganizations to account for failure to fully implement\nwhistleblower protections or to enforce the standards that they\ndo have. Mr. Hannum laid out quite well the mindset, which is\nwe don't want to upset the apple cart; we don't want to ruffle\nfeathers in the organization.\nOftentimes, what happens is the U.S. administration,\nRepublican or Democrat, will have very specific, often\ncontroversial policy objectives that they want to achieve\nthrough the organization. In that calculus reform of the\norganization frequently comes second. That is the way it works.\nThey have a policy agenda. They want to achieve that. Pursuing\nreform of the organization, whistleblower protections, and\nother changes will perhaps upset other member states and lessen\nthe ability for us to get the policy objectives done.\nAnd that is actually why Congress has a role here. Congress\ncan provide perspective and instructions on reform through\nlegislation that would require and assist the administration to\nfocus--and it doesn't matter whether it is Democrat or\nRepublican--on achieving some of these fundamental\ninstitutional reforms.\nI will point out that OIOS actually was established because\nCongress was threatening to withhold money in 1994. There was\nno inspector general equivalent at all in the U.N. organization\nuntil the U.S. withheld money, and we withheld it because of\ninstances of waste, fraud, and abuse that the Congress at that\ntime thought were unacceptable. That threat of withholding\nresulted in fundamental change. And the OIOS, although remains\ninadequate, wouldn't have existed at all without Congress.\nSecond, on the sexual exploitation and abuse and the\nSecurity Council Resolution, if you take a look at that\nresolution, it urges member states to do things. It calls on\nmember states to do things. It requests member states to do\nthings. It does not instruct the member states to do anything,\nthe troop-contributing countries. It is not a binding document\nthat forces troop-contributing countries to do anything. It\nasks them to.\nAs we have seen in the past, what happens in these\ninstances is that the U.N. does just enough to deflect\nattention away from the scandal and the press attention long\nenough for the eyes to go somewhere else, and then, we don't\nsee the follow-through.\nThe U.N. has had a zero-tolerance policy on sexual\nexplotation and abuse for over a decade now. And yet, here we\nare having this hearing, talking about the exact same problems\nthat led to that zero-tolerance policy back then. It is a lack\nof follow-through.\nWhen you have requests from member states--the Secretary-\nGeneral's report is like this, too--it has lots of ambitious\nplans, lots of agendas in there that are in development that\nhave yet to be concluded, that are projected to be implemented,\nthat request the member states to do X, Y, and Z, but it\ndoesn't actually require them to do that.\nI am sorry, there was another question. Oh, OIOS\nindependence, that is a fundamental problem. The Office of\nIndependent Oversight Services, the lack of independence,\neverything has to go through the bureaucracy. When you are\nreporting on the actions of the bureaucracy, yet you have to\nreport through the bureaucracy, that is not an independent\nsystem. You can't expect it to operate in an independent\nfashion under that scenario. It doesn't have an independent\nbudget. Therefore, it has to go through the regular system for\nresources, which is very problematic. That needs to be fixed.\nI would also suggest--and I make this suggestion in my\ntestimony, I believe--that the U.S. State Department should set\nup a separate IG unit in the State Department's IG Office to\nlook specifically at international organizations like the\nUnited Nations. We are the largest contributor to those\norganizations. We have a very strong interest in making sure\nthat taxpayer funds are used well there. I think that we should\nset up a dedicated unit to look into not just peacekeeping, but\nthe U.N. system as a whole and have a series of experts set up\nthere to do that.\nThank you very much.\nMr. Smith. Thank you.\nMs. Bass?\nMs. Bass. Thank you very much for your testimony and, also,\nfor your courage, all of the panelists.\nI wanted to ask some questions and really kind of focusing\non what are the solutions. I always have difficulty with the\nidea of the U.S. withholding money, though, because to me it\nseems like that just increases the resentment of the U.S. So, I\nam not really sure how that produces reforms.\nBut my colleague here, Mr. Chair, was just mentioning how\nin hearings that have been held before, then all of these\npromises were made and never really enforced. I was wondering\nif the U.S. has continued to raise that within the U.N., and\nare there promises that the U.S. could participate in a\nhearing, too? So, kind of where do we fall in those lists of\npromises?\nAnd when you mentioned more countries sharing the load, and\nI looked at the numbers for the European countries, how they\nhave gone down dramatically, have we, the U.S., raised this\nwith the EU?\nSo, those are a couple of questions that I would like to\nstart with. Then, I have some other questions. I guess I am\ndirecting it to Schaefer and Hannum.\nMr. Schaefer. Thank you.\nYes, the U.S. raises these issues a lot of times. It raises\nthem in the Security Council. It raises them in statements when\nthe missions come up. It raised them when these press incidents\nhappen that bring issues and problems to light. The U.S. makes\nstatements and says we need to address this; we recommend that\nwe do X, Y, and Z.\nAgain, the lack of institutional follow-through and embrace\nof those recommendations or the failure of the organization\nitself to implement what we are calling for is habitual.\nMs. Bass. Within the----\nMr. Schaefer. And I will give you a specific example of\nthat.\nMs. Bass. Hold on a second. Within the U.N.'s governance\nstructure, because I am not familiar with it, is it possible\nfor there to be a resolution----\nMr. Schaefer. Sure, sure.\nMs. Bass [continuing]. Demands, that requires that?\nMr. Schaefer. Yes. There are two different ways to do that.\nOne, in terms of U.N. peacekeeping, the Security Council can\nissue a binding resolution instructing all the peacekeeping\noperations how they should conduct themselves and how they\nshould conduct their treatment of troop-contributing countries.\nThe General Assembly is the legislative body that, in\nessence, instructs the Secretariat on its rules, and the\nGeneral Assembly can pass a resolution telling the Secretary-\nGeneral and the Secretariat how to address various matters in a\nvery direct way.\nMs. Bass. So, has the U.S. attempted to do that and it has\nbeen vetoed by the Security Council or have we not attempted\nto?\nMr. Schaefer. Generally, to get something through it will\nbe watered down, as Mr. Hannum mentioned the resolution that\nthe U.S. offered on sexual exploitation and abuse earlier this\nmonth. Egypt voted against it. They didn't want even the weak\nstandards that were included in that resolution to go forward.\nAnd it is generally a negotiating process. You do have to\nget a certain number of countries to support it, and you also\nhave to avoid a veto by the five permanent members to get that\nresolution through in the Security Council.\nIn the General Assembly it is even worse. I mean, you have\nto get a majority of the General Assembly to support it, and a\nlot of those countries either aren't interested in\nwhistleblower protection policies, for example, or in terms of\nthe sense of troop-contributing countries, many of them are\nmajor troop contributors. And so, they don't want to have the\nstandards put into place by the General Assembly that they,\nthemselves, may oppose domestically.\nMs. Bass. Okay. Thank you.\nMr. Hannum?\nMr. Hannum. Thank you.\nYes, a couple of things just in terms of demands. Our\nDirector Peter Yeo just put out an op-ed the other day in The\nLA Times talking about--it is called ``No More Rapists in\nPeacekeeping.'' It was quite blunt.\nBut the importance of certainly what the Secretary-General\ndid in naming and shaming, kicking out countries. But what will\nbe critical going forward is to hold firm there, that countries\nwith widespread and systematic abuse are not allowed back in,\nthat this is absolutely essential and the Security Council\nneeds to back it.\nNow, in order for this to be successful, part of the\nproblem is peacekeeping operations have been a lot larger, a\nlot more complex, and a lot more dangerous. In places like CAR\nand Mali, when there are demands, the international community\nis saying there is a crisis happening right now, there are not\nthat many countries that raise their hands. And so, the U.N.\ncan sometimes be in a difficult situation.\nSo, a year from now, when there is a crisis, where there\nwill be--Burundi or you name it--the U.N. needs to hold firm\nand say countries with a bad record cannot come in, but there\nalso needs to be other member states who can fit the bill, who\nare well-trained and well-equipped.\nYou are exactly right, the EU 20 years ago we were at 40\npercent of peacekeeping troops. Now that is 6 percent. The U.S.\n20 years ago was about 700 troops. They are now at 70.\nAnd so, I think the U.S. can help here. It made very\nimportant strides with the leadership summit last September at\nthe U.N. General Assembly. That was important. There were\n40,000 pledges for that. So, I think it will be critical for\nthe U.S. to push countries to make that those pledges\nmaterialize; also, to make sure that countries are actually\nraising their hands for CAR and Mali. So, these things are\nnecessary.\nBut I would make one other point, just in terms of, well,\nwe should just demand this and we should demand that. And we\ncan talk about how much the U.S. pays. That is true, but the\nU.S. does not provide that many troops. They are for the most\npart provided by the developing world. And as I said, these\npeacekeeping operations, this is not what it was 20 years ago.\nThis is not observing a ceasefire. This is going into a place\nlike Mali, which is the frontline on the war on terror, South\nSudan, where the government is actively targeting you, and\nasking people to go to someone else's civil war and potentially\ndie. In Mali, 60 peacekeepers have died in the past 18 months;\nthree more died today. These are very dangerous places.\nTo just go in and say, ``I need you to do this, this, and\nthis,'' that is not going to play particularly well. That\ndoesn't mean we take a soft touch and do nothing. We should\nabsolutely use our leverage. But, at the same time, to get buy-\nin, we need troop-contributing countries to actually want to do\nthis. And if we are simply demanding things and, then, saying,\n``Oh, well, the U.S. is doing this,'' you create a north/south\ndivide.\nSo, we need to also be able to work with countries because\nthese peacekeeping missions are increasingly dangerous and\ndifficult, and we need well-trained, well-equipped troops to go\nthere. If we are making all sorts of demands without particular\nsupport and working with countries, then we are going to find\neven fewer troops and it is going to be even more difficult to\naddress atrocities when they arise.\nMs. Bass. Well, I was in South Sudan just a couple of\nmonths ago in November. I went there to see the peacekeeping\nbecause I had not seen that before. I was extremely impressed\nwith the people that were there, the people that I met. And it\nwas very clear it was dangerous. As a matter of fact, I think\nthe month before I was there several of the peacekeepers had\nbeen taken hostage. They were released eventually, but it\nwasn't like they were just sitting back and watching.\nOne of the things I worry about is some of the countries\nlike Burundi, for example, that contribute troops to\npeacekeeping, it seems like it is a way to deal with the\nemployment issue in these countries. And so, I worry about\nthat.\nI wanted to know what the role is with the AU. So, we\ntalked about the EU. What is the role with the AU in terms of\nthe accountability and, also, increasing the number of troops\nthat are contributed by AU countries?\nMr. Hannum. Yes. Thank you.\nIn terms of the AU, there are a couple of hybrid missions.\nUNAMID is one. The mission in Somalia is another; the UNAMID\nmission supported by the U.N.\nAnd there is potential, there is promise in some cases to\nsay you have got troops who are closer to the action who should\nbe there. I think Dr. Elbasri could say that there are\ncertainly issues with the AU troops, and there was a paper just\nthe other day by Paul Williams talking about some of the\nproblems with AU troops, the accountability, training. So, it\nis certainly worthy of consideration, but it is not a magic\nbullet by any stretch.\nMs. Elbasri. Thank you. Thank you for this question, a very\nimportant one.\nRegarding the AU, I can just share with you what I saw.\nWhat I saw there is a huge discrepancy between African\ncountries. Between 2012 and 2013, the nations that were\ncontributing the largest troops were Rwanda followed by\nNigeria. If you compare the troops between these two countries,\nyou end up really asking questions whether they were both\nAfricans. The Rwandan troops were known for being well-trained,\nwell-equipped, disciplined; whereas, the Nigerian troops had\nall kinds of problems.\nI saw with my own eyes peacekeepers with holes in their\nshoes, peacekeepers who actually didn't know how to hold the\nweapons, peacekeepers who were not trained at all. And there\nwere jokes in the senior management meetings about cooks being\nrecruited as peacekeepers.\nSo, there are all kinds of problems with the African Union\ncountries. As you said, there is an employment issue because,\nas you know, each country that contributes a soldier makes\n$1,000 a month, and you just have to multiply those by the\n1,000 troops they send.\nSo, there isn't a commitment from every single country.\nEvery single nation is sending troops for a reason, political\nor an economic reason. But one thing is certain. In general,\nthere is a huge problem of performance, lack of equipment, lack\nof training, and lack of command.\nThe main problem that was faced by UNAMID is the fact that\nthe battalions in the field were not responding to the command\nof UNAMID. They were requesting the command of their own\ncountries, and there were a couple of countries that were not\nabiding by the command of the force commander in UNAMID. And\nthat is something that is not unique to UNAMID. It is a problem\nthat has been witnessed in almost every single mission.\nSo, it is extremely difficult to work within a unified\ncommand. But, as far as the African Union troops, there are\nhuge problems, capacity problems, political problems, and also\nperformance problems. And probably UNAMID is one of the best\nexamples one can give.\nMr. Schaefer. If I could just follow up on that one last\npoint, which is the compensation for the peacekeepers, it is\nabout $1,400 per month right now. And there are strong economic\nand, also, just practical reasons for troop-contributing\ncountries to contribute there.\nFirst, they often make more money through the compensation\nper troop from the U.N., which is $1,400 a month, roughly, than\nthey do for the cost of the peacekeeper themselves. And so,\nthat can actually be a plus-up for their own defense budget.\nSending them on peacekeeping operations is a training\nexercise. It can help professionalize them. It can help assist\ntheir efforts to bolster the capabilities of their troops. It\ncan also serve as a way to get practical experience and\ndeployment abroad for their troops. So, there are a lot of\nincentives for troop-contributing countries to engage in U.N.\npeacekeeping.\nAnd I think it is naive to think that if you just expect\nthem and demand that they increase standards for training, if\nyou increase standards for enforcement and investigation on\nsexual exploitation and abuse and other problems, that they\nwould be completely disincentivized from engaging in this\nprocess. There are a lot of benefits to this for the troop-\ncontributing countries, and asking them to increase their own\nstandards I think is a very reasonable ask, and you would not\nsee a lot of troop-contributing countries decide not to\nparticipate in the future if you did that.\nMr. Hannum. If I could just follow up one thing. I mean, to\nbe clear, though, it is true they do it for a number of\ndifferent reasons. The total amount works to about $16,000 a\nyear. But, yes, there are benefits, but in terms of the reality\nof peacekeeping right now, not a lot of countries are raising\ntheir hands to go to CAR and Mali. So, they may do it, but they\nalso may die there. So, the notion that this is just something\nthat they can do because there's trainings--I mean, these\nmissions are increasingly dangerous. The highest number of\nmissions in history right now, two-thirds are in active places\nof conflict.\nSo, absolutely, they do it for all sorts of different\nreasons, but you get what you pay for, too. If we cut this down\nsignificantly, you are going to have more poorly-trained\ntroops. And studies have shown that the worse-trained troops\nthere are, the more problems you have.\nSo, absolutely, by no means are we saying that we shouldn't\npush for reforms. In the testimony I lay out a number of\ndifferent things that we need to do on training. We have an\nexisting framework right now with the GPOI program through the\nState Department. That should be much stronger. That should be\naugmented with more focus on sexual exploitation and abuse.\nThank you.\nMr. Smith. Mr. Cicilline?\nMr. Cicilline. Thank you, Chairman Smith. I, first, want to\nthank you and Ranking Member Bass for calling this hearing\ntoday and to thank all the witnesses for the work that you are\ndoing, for being here today.\nI am very proud to be the co-chair of the Congressional\nPeacekeeping Caucus, which I formed with my colleague Adam\nKinzinger. And we formed this because we recognize the\nimportant role that peacekeepers play in maintaining\ninternational peace and stability and the impact peacekeeping\nmissions have on the United States and our own national\nsecurity.\nBut we also formed the Caucus with the intention of taking\na closer look at the areas that are in need of reform. I think,\nlike everyone else who has learned about these repeated\nallegations of sexual abuse and exploitation against U.N.\npeacekeeping forces around the world, we are all, I think, very\nconcerned about that and really alarmed at the inability of the\nU.N. to effectively prevent this kind of abuse and to hold\nperpetrators accountable when it happens.\nI do think I want to really thank you, Mr. Hannum, for your\ncomments because I do think the notion of sort of disengaging\nfrom the U.N. as an effective way to bring about real reform\nand accountability would be a tragic mistake. In fact, I think\nthis is a moment when we have to deepen our involvement and\nreally engage in an even more serious way. If we are going to\nhope to see any real progress, it is going to require U.S.\nleadership. And so, I think the notion of not paying our dues\nor not playing an active role will make success in terms of\nreforming less likely. And I appreciate your comments on that.\nMy first question really is, it strikes me that, as you\nanalyze where U.N. peacekeepers are and who contributes to\nthem, without oversimplifying it, my sense is that it is the\npoor countries that provide the troops and the affluent\ncountries that supply the money. And it may be that that is\npart of the challenge because it is not surprising that some of\nthe poorer countries don't have the same resources for the kind\nof training and professional development of soldiers that more\naffluent countries might have.\nAnd so, I wonder whether any of you see that question about\nreally training, because we can get to the question about\nwhistleblowers and accountability in a moment, but preventing\nit from happening I think has to be our first focus.\nMy first question really is, is there some role that\nCongress can play that we should be advocating for at the U.N.\nthat will really enhance the professionalization and the\ntraining that is made available to the soldiers who actually\nparticipate in peacekeeping to supplement what poor countries\nmay either not be doing because they can't or not be doing\nbecause they won't? But we will start with that.\nMr. Hannum. Yes. Thank you.\nSo, there are a couple of things. One, I will say that an\nimportant first step, you are exactly right, the dynamic over\nthe past 20 years is mostly countries from the developing world\nwho are providing troops and wealthier nations who are\nfinancing it.\nA key step that happened this September was the leadership\nsummit at the U.N. General Assembly. With U.S. leadership, it\nled to pledges of 40,000 more troops, and China said it would\nprovide a standby force of 8,000. Also, importantly, a number\nof enabling assets like helicopters. So, that was key, and\nthere just needed to be a greater supply. This was a greater\nsupply from a much larger universe of troops. So, that was\nimportant. Making sure those pledges materialize will be key.\nOn the training front, you are exactly right, Congressman.\nThis is an opportunity I think for the U.S. We have an existing\nstructure, as I said, through the GPOI program, the State\nDepartment that has trained over 200,000 peacekeepers over the\nlast decade. But that training is basic. It is a basic level of\ntraining, how to hold a gun. And so, certainly, in terms of\nsexual exploitation and abuse, that should be augmented.\nBut I think one of the other issues is, again, these\npeacekeeping missions are so much different than they were 20\nyears ago, where they were for the most part kind of observing\nceasefires. Now the challenges in Mali are different than what\nthey are in CAR, different than what they are in South Sudan.\nThat training really needs to be tailored.\nAgain, the U.S. is not going to be providing troops anytime\nsoon, but we have such expertise here. I was in South Sudan in\nAugust and just talking with some U.S. troops there. They said\njust what a difference in influx of just a few troops would\nmake just in terms of professionalization.\nBut, on the training side, we should really use these\nexisting structures--this is not a significant amount of\nresources--but use our existing structures to make sure the\ntraining is tailored to where they are going and, then, also,\nit addresses certainly the sexual exploitation and abuse.\nMs. Elbasri. Well, you are right about the general trend.\nIt is the poor countries that are contributing troops and\nricher countries that are paying for the peacekeeping budgets,\nalthough there is a shift I must mention, which is China. China\nis now part of the top 10 contributing countries. It is a major\nchange. They are sending more troops to other countries, and we\nhave seen it now with South Sudan. Basically, they are sending\nthe troops where they have some vested interest to look after.\nBut the question that the European and U.S. contribution of\ntroops has changed has to do with the change in the makeup of\nthe peacekeeping. As you mentioned, quite clearly, the\npeacekeepers are operating in a danger zone, I mean combat\nzones. This is not what peacekeeping is about.\nWe have departed from the three core principles of\npeacekeeping, which is impartiality or neutrality, the non-use\nof force unless necessary, and also the consent of all parties\nof conflicts. We have put that aside since 1999 at least, and\nwe have been sending peacekeepers without doing anything about\npeace. This is a major problem with peacekeeping today.\nToday, if you look at Mali, we are not talking about\npeacekeepers. These are troops, U.N. troops, that are fighting\nterrorism. Most of the countries that know the region, they\nthink that the U.N. has nothing to do with this fight because,\nin doing so, first of all, it doesn't have the capacity; it\ndoesn't have the ability. And we are talking about peacekeepers\nwho are sent to keep peace, not to fight war and let alone\nterrorism.\nYou have a country like DRC, Congo, where the mission has\nbeen mandated to fight rebels. This has never been part of the\nU.N. mandates. You have other areas where you have the\npeacekeepers running after gangs. This is a huge change for\npeacekeeping. It is alarming.\nAnd I can tell you that, as far as I am concerned, when I\nleft UNAMID, I didn't think of myself as a former peacekeeper.\nI thought of myself as a former warkeeper. In Darfur we didn't\nkeep peace. We kept genocide. It is really sad to say that, but\nmost of the peacekeeping missions today, they are keeping wars;\nthey are keeping conflicts running since 1948.\nIf you look at Kashmir, what the U.N. is doing, what is\ncalled generally frozen conflicts. Whether it is Kashmir,\nCyprus, or Western Sahara, these are timebombs. We have seen\nrecently a major crisis in Western Sahara when Mr. Ban Ki Moon\nwalked into the region and, without consulting, without\nvisiting Morocco, and completely it has formed into a major\ncrisis with the polisario, threatening to go back to holding\narms.\nThese are considered frozen conflicts that the U.N. has\nbeen keeping for so many decades, but these are timebombs. I\nthink what I want to say here is that we should go back to the\nU.N. keeping peace, but bringing in peace first in order to\nkeep it, instead of waging wars and keeping wars ongoing.\nThank you.\nMr. Schaefer. I just want to echo what she said about the\ntype of missions that the U.N. traditionally engaged in versus\nwhat we are engaged in today, very different operations, very\ndifferent circumstances. And there should be an underlying\nquestion about whether the U.N. is actually the most suitable\nvehicle for engaging in those types of operations.\nIf you take a look at Mali, when did the U.N. get involved?\nIt got involved after the French intervention. So, the French\ngot in there, they intervened, and, then, they handed it as\nquickly as they possibly could off to the U.N. Well, there\nshould be an expectation that, if the French considered it\nenough in their interest to intervene in the first place, that\nmaybe they should have a responsibility and an interest in\nseeing it through to the point where a U.N. operation actually\ncould responsibly assume those tasks.\nOn longstanding operations, I agree. A lot of these\noperations involve situations that are potentially fractious\nand could reignite, but you also have to question yourself,\nwhat have we been doing? You have a U.N. operation in Kashmir\nsince 1949. You have had Cyprus since the 1960s. You have got\nLebanon since the 1970s; the Syria operation, UNDOF, since the\n1970s; MINURSO since 1991.\nAfter two, three, four, five, six decades, you have to ask\nyourself, when are we going to see progress being made toward\nresolution rather than just keeping the parties from open\nwarfare? We need to be focused on that part of the equation. If\nyou could do that, you would have more resources for current\noperations because the troops that are tied up there could be\nmoved someplace else, and the resources that are tied up there\ncould be moved and applied to more current crises.\nAnd the final question or the final point I want to make is\non U.S. training of peacekeepers. I think the U.S. has a very\nimportant role in training. I think it is very important that\nwe do that. I think it is very important that the U.S., in\nparticular, do that because our standards and our expectations\nare well laid out and it is what we expect. We want to make\nsure that others hear that message and they implement it in\nterms of their own operations.\nBut a key problem, Mr. Hannum mentioned that there are\n200,000 that have been trained under this program. Where are\nthey? There is insufficient retention of the people that we\ntrain. They go in; they go out, or the training lapses and they\ndon't adhere to those standards. Retention is a critical point\nof this.\nIf we are actually trying to make sure that we have\npeacekeepers available that are trained to the standards that\nwe expect, we need to make sure that those peacekeepers are\nactually there, retained and available for deployment. So, that\nis a key element of this that I think needs to be emphasized.\nMr. Cicilline. If I may, Mr. Chairman, one more question?\nOkay.\nSo, there have been a number of suggestions made about\nthings we could advocate for at the U.N., maybe a different\nresolution that makes some of this compulsory rather than\nadvisory. And I think recognizing it is an international\norganization, that may be difficult, but it is certainly\nsomething we should consider, and a number of other reforms\nthat have been suggested and a number of things that I think\nthat we could suggest or press the Secretary-General to do.\nBut my final question is, are there any actions that you\nthink Congress could take to accelerate the reforms that you\nhave all testified today or any other action you would take\nthat would help respond to this very serious problem that we\nsee with respect to the conduct of the peacekeepers?\nIf you had one thing you would recommend Congress to do?\nMr. Schaefer. Well, we have addressed a number of issues\nhere today. OIOS independence is something that we know a great\ndeal about, how to do an inspector general unit and make it\nindependent. OIOS was established because of congressional\nwithholding. I think that we should say exactly what we mean by\nan independent inspector general equivalent there and how that\nneeds to be implemented. I would endorse using financial\nwithholding if the U.N. proves reluctant on that. It is\nobviously necessary.\nIn terms of sexual exploitation and abuse, I think that the\nU.S. should go to the Security Council and demand a compulsory\nresolution saying that troop-contributing countries have to do\nA, B, and C, which they have endorsed and which the Secretary-\nGeneral has endorsed. And if they don't follow through with\nthat, then, again, I think congressional action is merited\nbecause the U.N. is 193 member states, but one thing they do\nlisten to is financial incentives. And we have seen that\nrepeatedly in the past, not just with the OIOS, but with the\nbudgetary process in the 1980s, the Helms-Biden changes and\nreforms, and over and over and again.\nI have spoken with Ambassador Wallace. I know he testified\ndifferently when he was the Bush administration, but privately\nhe thinks that financial withholding has a very significant\nimpact on the receptiveness of various reforms in terms of U.N.\nbureaucratic procedures and changes.\nMs. Elbasri. I think for the U.N. to address all these\nissues, the truth has to come out, which we have seen in my\ncase and almost every case, the OIOS is incapable of carrying\nout independent investigations. So, we would definitely press\nfor a truly independent investigative entity that doesn't\nreport actually to the Secretary-General/Secretariat, but,\nrather, to the member states. I think that is a core\nrecommendation.\nBut, also, I agree with Mr. Schaefer on the financial\nincentive. It is very important to help implement that law\nbecause at some point we have to show that we are serious about\nthe laws that are passed and we are serious about, you know,\nholding the U.N. accountable for mistreating whistleblowers,\nwhich have become the main channel of knowledge/information\nabout what really goes on in the U.N. So, we can't afford these\nretaliations, these continued retaliations against them. It is\nvery important to take action there.\nAnd it is also very important to look at the State\nDepartment certification process to see what is going wrong.\nMr. Gallo. Thank you.\nAnd I would also add my voice to the withholding side of\nthe argument, reluctantly as though it may be, and, also, that\nOIOS has to be replaced with a truly independent body. We have\nbeen focusing on the peacekeeping troops, which present a\npeculiar problem because they are subject to their own national\ndisciplines.\nI would draw your attention to a report which I actually\nworked on, I believe it was the later half of 2013, which was\nan analysis of what was reported to OIOS in terms of sexual\nexploitation and abuse cases. What I found was that the numbers\nof reports were coming in equally, such that they were split,\nmore or less, 50/50 between the civilian staff and the\npeacekeepers.\nNow, in a typical large peacekeeping mission, you may have\n20,000 relatively-disciplined peacekeeping troops and less than\n2,000 civilian staff and police personnel. So, if you are\ngetting equal numbers of reports from there, the problem is, in\nfact, much, much more acute amongst the civilian staff.\nAnd there is something which can be changed and I believe\nshould be changed as a policy decision. That is the waiver of\nprivileges and immunities. The system in place at the moment\nrelies on the privilege and immunities being waived at the end\nof the process.\nWhen OIOS carries out an investigation into a rape, for\nexample, what are they actually investigating? They are not\ninvestigating the rape as a criminal offense. They are\ninvestigating whether that constituted a breach of the staff\nrules for which that staff member may be fired. That can take,\nat the speed at which the U.N. likes to move investigations,\nthat could take 5 years. At that point, and only at that point,\nwill the organization consider waiving privileges and\nimmunities, so that that staff member can be referred to the\nnational authorities for criminal prosecution.\nBy that time, the witnesses have relocated, can't be found.\nThere is no DNA evidence. And where, in fact, is the subject\nhimself? He has separated from the U.N. and has returned to his\nhome country. So, you are giving a problem to a country like\nSouth Sudan; ``Go and apply to the Government of Poland for\nextradition to this guy who no longer lives there and has\nprobably retired to Spain or somewhere else.''\nOne of the things I believe that should be done under a\nreformed investigation agency is that the privileges and\nimmunities should be waived at the point in the investigation\nwhen reasonable grounds to establish that a criminal offense\nhas taken place. At that point, the matter becomes a criminal\nmatter and it can be referred for criminal prosecution.\nThere is still an ongoing role for monitoring for human\nrights abuses and legal defense and everything else that the\nU.N. can do, but, under normal circumstances everywhere else in\nthe world, if you have a conflict between a civil action and a\ncriminal action, it is the criminal which takes priority, and\nthe U.N. is doing it the other way around. If there is a rape\ncase, it should be investigated as a criminal case first.\nMr. Smith. Thank you.\nMr. Hannum. Thank you very much.\nSorry. Just one other point on withholding, since there are\nseveral recommendations. Withholding is not new; it has been\naround. And again, this is something that Democratic and\nRepublican administrations have been opposed to. The Bush\nadministration was very clear when there was a bill. Its\ncentral premise was withholding, and they were against it.\nIn terms of Mr. Wallace and what he said privately,\npublicly I mean he could have said anything he wanted, and\npublicly he said it would not be wise or beneficial to use\nwithholding funds to implement change. So, it is not something\nthat has worked well before. We are best placed if we are\npaying our dues and, then, at the table and pressuring.\nIn terms of your question, Congressman, on what Congress\ncan do, I think the big thing, again, is the U.S. has no\nappetite for the U.S. to provide troops. The U.S. can provide\ntechnical expertise. It can also provide enabling assets. And I\nthink that is key.\nA good example, I was in South Sudan in August and talking\nwith U.S.-U.N. folks, and they were talking about medevac and\ncasualty evacuation. And due to a lack of assets, one of the\nproblems is the U.N. does not have a capability to medevac many\nof its soldiers, meaning someone could go out, be shot in the\nleg, and not be picked up for 4 days. You can imagine in the\nU.S. that would be laughed at, if you couldn't provide medevac\nfor soldiers.\nSo, what this means in practice is, then, there are fewer\nmissions that go out and deploy. And so, you do have this\nhunkering down, which is a major problem with the U.N.\nAnd I asked them, ``Well, what are we talking about?'' And\nthe U.S. person said four helicopters. Four helicopters would\nmake a huge difference in our ability to go out there and\nforward-deploy. That means protect civilians and not just kind\nof hunker down.\nSo, that is something absolutely this is not a huge ticket\nitem, but this is something, I think when the U.S. talks about\nits assistance, it should really look at whether it is\nhelicopters. And there are partnerships with the National Guard\nthat exist where it can be done and vehicles. These are ways\nthat the U.S. could make a big difference.\nMr. Cicilline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nMr. Smith. Thank you.\nJust a few followup questions and final questions. And\nthank you again for your time, your expertise. It really is\nhelpful.\nWe are thinking of drafting a bill, and would invite your\nmaximum input as to what it might look like, to try to\nencourage significant whistleblower reform at the United\nNations. Simultaneous with today, the Foreign Relations\nCommittee on the Senate side, of course, is holding a hearing.\nWe are very, very concerned about this. So, again, any\nparticular thoughts you might have over and above what you have\nincluded in your testimonies and your responses would be\ngreatly appreciated.\nLet me just ask a few final questions. Without objection,\ntestimony, written testimony, by Beatrice Edwards from the\nGovernment Accountability Project will be included in the\nrecord.\nShe points out, very rightly, that whistleblowers are both\nimportant and vulnerable agents of accountability. And on the\nsexual exploitation and abuse in the missions, she points out\nthat allegations are underreported for many reasons, cites some\nof those reasons. She says the official data grossly\nunderestimates the problem and, at worst, they actively\nmisrepresent the entire issue, which is a very, very\nsignificant indictment of the validity of what is happening on\nthe ground.\nAnd then, she points out that cronyism and nepotism is\nespecially pronounced in its oversight offices. These personnel\nconstitute networks through which managers protect each other\nand themselves from accountability. Relatives and friends\noccupy high-level positions where they also avail themselves of\nthe exemptions joined by U.N. officials from external scrutiny.\nYour thoughts on that?\nSecondly, I do believe sanctions should be prudently and\njudiciously applied in our civil rights law certainly and any\nother time we mean business. I am the prime author of the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act, which was opposed, most of\nit, by the Clinton administration, although Bill Clinton signed\nit at the end. But I held the hearings and we heard from\nSecretary Koh, Harold Koh, who didn't even want the TIP Report.\nHe just wanted the human rights reports to have enhanced\nreporting on trafficking, no TIP office, and no sanctions.\nMy belief is--and, thankfully, it was a bipartisan belief--\nwas that you have got to have a penalty phase, particularly in\nhuman rights law, or else everybody will be onboard, but\nimplementation will be less than stellar, if not outright\ndisappointing. Thankfully, we do have a broad consensus now as\nto why the Trafficking Victims Protection Act should be fully\nembraced, including its sanctions regime.\nBut, again, I think--and I take your point--withholding\nshould be used. You would disagree with this, but I think it\ndid get us to the OIOS, I believe.\nI remember when Dick Thornburgh testified in the 1980s, the\nformer Attorney General. I was at those hearings. And he could\nnot have been clearer of the need for inspector generals that\nare robust and independent, which still we are striving in some\nway to achieve, which has not happened.\nSo, you might want to speak to this statement, again, by\nBeatrice Edwards.\nDr. Elbasri, your third point, what would an independent\njudicial body look like? Maybe any or all of you might want to\ntouch on that as well, because I think that should be a policy\ngoal for these whistleblowers, and just to bring accountability\nto the U.N.\nYour fourth point about the U.N. DPKO being run by French\nleaders and the need for reform there, if you could elaborate\non that as well? Obviously, Kofi Annan had that job once, and\nwe have Rwanda. As a matter of fact, I even chaired hearings\nwhen we had the famous fax and Lieutenant-General Dallaire as\nwell, who talked about what could have been, had they only been\nresponsive to what was set before them in terms of an impending\ngenocide in Rwanda.\nBut why that would make a difference? I think you are\nsuggesting in your testimony it ought to be us; it should be\nthe United States perhaps to take that. If you could elaborate\non that?\nAnd then, on military training, in 2003 and 2005, I did the\nreauthorizations of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. We\nput in provisions to provide minimum standards for peacekeeper,\nhow is a country doing or not doing relevant to its military?\nAre they adhering to a code of conduct that does not become\npredatory or facilitating trafficking?\nWe also had language in there dealing with peacekeeping and\nwhat is happening in all of the potential peacekeeping\ndeploying bodies, from NATO to the U.N., to African Union, to\nothers.\nI was in Brazil after our law went into effect. I met with\na number of Brazilian leaders on TIP in Brasilia. I kept saying\nto them, ``What are you teaching your troops before they are\ndeployed?'' So, I finally got the packet, and it was an hour-\nlong ``this is what trafficking is.'' And it was informative;\nit was interesting. But it didn't have the sense of these are\nwhat the victims look like; this is what happens.\nAnd I would say, parenthetically, George Bush did an\nExecutive order. And it actually came about because of a Fox\nNews reporter who literally walked into my office and said,\n``Take a look at this tape.'' And he had pictures of American\nservice personnel in Seoul, South Korea, outside of the so-\ncalled ``juicy bars'' with protection forces outside and inside\nwere indigenous South Koreans, women from the Philippines, and\neven Russia, who told him on camera, ``We can't leave here.\nThey have taken our passports,'' if they were foreigners, ``and\nwe are slaves.''\nThankfully, Joseph Schmitz, the IG for the Department of\nDefense, at our request, did a global assessment focused first\non Kosovo and South Korea and came back with a scathing\nindictment of our own military. And then, Bush did a zero-\ntolerance and changed the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\nNow I say all that because our military gets it. Whether or\nnot they always implement it, I think it is a good record. But\nanything can stand improvement.\nBut we need to share those best practices much more\nrobustly than we do. I think the TIP office is made up of an\nextraordinarily dedicated group of Foreign Service Officers and\nleaders who can share that expertise with countries.\nAnd I am not sure, because I have asked--maybe you have\nbetter insights--does the U.N., does our U.S. Mission in New\nYork really utilize TIP for training, especially of these\npeacekeepers, before, maybe even during, and then, after action\nwith deployment?\nMr. Hannum. Just a quick point there. Mr. Chairman, under\nyour leadership on the trafficking bill, I think you are\nexactly right that this is an opportunity. We should be, in\nterms of the pressure and from what we outlined a little bit in\nthe op-ed, it is that it is troops with widespread and\nsystematic abuse, but we should also be looking at other areas\nand, then, putting pressure on those countries. There are\nwatchlists. There are watchlists that use rape as a weapon of\nwar, children soldiers. We should be using these and making\nsure that countries with terrible track records are not being\npulled into peacekeeping.\nIn terms of the whistleblowing, I will turn it over to\nthese folks who obviously know it better than I.\nMr. Smith. Thank you.\nMs. Elbasri. On the independence of judiciary, the reason\nit was called for by the governments that come to these\nprojects, by other organizations, by many whistleblowers, is\nthat the fact that the judiciary at the U.N. is not working,\njust like other institutions. I think that GAP had documented\nthat over 400 cases, only 4 percent of the cases were\nrecognized by the U.N. as retaliation cases. Even then, nothing\nhad happened. There was no recourse for these whistleblowers.\nSo, it is exactly like the investigation. Whistleblowers\nneed an independent body to look at their case and, also, to\nhave access to independent justice in order to address the\nwrongdoing suffered by the U.N. It is a very important cause.\nThe second issue--and I am glad that you raised this\nquestion, this followup question--about the reason why I\nstrongly believe that the United States should take care of the\nDPKO and take over the French leadership which has started in\n1997. The reason why I am saying this is that I have observed\nand studied the military doctrine under which the peacekeeping\nis operating since then, since 1997. It is not a U.N.\npeacekeeping doctrine. It is a French military doctrine.\nAnd what is the doctrine about? It is about, first,\nrenouncing to the impartiality, which is a very important\nprinciple for the U.N. It is also about reversing the use of\nforce, which used to be limited to self-defense. But, under the\nFrench military doctrine, it is the use of force beyond self-\ndefense. In many cases it is actually an aggressive action.\nThe other principle is sending peacekeepers in areas where\nthere is no peace to keep. This is called, in terms of\npeacekeeping, the gray areas between peace and war. Frankly,\nthese are combat zones.\nSo, what we have witnessed since 1997, when the French took\nover DPKO, is a militarization of peacekeeping. You look at\nevery single peacekeeping mission that was deployed since then,\nsince 1997, and you have two things.\nFirst of all, it is super-militarized. We are no longer\ntalking about blue helmets bringing peace to these areas and\ncomforting the population, observing the ceasefire, et cetera.\nWe are talking about peacekeepers who are going after gangs,\nrebels, siding with governments, and giving up on every single\nprinciple of the peacekeeping.\nWe are also seeing something else. Most of the peacekeeping\noperations that were deployed recently, they were deployed in\nwhat is usually called as ``sphere of influence.'' Well, if you\nare a Moroccan-American national like myself, we look at it as\npost-colonial deployment.\nMost of the people are extremely upset about the fact that\nFrance continues to act like the gendarme of Africa. What we\nhave witnessed since 1997 is a country that is not looking\nafter the interest of the member states of the U.N., but,\nrather, after the interest of France, at the expense of\npeacekeeping in general.\nSo, we ended up, of course, with DRC, the Congo, with the\nregime change, and the U.N. mandates in the Ivory Coast. We\nended up in fighting war that the U.N. has nothing to do with,\nwhich is terrorism in Mali. I think we are actually moving into\na much more dangerous situation if we don't put an end to this\ntrend. People in Africa, countries that are plagued with these\nwars, they don't want to see a former colonial power imposing a\nwill on the population, siding with dictatorships. And what is\nof most interest is that this affects the image of the U.N. and\npeacekeeping.\nSo, it is time for me to see the U.S. really reflect about\n18 years of a French leadership of peacekeeping. It is time to\ndraw a line and say, ``Is this what we want?'' Right now, as\nyou already said, we are sending peacekeepers to combat zones,\nand this is not what the U.N. peacekeeping is about.\nThank you.\nMr. Smith. Go ahead.\nMr. Gallo. Mr. Chairman, you asked about cronyism. The word\nis absolutely. You cannot have senior people in the department\nwho are supposed to be investigating fraud and misconduct who\nhave been found to have retaliated, and been found to tamper\nwith evidence and investigations. You cannot seriously expect\nmembers to report anything to them. It is simply not going to\nhappen.\nThe question of cronyism and everything I believe can be\naddressed by the imposition of an independent body which\nreports. So, you have the investigation agency reporting to the\nGeneral Assembly. That has to be done essentially on a weekly\nbasis.\nYou asked what would such a body look like. The monitoring\nthat it requires to be done is essentially in three areas. One\nof them is in the intake of investigations and the intake of\ncomplaints. Now at the moment we have a very highly-fragmented\nsystem. The previous director, Mr. Stefanovic, made enormous\nefforts himself to try to impose a single portal for receiving\ncomplaints. That is not done. There is no reason why it\nshouldn't be possible in this day and age for all complaints to\ncome into one single point. The system was actually purchased\nand is in place. It is just there is a reluctance to use it.\nThe reason there is a reluctance to use it is because it makes\nit very difficult to make cases disappear. So, the intake of\nthe investigations is something. Of course, the approval as to\nwhat is going to be investigated and what can be bid has to be\nsubject to oversight.\nMr. Smith. Is confidentiality assured or is it compromised\nin cases, if somebody does make a complaint? How sure are they\nthat it is not being shared by email or any other way with\nother people in the building?\nMr. Gallo. I am not sure that is a major problem. I mean,\nit can be, but it is very difficult to answer on a general\nbasis. The reality is in most cases it is fairly simple to\nidentify who the complainant was who is really the aggrieved\nparty. So, there isn't a major investigative activity to find\nout who to retaliate against.\nAs I say, the second issue is the approval of reports as to\nwhat is going forward and disciplined decisions, the decision\nto actually charge someone with misconduct. Now at the moment\nthat is vested in the Assistant Secretary-General of Human\nResources. And, I have seen cases where staff members have been\ninvestigated and found to have received bribes and actually\njust been admonished for it and given a letter and told not to\ndo it again. Well, that is not actually a disincentive for\nanything.\nBut these things can be done, and there is, I believe, a\ncompromise which would, I think, satisfy everyone that the\ninvestigation function can be replaced in such a way that it\ndoes not require grievous withholding of the budget. If you can\ngive me a week or 10 days, I would like to get back to you on\nthat one.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.\nMr. Schaefer. And the issue of confidentiality, I believe\nwith the Anders Kompass case, the Ethics Office was complicit\nin an effort to try to identify him and retaliate against him.\nSo, the independence and the confidentiality was certainly a\nproblem in that case.\nOn the broader issue of resourcing and protection of\ncivilians, the U.N. did a study in 2014 which looked into U.N.\npeacekeeping operations with a mandate to protect civilians.\nAnd they found that, of 570 reported incidences, the\npeacekeepers did not respond in 406, or 80 percent of those\nincidents where civilians were attacked.\nI don't believe helicopters are going to respond or fix\nthat problem. That is a lack of will and a lack of dedication\nor a lack of willingness to put themselves in harm's way to\nprotect civilians on the part of the peacekeepers and the\ntroop-contributing countries.\nMr. Smith. Is that because the mandate is not robust\nenough?\nMr. Schaefer. No, the mandate specifically instructs them\nto protect civilians. So, the instruction is there. The troops\nthemselves do not meet that mandate. Because this was only on\nthose missions where there is a specific instruction from the\nSecurity Council within the mandate to protect civilians. So,\nthis is not a situation where, if only we had better equipment,\nwe would have been able to protect civilians. That is not the\ncase here. This is a case where there is a distinct lack of\nwillingness on the part of the troops to fulfill that part of\nthe mandate, and that is the core of the problem.\nThe troop-contributing countries got together and they said\nin the Kigali Principles, ``We are going to fix this problem.''\nI haven't seen any real evidence that they have fixed it, and I\nwould be really interested to get a detailed report on exactly\nwhat has been done and what the real-world impact of those\nprinciples has been on the missions where this problem was\nreported on the part of the U.N.\nMs. Elbasri. Very briefly, the other reason why these\npeacekeepers who were deployed under what are called the\n``robust peacekeeping missions,'' whether it is in Mali, in\nDRC, or in Liberia, is that they were just not able to be\neverywhere. Most of the attacks took place in places where the\npeacekeepers didn't have a presence.\nAnd this takes us to the other problem. We are giving\npeople the illusion that the peacekeepers can protect\ncivilians, but, in reality, they just cannot. They cannot\nprotect all civilians everywhere and every how. It is\nimpossible. Only a state can.\nPeacekeepers, even if they have the best helicopters in\nthere, they have the best-trained peacekeepers, if they have\nthe best willingness to do so, they cannot be everywhere. If\nyou deploy them in a place like Darfur, they just can't\noperate. Why? Because in order to shoot at the government\nforces, they need to have the authorization from the\ngovernment. So, this is just a surreal situation.\nLook at every peacekeeping operation. In Darfur, it is\nprobably the best example. We are sending peacekeepers to\nprotect civilians from the government which is protecting the\npeacekeepers. It just doesn't make any sense. It is impossible\nfor the peacekeepers to protect all civilians from a government\nthat protects them.\nSo, I think the whole framework of peacekeeping is\ncompletely flawed. It is time to be honest about it. It is time\nto define what is peacekeeping, what the peacekeeping can do,\nwhat it cannot do. They cannot protect all civilians. All the\nhistory that we have witnessed in Rwanda, in Srebrenica, and\nalso in Somalia showed that. Whether the peacekeepers are best\nequipped, the most robust, or if they are weak, you know, not\nprepared, they just cannot protect all civilians. That is why I\ngo back to what I said. What we need is peace before\npeacekeepers.\nThank you.\nMr. Hannum. If I could just make one other point, Dr.\nElbasri and Brett made some very excellent points and\nfundamental points about peacekeeping. And there is a host of\nchallenges, and there was a major report just done by the U.N.,\nthe high-level report calling out some of these.\nAnd there are challenges with protection of civilians. But\nI do want to point out that there have been studies looking at\npeacekeepers and protection of civilians. There was a 2013\nstudy by American researchers and Swedish researchers that\nlooked at this, and looked at what is the difference between a\nforce not there, a small force, and a sufficiently-large force.\nAnd it found that if there is either a small force or no force,\nthat it works out to about 100 civilians a month who are\nkilled. If there is a U.N. force of 8,000, that number goes to\ntwo a month.\nU.N. peacekeepers are not perfect by any stretch, but they\ndo often serve an incredibly important role on protection of\ncivilians. And there have been a number of other studies about\nreducing incidents of civil war. So, while it is not perfect, I\ndo want to say that many peacekeepers do serve honorably and\nmake a huge difference in the places where they are deployed.\nMr. Smith. When you talked about reporting to member states\nas opposed to the 38th floor, in our WIPO hearing it was made\nabundantly clear that the WIPO General Assembly Chairman,\nAmbassador Duque of Colombia, has a report. The United States,\nour Mission, as well as that of Switzerland have asked that it\nbe released, and we are still waiting.\nIt gets into the area of the theater of the absurd because\nit only brings, I think, dishonor on those who cover these\nthings up, as well as it hurts real victims, whistleblowers who\nare trying to do the right thing for the right reasons.\nSo, how do we get the U.N. to change that kind of modus\noperandi? Why hasn't Ambassador Duque released that report? I\nmean, does it implicate people, do you think? That would be\nspeculation.\nBut it is a systemic problem, and how do you compel?\nGetting back again to the idea of withholding, there were a\nnumber of bipartisan initiatives that led to a huge so-called\narrearage back in the 1990s that we allegedly owed. And one of\nthose was for UNPROFOR, which had a miserable, miserable--let\nme say it again--a miserable record, a very bad mandate. It led\nto Srebrenica and other safe haven debacles. And yet,\ncontributing countries were demanding that we get that money,\nincluding the UK, to them for the UNPROFOR deployment. And yet,\nwe withheld it, I think out of very valid reasons.\nYes, Mr. Schaefer?\nMr. Schaefer. Let me just say that reporting to the General\nAssembly is not going to be a panacea on this at all. If you\ntake a look back at a very concrete example, after Oil for\nFood, the U.S. was able to use that scandal to establish\nsomething called the Procurement Task Force, which was an\nindependent unit to go after procurement fraud in the United\nNations.\nThey were very successful. Their efforts resulted in the\nconviction of several prominent U.N. senior officials. But\nbecause those officials were of certain nationalities, in the\ncase of the Procurement Task, Russian and Singaporean, those\ntwo countries led an effort in the General Assembly to prevent\nthe reauthorization of the Procurement Task Force. They\neliminated it because there was resentment by the governments\nwhose nationals were found to be criminally complicit in\ncorrupt schemes at the United Nations.\nSo, just reporting to the General Assembly doesn't remove\nthe politics from this, which is one of the reasons why I think\nthe State Department needs to have its own dedicated unit for\ninternational organizations in its Inspector General office. At\nleast then we can know that you will have some sort of external\neffort to inspect, and the cooperation with that unit needs to\nbe made----\nMr. Smith. How do they overcome, if you don't mind me\ninterrupting, the U.N.'s assertion that we have no right to any\nof those documents, which they will assert?\nMr. Schaefer. They do that with the GAO now.\nMr. Smith. I know they do it with the GAO, right.\nMr. Schaefer. Again, this goes back to financial levers.\nHow do you force the U.N. to comply with a lot of this? And\nthat is, if you don't do it, then we will actually withhold\nmoney.\nThis is one of the reasons why the U.S. Government won't\nfollow through on the whistleblower protections, is because\nthey know that the organizations want the money. They don't\nwant to create discomfort or distrust or ruffle feathers in the\norganization. So, they give the waivers.\nBut, if you make financial contributions complicit on\ncooperation in this area, then I think that you will see\ncooperation. They very much want the resources. The U.S. is the\nlargest contributor. It is the biggest lever that we have. And\nif we want to see external oversight of the U.N.'s operations,\nthen that is the way to go. Otherwise, you will very much see\nresistance.\nThank you.\nMs. Elbasri. I just want to echo what Mr. Schaefer just\nsaid. It is very important to stick to the law and also show\nthat, if the U.N. doesn't conduct itself as it should, there\nshould be a penalty. This has worked everywhere. I don't see\nwhy it wouldn't work for the U.N. We haven't tried it. So,\nlet's first try it and see. And I am pretty convinced that they\nwill take the law, but also whatever recommendation and\nobligations they are under, they will take it much more\nseriously.\nIn general, I think the problem with the U.N. right now, it\nis acting like the emperor. They feel, I mean senior managers\nat the U.N. Have you seen any senior U.N. official, whether the\nSecretary-General or other ever resign or pushed to resign? No.\nWhy? Because we treat them like the Catholic Church before\neveryone knew what was going on. I think this is a problem.\nI mean, this is one of my colleagues and a U.N.\nwhistleblower who made this amazing comparison. You know, if\nyou compare the U.N. to the Catholic Church, I think we are\nexactly in the same situation. We are just starting to see, we\nare just starting to talk about what is wrong. For quite a long\ntime, we held it as something sacred, as something taboo that\nno one wanted to talk about, because we all love the U.N. As a\nwhistleblower, I did what I did because I believe in a better\nU.N., because I believe in a better world. A better world will\nnot start until we fix the U.N.\nI know that to fix it we have to be truthful. We have to\nsay the painful truth that very few people are ready today to\nhear. I believe that penalty, discipline, taking a firm stand\nis the way to go.\nThank you.\nMr. Smith. Again, getting back to the WIPO, one of the\nspeculative conclusions that we drew as to why this report has\nnot been, it is to protect the Director General of the WIPO.\nWell, if that is not the case, just release it.\nBut let me just get my final question, and you have been\nvery gracious with your time, and I am very grateful for that.\nWhat happens to the victims? You, Mr. Gallo, mentioned that a\nnumber of the sexual exploitation and abuse cases are kept low,\nbut they filter through the local conduct and discipline teams,\nwhich obviously if that is happening, that hurts the victims.\nWhen I was in the DR Congo, I kept saying, ``What happened\nto those little girls? Where are they? Are they getting any\nkind of assistance, help, compassion, empathy? Or are they just\nleft to fend for themselves somewhere?'' Do you know? Does\nanybody know what is happening?\nMr. Gallo. I believe the ultimate condemnation on that, Mr.\nChairman, is if you look at the number of officials of the\nU.N., particularly the Office of Legal Affairs, that knew that\nthere were children being sexually abused in the Central\nAfrican Republic and did nothing--not only did they do nothing,\nbut they obstructed the French in the attempt to investigate\nit. That, to me, is just shocking and intolerable.\nFrom the point of view of this question, if a complainant\ncan actually get the complaint as far as the OIOS, I think that\nis probably half the battle. What you are seeing now with the\nincrease in attention focused on the Central African Republic,\nI do not believe that that is a function of decrease of\ndiscipline. I believe this situation is just coming to public\nattention because the press are interested in it, and the press\nare getting it, raising the attention, such that OIOS cannot\nignore it.\nBut the numbers are still tiny when you look at the total\nnumber. I think there were 27 complaints from the entire world\nlast year. And the only reason that there were 108 found in one\nprovince of the Central African Republic alone is because\nsomebody went out and looked.\nThere has been no willingness, there has been no proactive\nenforcement. Nobody actually goes out. Neither the conduct and\ndiscipline teams or anyone else, OIOS does not have the staff\nto actually go out trying to police these issues.\nAnd that is why I said, if the staff don't trust the\ninvestigation service, the whole thing is falling apart at that\npoint. One of the questions that I don't like to be asked is\nwhen staff members ask me, ``Should I report this?'' What am I\nsupposed to say? Then they ask me, ``Will I be retaliated\nagainst for this?''\nThe likelihood of you being retaliated against is in direct\nproportion to the importance of what you are reporting. Someone\nwho is going to report the fuel pump attendant who takes a\ngallon of kerosene home to sell for beer money or to fuel his\nstove at home, he is going to get prosecuted. They are going to\nthrow him to the wolves, but nobody is interested in looking at\nsenior officials who are probably bleeding the system dry for\nmillions and millions of dollars.\nAnd what concerns me, and has always concerned me, is not\nso much what OIOS is investigating, but what they are not\ninvestigating. This comes back to this question of the intake\nfunction. All right? The number of financial cases that are\nrejected on the grounds that that is not misconduct, it is a\nmanagement issue. ST/SGB/273, which is the mandate which covers\nthe mandate for the Investigation Division, includes an\ninvestigation of mismanagement and abuse of resources. Nobody\ncan remember the last time there was an investigation into\nmismanagement of the abuse of resources.\nIf you can at least get that far, if people will copy\nreports to their permanent missions, or whatever, I believe you\nare going to see a difference. I believe that is why the\ncentralized reporting system is different, because I think you\nare going to see very significant differences in the statistics\nof what is reported if everything is monitored and everything\nis controlled because there is an online tracking system for\nit.\nMr. Hannum. Yes, I can just echo Mr. Gallo's comments on\nthe just outrageous delays and inaction by the U.N. I can't\nspeak to everything he said.\nTo your specific question, though, can you find out the\nvictims, is there support, yes. In the Secretary-General's\nreport, in terms of the last report which doesn't include the\nmost recent allegations, but it had the number of victims, the\nnumber who are receiving assistance. I think it was at 13. I\nwould be happy to provide it to you.\nSo, there are currently victim services provided. That is\nmoney from the mission that goes to local providers who, then,\nprovide the care.\nOne of the things the Secretary-General called for was a\nVictim Trust Fund, which could basically bolster that, provide\nmore resources. That is currently set up. And actually, for\nthose peacekeepers that are kicked out and their payments are\nwithheld, that money is, then, used for the Trust Fund.\nThere are a number of just important questions on kind of\nthe breadth of services that will be required. The General\nAssembly will be having that debate in the next couple of\nweeks. I know this is something that Jane Holl Lute is looking\nvery closely at.\nAnd it is something where, in order for that Trust Fund to\nbe robust, it is something where member states would need to\nlook at kind of strengthening it. But there are certainly some\nservices provided. There needs to be more. But I would be happy\nto provide it to you.\nMr. Schaefer. Just a few concluding points. One is that\nthere is a provision in most U.N. peacekeeping operations. They\nsign the SOFA, which provides for a Standing Claims Commission\nto be set up. These aren't set up. And so, there is really no\nrecourse for a lot of people to go and actually lodge\ncomplaints for damages that are done to them by the\npeacekeeping presence or by the peacekeeping forces themselves.\nThis should be mandatory. It should be an automatic step.\nAs soon as a mission is set up, those Standing Claims\nCommissions should be set up as well. The U.N. has provisions\ninside of it that sort of allow monetary damages and they cap\nthem at a certain level. But in terms of instances of\ncriminality where someone is raped and they are seeking\ncompensation for the criminal act, I think it is important to\ntie the compensation to the perpetrator.\nIf you go to a U.N. Trust Fund, what message are you\nsending to the units themselves? You are saying that the member\nstates, or whoever decides to contribute to the Trust Fund, are\ngoing to be paying the damages that you potentially commit. The\ntroop-contributing country or the troops themselves, the person\nthat committed the crime needs to be held responsible for the\ncompensation for their actions. And that I think is an\nimportant thing. It would increase incentives for discipline,\nself-discipline, but also discipline by the troop-contributing\ncountry to make sure that their own troops don't misbehave in\nthe way that we have been seeing.\nThank you.\nMr. Hannum. Just to follow up, I wasn't saying that the\nVictim Trust Fund should be the end-all. Absolutely, they\nshould be punished. I am saying, at the very least, they should\nprovide some services because in some places the justice is\nquite slow.\nMr. Smith. Yes. Thank you.\nMs. Elbasri. Just about the question what happened to the\nvictims, I think this question should be asked of the French.\nUnfortunately, it has been now almost 2 years since they\nlearned about the allegations. We were told that they started\nan investigation immediately, which was in July 2014. And so\nfar, no French peacekeeper has been held to account. So, what\nkind of an example is France giving the organization when it\ncomes to such serious crimes? So, it goes back to the\nleadership of France today that needs to be questioned.\nThank you.\nMr. Smith. Again, thank you so much for yours very, very\nwise counsel and insights, and insightful commentary. Your\nthoughts on what a bill, if we can craft such a thing, would\nlook like would be very much welcomed. And thank you again for\nyour extraordinary service.

My staff has worked closely with the company to ensure that lands necessary for the mine to operate are not included in conservation areas. In fact, we carved out the site of the original mine as well as additional land to allow the mine to expand in the future.\nWhat the bill does is protect lands that Castle Mountain Mine, Inc., itself said are not necessary for mining operations.\nI have gone out of my way over the years to avoid conflicts with mining operations. That is reflected in my legislation. And as the Obama administration considers monument designations, I have asked them to do the same.\nSimply put: existing mining operations — including the preliminary work to reopen the mine at Castle Mountain — would not be adversely affected by monument designations.\nSen. Dianne Feinstein\nD-California\nNeither angels nor statesmen\nAbortion has been safely performed in the U.S. for more than 40 years. Former Senate majority leader Harry Reid filibustered SB1193, the human-trafficking bill, which once had wide bipartisan support. Principle sponsors Sen. Cornyn (R-Texas) and Sen. Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) added some Hyde amendment language to the bill, barring appropriations from funding services for victims of human trafficking with the fines that government would collect for their prosecutions.\nIt seems to me that government may have better prosecuted human traffickers under Rico or asset forfeiture law. Many of these trafficking victims that are smuggled in country are held as slaves and are turned to prostitution to pay their debts. It’s a multi-million dollar business.\nThis partisan bickering appeared intentionally motivated, as over the years Democrats and Republicans have shared bipartisan support for prohibitions on the public funding of abortion, pledging to keep them \"safe and rare.” Fact is public opinion draws the line at taxpayer funding. The Party of Reid was cynically filibustering a bill, of which they were historically on the wrong side.\nMeanwhile the Virginia Board of Health, the state of Texas, and others had recently approved new ambulatory directives that order clinical facilities to meet new building and hygiene specifications, bringing them in line with standards for new hospitals.\nThe Reid Senate were neither angels nor statesmen in this case, but rather ignorant and selfishly in need of a wedge issue. Perhaps the Democrat Party had conveniently forgotten the Gosnell case. Just where did these senators suppose the victims of human trafficking would go? By their intellectual shallowness; they’d go straight to Planned Parenthood and the poor neighborhoods where these “self-regulated” Gosnell-like clinics were left standing by the Wendy Davis’s and pro-choice groups who opposed ambulatory regulation, that’s were — and breaking the original promise to keep abortions safe and rare.\nBryan A. Cook\nPhelan\nPhones in the classroom\nThe Oct. 4 article regarding cyberbullying of a teacher because she took a cell phone from student prompted me to write about that incident. As a teacher, now retired, I can tell you the biggest pain and bone of contention in the high school classroom today is the students' use of their cell phones. Even if the school policy states that cell phones are not to be used during classes, they are anyway.\nTeachers also have their class rules, which invariably prohibit cell phone use in their rooms. But students think they are slick — they text on their phones right under their desk, and think the teacher does not notice.\nI don't know about you, but nobody I've seen smiles down at their crotch — unless there is a cell phone there! The penalty for getting caught/using the cell phones is confiscation. Most of the time, the kid says they are texting mom or dad, but when asked for verification (letting the teacher see the text to prove it), the phone is snapped shut. It does not matter who they are talking to, they need to stop that activity and pay attention! So, at the end of the day, the teacher brings the perp's phone to the assistant principal's office, where parents/guardians are notified that they need to come to the school to retrieve the phone.\nThe parent should be irate at their progeny, not direct their anger at the AP or the teacher, but nooooo. ...\nCell phones are prohibited because when the student is involved with texting, etc. they are not paying attention to the class, which not only annoys the teacher, but distracts the other kids. The phones are used to set up clandestine meetings in the restroom, among other things, like cheating or trying to get drugs. Therefore, school and teacher policy tries very hard to stop their use. For a parent to cyberbully a teacher for doing her job — it was no surprise to the student, I am sure — is beyond disrespectful.\nThe parent should make it clear to their student they cannot bring the phone to school at all, but they do not. Therein lies the real problem.\nGail Crestin-Bickers\nApple Valley\nTapestry Project\nThere seems to have been a lot of hand-wringing lately on the Opinion page from those opposed to the master-planned community that is probably going to be rubber-stamped by the Hesperia City Council when it comes to a vote. Namely, the famous (possibly already infamous?) Tapestry Project in southeast Hesperia.\nNow, at the outset, maybe I don't have have a dog in the fight as I live northeast in Apple Valley, but here's my tuppence ha'penny worth on the matter. Fresh off the boat as an immigrant (legally, I might add), to these shores in 1986, I enjoyed late afternoon trips with my wife zooming up to Silverwood Lake to cool down in the water and enjoy the respite and solitude of its beachy coves. On the way, we passed the Las Flores Ranch, storied even back then, a pastoral setting indeed, with horses and cattle grazing in the fields; nirvana no doubt, to some. But times change.\nWhich brings me to the hypothetical: Considering that it's an almost foregone conclusion that Tapestry will be voted in by the Hesperia council, and then no doubt subject to lawsuits from the usual protagonists of the Sierra Club, the Center for Biological Diversity and others, et al, my question is this: If this area was/is such a pristine natural environment never to be disturbed, where were these entities when the Las Flores Ranch was up for sale way back when? Or are the litigants to come just modern day extortionists over what people are allowed to do with their private property rights?\nAndrew Howard\nApple Valley\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        -\nhttps://clinton.presidentiallibraries.us/files/original/bea8c690ea05b32c084bea2fee4cf8ed.pdf\n05246dbe53c493ca2cdd10c1ca248837\nPDF Text\nText\nFOIA Number:\n2006-0465-F\nFOIA\nMARKER\nThis is not a textual record.

FRIEDMAN\nSpecial to TheNew\nWASHINGTON, May 23 - The\nWhite House is a strange place. Politicians who move in often seem to lose\ntrack of how the public feels. But that\nwas not supposed to happen to Bill\nClinton and his band of MTV-bred\nadvisers with their quicksilver reflex! es.\nDuring the Presidential campaign,\nMr. Clinton was hailed by friend and\nfoe as a rare, natural politician who\nwould never lose the populist touch.\nBut now the biggest question consuming Washington, and particularly\nDemocrats, is this: How could such a\npolitical thoroughbred seem to keep\nstumbling out of the starting gate in a\nrace for which he seemed to have\nbeen bred?\nFrom the first week of the new\nAdministration, Clinton supporters .\nhave been wailing for this young\nWhite House to turn a corner and\nBoost for G.O.P.\nThe President's recent problems\nhave improved the morale of the\nRepublican Party, which emerged\nfrom last fall's campaign perplexed\nabout its future. Page A12.\nYork Tim«\nA\\\nbuild some consistent momentum toward its mam objective of healing the\neconomy.\nAfter the flap over homosexuals in\nthe military dominated the first two\nweeks, officials said they would turn\nthe corner. After the flap over the\nabortive naming of Zoe Baird as Attorney General, officials said they\nwould turn the corner. After the failure of Mr. Clinton's stimulus package, officials said there would be a\nlittle shake-up of the White House\nstaff, but now they would really turn\nthe corner.\nBut after last week's White House\nnews was dominated by the President's pricey haircut, a revolt among\nDemocrats on taxes, more groping\nfor a workable policy on Bosnia and\nthe messy dismissal of the White\nHouse travel office amid charges of\ncronyism, many Democratic supporters of Mr. Clinton are beginning to\nwhisper the. previously unwhisperable: What if this White House never\nturns the corner? What if the real\nproblem is not focus, or staff, or orgaConfmued on Page A13, Column I\nContinued From Page Al\nnizational charts, but somehow the\nPresident himself?\nNo Democratic lawmakers want to\nsay it aloud for fear of adding to Mr.\nClinton's travails. But several have\nexpressed the view that last week's\nperformance by the White House was\nscary, because of the way it crystallized everything that seems to be\nwrong: a loss of political judgment, a\nlack of strategic vision and a White\nHouse that now seems much closer to\nHollywood than a town called Hope.\n<\n•\n<\n•\nz\ntt\no\n53.\n§\ntt\nz\n5\no\nZ\ng\n5\na*.\nStill Democratic lawmakers believe that there is no question Mr.\nClinton will have his momentum back\nif he can get his economic package\nthrough Congress reasonably intact\nin the coming few weeks and many\nmissteps of the early months could be\nforgotten. Mr. Clinton had a record of\nlearning from his mistakes as Governor of Arkansas, and even his gleeful\nRepublican opponents do not yet dare\nwrite him off.\nAlmost Typecasting\nBut what many Clinton supporters\n— members of Congress, staff members and party workers who truly\nwant to see him succeed — say is\ntroubling them is that they see a\nPresident who is coming perilously\nclose this early in his term to being\ntypecast in a way that will only reinforce his troubles.\nPresident Gerald R. Ford may\nhave been the best athlete ever to\noccupy the Oval Office, but after repeatedly tripping, he was labeled as a\nstumbler. After that, every misstep\nhe made, which would have been ignored with any other President, became news and reinforced the stereotype.\nOnce President Jimmy Carter was\nlabeled as someone who was weak in\nhis handling of the Soviet Union and\nIran and could easily be swayed, an\nattack by a bunny rabbit on his canoe\nbecame big news and reinforced the\nstereotype.\nThe same thing seems to be starting to happen to Mr. Clinton. On Saturday he went to New Hampshire to\nget back to his message of selling his\nbudget Some of that message did\nmake the papers. But the news programs were also peppered by repons\nthat the press plane hired by the new\nThe White House\nseems unable to\ndominate a game\nin its strong suit.\nWhite House travel office broke down\nand almost failed to arrive in time for\nthe President's speech. Beyond that,\npractically every sign alluding to Mr.\nClinton's $200 coif by a Beverly Hills\nstylist, Cristophe, including one that\nsaid \"Nice haircut, Bubba,\" made the\npapers.\nThe fate of the White House press i\nplane and travel office would normally never be news; the President's\nlatest haircut would normally never\nbe news. But they become news, and\ncrowd out other stories, when the\nperception has been created that they\nare somehow revealing of the real\ncharacter of the President or the\nWhite House.\nComing on top of the failure of Mr.\nClinton's economic stimulus package\nand the revolt in his own party, they\nare. For what these incidents highlight are the two things that have\nbeen sorely missing from this White\nHouse from the very start — good\nsound political judgment and a strategic vision.\nWhen the President suggested that\nhis hair stylist give him a trim\naboard Air Force One while the plane\nsat at Los Angeles Intemational Airport, no adviser or the President himself seemed to recognize that if this\nstory got out the same week he was\ntrying to sell austerity and belt tightening to the American people, it could\nbe very hurtful for him? When White,\nHouse officials are asked these questions they answer sheepishly, \"No.\"\nBlaming the Press\nIt seemed little short of bizarre\nthat Bill Clinton and his Hollywood\nfriend Harry Thomason, who together understood and developed the powerful symbolism of the \"candidate\nfrom Hope,\" were suddenly going\nblind and tone deaf to the symbolism\nof this very same President tying up\ntraffic at the Los Angeles airport for\n56 minutes while he had his locks\nshorn by Mr. Thomason's Beverly\nHills coiffeur.\nWhen the White House communications director, George Stephanopou-\n�4i\nWhite House Memo\n\\fter Deft Fall Campaign, President Is Stumbling in Office\nlos, was asked lo explain this, ne\nblamed lhe press, saying, \"There\nseems to be some sort of obsession\nwilh side issues.\" That reinforced the\nsense of a White House that had lost\nits polilical feel.\nBui this was not an isolated incident of political ineptitude, l l came\nafter three months of flip-flopping on\nhow forceful to be on Bosnia, without\never explaining any of the shifts to\nthe American people, including Saturday's agreement wilh the allies. .\nThe latest political miscue also followed Mr. Clinton's unusually mal-\nadroii performance at the White\nHouse correspondents' dinner, when\nhe used an occasion normally reserved for a little self-deprecating\nhumor to attack the conservaiive\ncommentator Rush Limbaugh and\nlhe Senate Republican leader Bob\nDole in ways that made him look\nmean spirited.\nSurprise at Revolt\nIt also came after the Presidenl,\nwho is considered a supreme politician, was confronted by a revoli by\nconservaiive Democrats over his\nbudgei package, a revoli which\nseems to have taken him at least\npartly by surprise and has left him on\nthe defensive, trying to drum up\nsupport from (he public by running\nagainst a faction of his own party\nJudgment also seemed to have\nbeen sorely lacking in lhe iravel office fiasco it may indeed turn oul, as\nIhe White House has suggested, lhal\nlhe travel office was not being managed in a professional, or even honesi,\nmanner and the staff deserved to be\ndismissed.

So today, as\nmore patients enroll in health-maintenance organizations or physician networks that rely heavily on general doctors to hold down costs, a rising demand is confronting a declining supply.\nHalf in Primary Care\nHealth economists say that a medical system should have about 50 percent of its doctors practicing p r i m a r y\ncare, which includes family practice,\ninternal medicine and pediatrics, and\nthat is the m i x now favored by most\nlarge H.M.O.'s. But the current percentage of primary-care doctors in the\ncountry is only about 33 percent, and,\nworse, it is falling.\nIn 1992, only 14.6 percent of medical\nstudents decided to go into general\nmedicine, an all-time low. At that rate,\nthe proportion of primary-care doctors\n: will drop to 28 percent or less by 2010.\n\"We should t r y to achieve a 50-50\nbalance as soon as possible, but we\nhave a long way l o go,\" said Dr/ Robert\nHarmon, administrator of t h e United\nStates Health Resources and Services\nAdministration. \" E v e n if medical\nschools started graduating 50 percent.\nprimary-care specialists today, it could\nstill take us to beyond the year 2000 to\nachieve a good m i x . \"\nFilling the Gap\nAlready, \"patients are not getting\nthe right kind of attention from the\nright kind of doctors, and specialists\nare not getting enough patients in their\nspecialty to keep their skills u p , \" said\nProf. E l i Ginzberg, a health economist\nat Columbia Universily.\nHeallh economists say it will take a\nmixture oi market forces and policy\nchanges to fill the gap.

Mr. Sleeper said that in 1992 he\nconducted 11 national polls, 56 state\npolls and 54 focus groups, along with\n7,000 continuous polling interviews in\nOctober alone.

To\nprovide a cover for this divvying of\nthe election spoils, an accounting\nfirm was hired to nail the old-timers\nfor past sloppiness.\nThat's politics; there's no job security in the White House. But when the\npress turned up Crony Thomason's\npitch and Cousin Cathy's replacement\nplan, both written before the accountant was assigned to dig up dirt — the\nClinton White House panicked.\nThat's when the spoils were spoiled.\nTo justify the firing of the staff, to\nmake way for Distant-Cousin Cathy\nand her friends, somebody in the\nWhite House made an improper call to\nsomebody at the Justice Department.\nWe should find out who: maybe the\nde facto Attorney General, Webster\nHubbell, Hillary's law partner; perhaps F.B.I. Director William Sessions,\nwho seems ready to do anything for\nthe White House to save his job.\nWithin hours of the White House\ndemand, an extraordinary F.B.I.\nstatement was issued — on Justice\nDepartment stationery — that there\nwas \"sufficient information for the\nF.B.I. to determine that additional\ncriminal investigation is warranted.\"\nDon't just kick 'em out — kill 'em.\nThat was an abuse of power. White\nHouse pressure to prosecute is now\nheavy, but the presumption of innocence has not been repealed.\n'\nIf the accountant's report suggested any crime, it should have been\npromptly given to the F.B.I.; employees should have been given their\nrights, informed of the charges and\ngiven a chance to respond.\nInstead, seven people with families\nwere not only canned, but their reputations were blackened and chances\nto get another job removed by a politically motivated F.B.I. press release.\nWhy? To provide a law-enforcement\npublicity cover for an embarrassing\ndisplay of raw patronage.\nBill Clinton may get away with this\nriding-roughshod over civil liberty;\nhe may even get away with the vastly\ngreater error of abandoning the suffering Bosnians; but there is some\npoetic justice in the way he will pay\nfor trying to swagger through his\nPresidency with $200 haircuts from\nCristophe cf Beverly Hills.\n•\nMONDAV, MAY 24, 1993\nA/\n�Abroad at Home\nANTHONY LEWIS\nThe\nEnd of\nAn Era\nBOSTON\n\"It's the end of an era,\" a veteran\ndiplomat said — \"the era of American leadership and power in Europe.\" He was commenting on President Clinton's acceptance of the European plan to set up \"safe havens\"\nfor Muslims in Bosnia.\nJust two weeks ago, on his Euro-,\npean tour, Secretary of State Warren\nChristopher rejected the safe haven\nidea. It would confine 1.2 million Muslims to the equivalent of ghettos, he\nsaid, and effectively ratify Serbian\nconquests elsewhere in Bosnia.\nNow Mr. Christopher said the United States was agreeing to the idea\nbecause Russia, Britain, France and\nSpain wanted it. President Clinton\nsaid, \"At least we're together again.\"\nThe end of an era.\nWill the plan do any good? It does\nat least purport to protect six\nenclaves from Serbian shelling and\nsniper fire. But how effective that\nA dubious\nagreement\non Bosnia.\nwill be depends on some big ifs.\nFirst, the United Nations force now\nin Bosnia operates under restrictive\nrules of engagement. Soldiers cannot\nfire to protect Bosnians. The hope is\nthat their mere presence in an area\nwould persuade the Serbs to respect\nits safety. Can anyone be confident of\nthat after all the promises the Serbs\nhave broken?\nA crucial question, therefore, is\nwhat the rules of engagement will be\nfor the enlarged U.N. force envisaged\nby the new plan. To be meaningful,\nthe rules would have to allow the\nforce to respond to attacks on designated safe areas.\nSecond, President Clinton promised to provide U.S. air power — but\nonly to protect U.N. forces \"in the\nevent they are attacked.\" But a direct\nattack on U.N. troops is unlikely. The\nneed is for air response to shelling of\nthe safe areas.\nHere again the rules of engagement are important. If they allow\nthe U.N. force to respond to Serbian\nshelling of safe havens, then American planes defending the force would\nbe useful in silencing the Serbian\nguns.\nThird, one of the most appalling\nproblems for the U.N. force until now\nhas been the difficulty in getting relief supplies through to Muslim enclaves. Serbian commanders routinely block convoys, seize goods and\nmoney and generally make ground\nroutes so unreliable that food air\ndrops started by President Clinton\nhave been necessary.\nEven Henry Kissinger, who has opposed American military involvement, said last week that force should\nbe used if necessary to stop the Serbian holdups and get relief supplies\nthrough. But the allies' communique\non the new plan tamely says they\n\"will insist that all parties allow humanitarian aid to pass without hindrance.\"\nFourth, another critical element is\nsealing the border with Serbia, which\nhas supplied the Bosnian Serb militia.\nPresident Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia promised to stop the traffic — but\nthat was when he feared U.S. intervention. The supplies are still flowing.\nOn this issue, too, the allied communique was weak. It said it relied on\nSerbia to keep the border closed, adding merely that \"we can assist, for\ninstance by placing monitors on the\nborder.\" But Mr. Milosevic, who had\noffered to allow international monitors, withdrew the offer.\nSerbians greeted the allied plan as\nvictory, not concealing their contempt. Serbian forces went on shelling Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. The\nBosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, said he would respect the safe\nhavens — if the allies accepted the\nSerbs' \"sovereignty\" in areas of Bosnia they have seized.\nIn short, the allied plan looks like a\nfig leaf to conceal the effective acceptance of Serbian conquests. It\nlooks like a new way for politicians to\nsay they are doing something about a\ntragedy they have done little or nothing to stop.\nEffective measures are very difficult after all the past dithering\nby European and American governments. But the precedent of inaction\nin the face-of \"ethnic cleansing\" will\nhang over us. Other demagogues are\nready to arouse religious and racial\npassions in many parts of the former\nSoviet Union and eastern Europe.\nAnd America's role in Europe will\nnot be the same. Why would Europeans look across the Atlantic for\nleadership to a government that does\nnot know what it wants? What credibility can NATO have after a failure\nto stop crimes against humanity in its\nown backyard? Will Amencans continue to support a massive commitment of U.S. troops to Europe?

The Pentagon will now\nconcentrate on developing ground-based antiballistic missiles to protect American forces in the field\nand citizens in the continental U.S. against limited\nmissile attacks.\nThe change is more symbolic than substantive.\nCongress had already begun the reorientation. And\nthe Clinton Administration is keeping 1994 spending\nat this year's lavish $3.8 billion. That's sure to rise\naa the program moves from research to prototypes.\nThe Pentagon wants to spend $1.8 billion'next\nyear on defenses to counter missile attacks on the\nbattlefield. The televised performance of Patriot\nmissiles during the Persian Gulf war boosted Congressional interest in such defenses, but the Patriot's success was grossly exaggerated. Now the\nPertagon is developing no fewer than four new,\nunproven anti-missile systems for battlefield use\nEven more doubtful is the $1.2 billion to be\nspent developing continental defenses against an\nunauthorized launch by a maverick Russian general or a limited attack by a nuclear renegade state\nContinued research on such continental defenses\nmakes sense, but there is no need to rush their\ndevelopment or deployment.\nIntelligence officials have testified that thev\n\"do not believe there is a concern about unauthorized launch by Russia or the other ex-Soviet nuclear republics. And they foresee no renegade state\ncapable of building nuclear warheads and the missiles needed to deliver them \"for at least another\ndecade.

Mario Cuomo often complains that he\ndoesn't know what New Yorkers get in return for all\nthe money they spend on public schools. Now he's\nappointed a special investigative commission to\nfollow the dollars.\nThe state probably ought to take a closer look\nat how public schools operate. But this commission\nmust be careful not merely to duplicate the work of\nother commissions that have yet to see the fruits of\ntheir labors implemented.\nTotal funding for the state's elementary and\nsecondary schools is about $22 billion a year. About\n40 percent is provided by Albany; the rest comes\nmainly from local property taxes. But for all the\nmoney being spent, are schools organizing their\ntime and resources in ways that maximize educational quality?\nThat's a particularly relevant question in light\nof the huge $960,000 retirement package awarded\nlast year to the superintendent of a special school\ndistrict on Long Island. The award triggered a legal\nchallenge and public discontent; it's one reason why\nMr. Cuomo created his new nine-member commission on educational structure, policies and practices. The commission will have subpoena power to\ninvestigate how local districts spend their money\nand manage other resources like time, technology\nand buildings.\nState Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol\nquestioned whether the new panel would simply\nduplicate the work of previous commissions that\nhave looked at issues ranging from school finance to\nproper preparation of students for college and the\nwork force. But it is not clear how well the Board of\nRegents and the State Education Department have\nbeen doing their job of oversight and monitoring.\nThe commission's end-of-the-year report will represent Mr. Cuomo s own brand of school reform:\n^ ^ ™ I ° ™ J ^ M E S NATIONA! ^\n-\n�Better Than Nothing on Bosnia\nV\nAffpr roio^ti„„ n_»„.j —\n.\n. .\nAfter rejecting President. Clinton's plan to help\nthe Bosnian Government defend itself, Britain\nFrance, Russia and Spain have won American\nagreement to a less ambitious proposal. The new\nplan, if it can be implemented, is less than adequate\nbut better than nothing.\nThe plan would station some 15,000 European\nand Canadian ground troops under a U.N. flag to\ndeter Bosnian Serb attacks against six U.N.-designated safe havens. That would concentrate outside\njorces where they are most needed — m the beleagfleted cities of Sarajevo, Bihac, Gorazde Srebrenica.Tuzla and Zepa. These cities are now home to 1 2\nhnHton Bosnian Muslims, roughly two-thirds of the\nSQSyivmg Muslim population.\nThe bulk of the 15,000 would be drawn from the\n5^500 U.N. troops already stationed in Bosnia for\nhumanitarian relief. U.S. air power would be available to defend these international forces, but not to\ndefend the Bosnians themselves.\nEssentially, the U.S. and the Europeans have\nagreed on the lowest common denominator of their\ndifferently conceived approaches. The U.S. has given up, at least for now, its idea of arming the\nBosnian Government because of European objections Meanwhile, Britain and France have pulled\nback from the Vance-Owen peace plan, because Mr\nClinton rightly refused to supply the massive\nground troops that would be needed if the Bosnian\ncombatants failed to honor the plan.\nBut there's some doubt whether the safe ha\nvens plan can even be put into effect. U.N. Security\nCounal endorsement is probable. But Bosnia's Government has already denounced the proposal as\nnrn^p\"\nP\n^ ^ t i o n and failing to\nprotect Bosnian civilians.

But Europe decisively rebuffed that\nproposal, and the President wisely chose not to\nproceed without their support.\nThe allies' new position recognizes the reality\nthat none of them are prepared to contest the Serbs\non the battlefield. For the 1.2 million Bosnians under\nn f„\nH K\n8ee-swollen cit es\"the\nplan provides hope of limited relief. Sadly, that may\nbe all that can be salvaged at this point\nd y\natt\naCk\nin\nt h e\nS i X\nrefu\nRehabilitating Empire Blue Cross\nThe board of Empire Blue Cross and Blue\nShield, asleep as the company's financial fortunes\nplummeted, has finally taken a corrective step by\nfiring Albert Cardone, its chief executive. Mr. Cardone's imperious demeanor and lavish corporate\nlife style annoyed Albany legislators and enraged\ncustomers hit with double-digit premium hikes.\nFollowing a spate of embarrassing revelations, the\nboard admitted that Mr. Cardone had to go to allow\nEmpire to repair its reputation.\nDismissing Mr. Cardone won't by itself solve\nEmpire's glaring problems: huge losses, poor customer service, and actual and threatened lawsuits\nwith large corporate clients. Empire needs an overhaul, not a mere shuffling of the names atop the\ncorporate tote board.\n...\nEmpire, the largest nonprofit health insurer in\n^.tlie nation, covers more than eight million New\nVb'rkers. The state requires Empire to insure any\n.JUPplicant and charge a community rate unrelated\nto the applicant's medical condition. (Commercial\ninsurers, by contrast, offer discounts to lure healthy\ncustomers — a practice known as cherry picking.)\nIn return, the Legislature grants Empire tax-free\nstatus and substantial discounts on rates it pays for\nhospital services. Nevertheless, Empire racked up\n• losses of about $250 million the last two years.\nEmpire says the cherry picking has left it with\nunhealthy, expensive-to-cover enrollees. It also\n' Wames the recession that's hit the insurance industry. An independent audit ordered by the State\nLegislature agreed that economic forces were\n<:\nTHE N E W\nthe primary reasons for Empire's poor showing.\nBut they weren't the only reasons. Empire's\ncommunity-rated clients account for only about 15\npercent of its business; it has also lost huge\namounts on large corporate clients, who are not\ncharged community rates, and on its health maintenance organization. Some of its best corporate\nclients have left because of poor service.\nThe audit report charged that Empire's management is autocratic, hierarchical and \"slow to\nreact to the pace of change.. . .neither organized nor\nmanaged to become a market leader in innovation\nor quality improvement.\" And a recent series in\nThe Times exposed a pattern of managerial miscues, including dubious sweetheart contracts with\ncorporate insiders.\nSince the audit report, A.T.&T., a major client,\naccused Empire of fraudulently failing to pass\nalong discounts it received on hospital bills; indeed,\nfor the type of contract it had with A.T.&T., Empire\nmay have taken advantage of discounts for which it\nwas not eligible. And two weeks ago The Times\nreported that the Federal Government was threatening to cancel Empire's contract for processing\nMedicare claims because of poor performance.\nThe report and subsequent revelations jarred\nthe board. After extensive interviews, an investigating committee unearthed low morale and complaints about Mr. Cardone's brusque, autocratic\nstyle. Mr. Cardone didn't cause most of Empire's\nproblems. But without the trust of the public, state\nlegislators or subordinates, he was clearly not the\nleader to rehabilitate the company. The board finally got the message.\nYORK TIMES NATIONAL\nMONDAV.

But in the end, officials\nsaid, allied unity in an effort to save\nas many lives as possible was\nthought preferable to continued\ndiscord over proposals to impose\npeace on the warring factions.\nKaradzic, whom U.S. officials\nhave said bears heavy responsibility\nfor war crimes in Bosnia, praised\nthe initiative and Clinton in particular, calling him \"a sage man to reject the counsel of hawks who\nwanted to pull him into a Balkan...\nwar\" and declaring that Clinton's\nrestrained course of action would\nmake him \"a great president.\"\nKaradzic characterized the joint\naction plan as \"realistic\" considering\nthe military and political situation in\nBosnia and told Serb-controlled media that he would call for direct\ntalks among Bosnian Serbs, Muslims and Croats to divide the republic into three communally based\nconfederated states.\nUnless President Izetbegovic is\nready to accept the formation of\nthree separate states in Bosnia,\nKaradzic said, \"it is clear he will\nlead his people to the brink of total\nextinction.\"\nIzetbegovic, the only factional\nleader who strongly supports the\nperpetuation of Bosnia as a unitary,\nmulti-communal state, echoed the\ndisappointment heard around this\nancient capital today when he said\nthat the new U.S.-European plan\nmeans that the heavily armed Serbs\n\"will not withdraw from the occupied territories and that our people\nwho have been evicted from their\nhomes will not be able to return.\"\nHe termed the projected safe havens \"a kind of Indian reservation\nfor Muslims\" and bemoaned what\nhe called \"a new code of behavior by\nwhich force will be the first and last\nargument\" in international affairs.\nIzetbegovic also said it was manifestly unfair that the Bosnian Serbs\nappear to have gone unpunished for\ntheir overwhelming rejection of a\nU.N.-backed comprehensive peace\nplan that would divide Bosnia into\n10 communally based provinces\nunder a weak central government\nand require the Serbs to relinquish\nmore than a third of the land they\nnow control. Both the Muslims and\nCroats have accepted the planformulated by veteran diplomats\nDavid Owen and Cyrus Vance—\nwhich the U.S. proposals for forceful military action against the Serbs\nwere intended 40 fort* them to sign\nas well.\nBut to Muslim officials here today, the Vance-Owen plan seemed\nall but abandoned. \"I expect Lord\nOwen and the others to resign after\nthis; it's a total repudiation of his\nplan,\" said Bosnian Vice President\nEjup Ganic. The five-nation initiative does indeed hope to put further\n\"pressure on the Bosnia Serbs to\naccept the [ Vance-Owen J peace\nplan\" but it lays out no clear formula\nfor effecting this.\nIzetbegovic's emotional declaration and the disheartened statements of other Muslim officials\nhighlighted the confusion that appears to reign in the Bosnian government, which appears to have no\nfirm strategy on what to do next,\nnow that the West has essentially\nrefused to back its cause with air\nstrikes and arms. \"We can barely\nplan for tonight; how can we plan\nfor tomorrow?\" said Information\"\nMinister Ivo Knezevic.\nGovernment officials are debating whether to continue ad hoc negotiations on creation of the six safe\nhavens—first authorized by the\nU.N. Security Council late last\nmonth—Knezevic said, adding that\nsome officials want to drop the talks\naltogether. Izetbegovic said the\ntalks—now focused on establishment of a demilitarized zone around\nSarajevo—would continue for now.\n\"Really, we don't know what to do\nin this situation,\" he said. \"We were\ncounting on the West, and then\nnothing happened. We feel let\ndown. We were not prepared.\"\nAnd Muslim outrage over the\nnew inititiave was not confined to\nSarajevo. Thirty miles to the northwest in Zenica, the largest Muslimheld city outside the capital, Mayor\nBesim Spahic emotionally denounced the new action plan as \"a\nvery hypocritical, nasty game... a\nbig cheat and a big lie.\n\"Don't talk to me about Western\nor European culture,\" he added, \"or\nabout democratic freedoms, human\nrights.

But the Marshall papers underscore that the conservatives were bold,\nconfident—and ultimately victorious.\nThe turn in the court's thinking is illustrated in the files on the deliberations in\nPatterson v. McLean Credit Union, a racial\nharassment case that Kennedy wrested\naway from Brennan in the spring of 1989.\nThe case stemmed from a lawsuit by\nBrenda Patterson, a black woman who had\nworked as a teller and file clerk at the\nMcLean Credit Union in Winston Salem,\nN.C. She sued the credit union, alleging\nthat she had been harassed and denied a\npromotion because of her race.\nShe brought her case under a post-Civil\nWar era law that says \"all persons. . . have\nthe same right... to make and enforce contracts.\" The law is known as Section 1981\nbecause of its place in the statute books and\nit was intended to make sure that blacks are\nas free as whites to engage in business. It\nhad through the years become a significant\ncounterpart to Title VII of the 1964 Civil\nRights Act because, unlike that law, it allowed blacks to sue for unlimited money\ndamages for job discrimination.\nffuhmftoo Pow Suff WritCT ff \\ \\\nI\nn its 1988-89 term, the Supreme Court made a decisive break with a string of\nliberal civilrightsdecisions dating back decades.

The 1988-89 term\nmarked the end of that era, as\nthe justices limited affirmative\naction, made it harder for workers to prove discrimination and\ncut back the money remedies\nfor those who could prove discrimination.\nThe once-private papers\nshow that Justice William J.\nBrennan Jr., the tactical powerhouse of the liberal wing for a\ngeneration, was desperately\ntrying to stall the conservatives.\nWriting cajoling memos and\nsearching out compromise,\nBrennan sought to prevent further erosion of the Warren\nSee PAPERS, AlO, CoL 1\nMONDAY. MAY 24\nMain Question in Patterson\nWas On-the-Job Harassment\nA key question in the Patterson case was\nwhether that law applied to discrimination—in this case on-the-job harassment—\nthat occurs after someone is hired. The 4th\nU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had said no.\nWhen the case got to the Supreme Court,\nBrennan disagreed with the lower court. So\ndid four other justices, Marshall, Harry A.\nBlackmun, John Paul Stevens and Kennedy,\naccording to a tally sheet in Marshall's files\nprepared after the justices voted following\noral arguments in the case in October 1988.\nUnder the court's rules, the writing of\nthe majority opinion is assigned by the chief\njustice, if he is in the majority, or, if he is\nnot, by the senior justice who is. In the Patterson case, Brennan, as the senior justice\nin the majority, chose to write the opinion\nhimself.\nBrennan's first draft, dated Dec. 3,1988,\nand written as if he had at least a five-justice majority, said Patterson had a claim\nunder Section 1981. \"Where a black employee demonstrates that she has worked in\nconditions substantially different from those\nenjoyed by similarly situated white employees, and can show the necessary racial animus, a jury may infer that the black employee has not been afforded the same right\nto make an employment contract as white\nemployees,\" he wrote.\nIn January, Justice Byron R. White circulated the first draft of a partial dissent\nthat broke from Brennan on the question of\nwhether racial harassment was covered by\nthe post-Civil War law. Rehnquist and Scalia\ntold White they would join him, according to\nmemos in the Marshall papers.\nj Brennan was still counting on Kennedy.\n; On April 27, 1989, however, Kennedy\n• circulated a draft dissent of his own, objecting to Brennan's conclusion that racial har; assment was covered under the law as a\n; breach of contract. Justices Sandra Day\n; O'Connor and Scalia joined Kennedy imme; diately.\nBrennan did not give up, the files show.\n; He still thought he could keep the majority\nby putting a spin of sorts on Kennedy's ap. proach: He would depart from his first draft\n; by agreeing with Kennedy that Patterson\n; did not have a racial harassment claim, but\n; not because the law didn't apply to harass; ment. He would conclude her claim was\n: barred because she did not make the proper\n; allegations at trial—basically a procedural\nproblem.\n: Then, he proposed, he would announce\n: for the court that Section 1981 indeed can\nI cover a properly presented racial harassment allegation.\nI Kennedy would not buy it. His second\n? draft, contained in the Marshall files, stated\n^that the law simply \"does not apply to conduct which occurs subsequent to the formation of a contract,\" that is, after the hiring\ndecision is made.\nThe next day, White joined Kennedy, and\nwrote his own proposed concurring statement that the public never saw. In it, in\nmocking tones, White called Brennan on his\nnew reasoning.\n\"With all due respect, Justice Brennan's\nproposed ending to this lawsuit is as unsatisfying as the conclusion of a bad mystery\nnovel: we leam on the last page that the\nvictim has been done-in by a suspect heretofore unknown, for reasons previously unrevealed.\" White was referring to Brennan's sudden conclusion that Patterson\ncould not win the harassment part of her\ncase because of a procedural problem.\nBrennan clearly no longer had a majority.\nOn May 18, Rehnquist stepped in and reassigned the case to Kennedy for the majority opinion, which ultimately was joined\nby Rehnquist, White, O'Connor and Scalia.\nThe defeat did not sit well with Brennan.\nIn an uncharacteristic display, he drafted a\nbiting dissent attacking the court: \"The\ncourt's fine phrases about our commitment\nto\nthe\neradication\nof\nracial\ndiscrimination.. ..seem to count for little in\npractice.\"\nKennedy responded in kind, adding a\nfootnote aimed at Brennan: Brennan, he\nsaid, \"thinks it judicious to bolster his position by questioning the court's understanding dl the necessity to eradicate racial\ndiscrimination. The commitment to equality, fairness, ahd compassion is not a treasured monopoly of our colleagues in dissent.\"\nIn the end, both deleted those comments\nand the public never saw them.\nRuling in Wards Cove\nGenerates Sharp Debate\nProbably the most controversial job discrimination ruling of the 1988-89 session,\nand one that would later generate bitter\narguments in Congress, was Wards Cove\nPacking Co. v. Atmto. In that June 5,1989.\ncase the court reversed part of a landmark\n1971 ruling that prohibited employers from\ndiscriminating against minorities by requiring job applicants to have skills or academic\nrequirements that were unrelated to the\njob.\n1993\nTHE t4SHfwcTnw PTKT\n�At issue were seemingly neutral hiring\npractices—such as aptitude tests and\n; height-weight requirements—that could\nend up excluding certain classes of people.\nIn the Wards Cove conflict, Asian and\nAlaskan natives said they were kept out of\nthe better jobs at an Alaska salmon cannery.\nThey alleged that the low-level cannery\nworkers were hired from native villages in\nAlaska nnd through a longshoremen's union,\nwhile the higher paid workers got their jobs\nthrough word-of-mouth recruitment, nepotism and priority for former workers. As a\nresult, the minorities alleged, the nonwhites were shut out of the best jobs.\n| Before Wards Cove, under established\ncourt precedent, aggrieved workers could\nclaim that a collection of hiring practices\nwas discriminatory without demonstrating\nspecifically how each caused particular bias.\nIn the Wards Cove ruling, the court made\nsuch a demonstration mandatory. It said\nthat an employee could not get to court if he\nwas unable to specifically identify each hiring practice that caused his particular group\nto be excluded. The difference was crucial.\nDetermining the exact impact of a variety\nof recruiting tests and interviews a company uses is difficult.\nScalia, according to the files contained in\nthe Marshall papers, was the justice responsible for that change.\nWhite had been assigned the majority\nopinion. In his drafts, he had tried to give\nplaintiff employees some flexibility in such\nsituations. While it would be preferable for\nthem to be specific, he wrote, it might not\nalways be possible. They \"should not be expected to do the impossible,\" he wrote.\n\"Employee selection procedures may involve many factors, and if not possible to\nseparate and challenge the impact of each of\nthese factors, their collective result may\nform the basis\" for a case.\nScalia protested to White in a memo.\n\"Simply announcing in the abstract that\n'where you can't do it you don't have to'\ncreates an exception that promises to devour the rule.\"\nScalia wanted the court to hold that a\ncomplaining worker must be specific. \"Undoubtedly it will sometimes be impossible\nfor a plaintiff to prove causation even\nthough it exists,\" he acknowledged. \"But\nthere is no field of the law in which we set\nup the rules of proof in such fashion that the\ngenuinely injured person will always be able\nto prove his case.\"\nRehnquist and Kennedy told White they\nagreed with Scalia, and White dropped the\nexception. O'Connor joined them for the\nmajority. The same four justices who dissented in Patterson —Brennan, Marshall,\nBlackmun and Stevens—dissented in\nWards Cove.\nWhen the Wards Cove decision was announced, employers said they would be better able to defend themselves against frivolous claims of bias.\nThe leaders of the country'srnqorcivil\nrights organizations, believing that their\ncause had suffered a grievous blow, sought\ncongressional action.\n• <-•\n•.\nDuring debate over reversing thcnpecificity requirement and other key parts of\nthe ruling, employers said if the stangatds\nfor bringing lawsuits were too easy, they\nwould be forced to resort to quota hiring\nto protect themselves. The Bush administration adopted that argument—calling\nthe legislation a \"quota bill\"—until the final weeks of negotiations over what would\nbecome the Civil Rights Act of 1991.\nLaw Reverses\nInvolving Job Bias\nIn the end, Congress decided that if a\nworker can convince a judge that elements\nof a company's decision-making process\ncannot be separated for analysis, the entire\nprocess may be challenged as one employment practice. That new law also reversed\nthe Patterson case and seven other job-discrimination rulings, most from the 1988-89\nterm.\nWhile it was plain that the Congress, not\nthe court, would be the new avenue for civil\nrights activism, Brennan, who had joined\nthe court in 1956, was able to eke out one\nlast victory in 1990. But it was a struggle.\nThe new case arose from a congressional\norder that the FCC give preferential treatment to blacks and other minorities who apply for television and radio broadcast licenses. White-owned broadcasting companies said the policy violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the\nlaw.\nBrennan, in Metro Broadcasting «. Federal Communications Commission, began\nhis drafts with an approach that would have\nbeen unprecedented in making it easy for\ngovernments to award contracts based on\nrace.\nBut over several weeks, through five\ndrafts, he backed off as he tried to attract\nJustices White and Stevens. One year earlier, those justices had voted against a\nRichmond program that set aside a certain\npercentage of municipal contracts for minorities. Eventually, Brennan came up\nwith a narrow ruling likely to apply to only\na few federal programs. Justices White,\nStevens, Marshall and Blackmun joined\nhim.\nWhile he was wooing White and Stevens,\nBrennan strained not to compromise the\ninterests of his liberal soulmate, Marshall\nOn June 26, one day before the Brennan\nopinion would be issued, Marshall wrote to\nBrennan one sentence: \"I'm still with you.\"\nThat was among the last of the formal\nexchanges between the two friends while\nthey both sat on the court. Less than a\nmonth later, Brennan suffered a small\nstroke.

Their way of handling a dispute\nis to beat someone up,\" said Linda\nMilfred, who last year pulled her\nCRITICAL CONDITION\nTHE STATE OF AMERICA'S CITIES\nson, Nicholas, 14, out of Inman and\nenrolled him at Paideia.\nInitially, Milfred, a corporate lawyer who is white, abhorred the idea\nof- a private school. The last thing\nshe wanted was her son to be with a\nnest of children \"whose idea of the\nreal world is thinking that if someone\nmade less than $100,000, they were\non the way to the soup kitchen.\"\nBut, increasingly, she was unsettled by her local public school. At\norientation, parents were lectured\non \"Keeping Our Children in School.\"\nThat, she said, was the first sign that\nthe school was preoccupied with \"the\nlowest common denominator.\"\n\"Public schools used to be for\neverybody, so that the average student was truly average,\" she said.\n\"Today, their average student is\nquite poor.\"\nMany people share Milfred's concerns. Except for recognized islands\nof excellence in the public schools,\nthere increasingly are two tiers of\nschools in major American cities:\nfree schools for the low-income, and\nschools costing $1,000 to $10,000\na year for everybody else.\nAccording to a new survey of the\n47 largest cities, only one of four\nchildren in public schools is white.\nThousands of white parents have\nSee ATLANTA, A12, CoL 1\nMONDAY.

In nearly all\nof the 47 largest urban school systems, the percentage\nof minorities has been soaring at the same time the total enrollment has been shrinking.\n\"The significance behind the numbers is that they\nshow the increased concentration of need in the big city\n-schools,\" said Michael Casserly, executive director of\n'the Council of the Great City Schools, which represents\nthe largest urban public school systems and conducted\n; Die study. \"It is more economic flight than white flight.\"\n; ~-To a large degree, the black middle and upper classes\n«bo have abandoned urban schools. Black parents with\nSthe option increasingly choose to pay tuition in the city\nleave for the suburbs. In Atlanta, like the District,\nie majority of black students in the metropolitan area\nDW live in the suburbs, according to studies by Gary\nj^field, a Harvard University professor who has writtSi widely on school segregation.\n5\"Minorities are sorting themselves out by class,\" OrGeld said, saying this is adding to the urban school crisis.\n\"There are more and more kids with more devastating problems\" left behind in the city schools, he said.\n\"At a certain level, no matter how much money you\nspend, it doesn't matter. There is too much concentra.Ubn\" of poor kids with huge problems ranging from\nXfaigs to violence to learning disabilities.\n.^ \"At a certain stage, people just give up on solving\nproblems,\" he said. \"They see schools primarily as an\n«flployment arena; it gets very cynical.\"\n\"\"That has been evident in recently defeated school re\"tteenda around the country. Many middle- and upper-income taxpayers don't want to pay more taxes for schools\nthey don't use. Others, disheartened by reports of inept\nleadership, feel it's useless to pour in more money.\n•\"\"Ih Newark, NJ., for instance, the public schools were\n•p&ced in bankruptcy this month amid accusations of\nmismanagement. Newark was spending more than\n^f»,000 for each child—close to a national record.\n• -\"Newark is an exception,\" said Casserly, who has calculated that city schools, on average, now have $900\nIBS* for each student than suburban schools. \"The\n•wealthier largely have abandoned city public schools\nfind then walked away from them financially and are\nnow blaming them for the results.\"\n\" In recent days in Philadelphia and Chicago, there have\n'tteen dire warnings that popular extracurricular pro•grams might have to be cut because of money problems.\n• In the District, Schools Superintendent Franklin L.\n<6nuth announced plans this month to cut as many as\n•600 positions, including English, art and music teachMeanwhile, many District residents complain about\n•AT administrative staff that has doubled since 1970\nwhile the enrollment has dropped 45 percent.\n•w*Part of the reason for the increased administrative\n-iftttrhead in city schools is the increased need for special\n.programs to serve a more disadvantaged enrollment.\n::*When the comptroller of Atlanta Schools opened his\n'books to a reporter, he ran down a list of needs that\n»have nothing to do with reading and writing:\n• * $8 million for transporting low-income students;\nr4i:$2 million for free breakfasts and lunches for students whose family income falls below the poverty line;\n• $2 million for security personnel (metal detectors\nwere added this year);\n••4400,000 for child care.\n— Comptroller J.

And, he said, \"there is a tremendous increase in special education teachers.\"\nChildren with behavioral, mental and speech problems must be taught in classes of four or five instead of\nthe standard class size of 22 to 35.\nAs these kind of expenses grow wildly, the 1993\nschool budget notes a $1.7 million cut in textbook funding, bringing the current expenditure on books to $18\nper child. The reason: fewer state dollars.\nThe changing demographics of big city schools intentionally were not tracked by the Republican administrations in the 1980s, according to experts who study\nwhat has happened to city schools. But now, as the\nUnited States' urban problems reach critical condition,\nmore officials are looking into the classrooms and finding rows of poor children with expensive problems.\nThe trend is national, but there are notable exceptions.\nIn New York City, for instance, several public schools,\nincluding Hunter College High and Stuyvesant High, are\nconsidered among the best—public or private—in the\ncountry. In the District, Jefferson Junior High in Southwest academically ranks with the best, as does the Duke\nEllington School of the Arts in Northwest.\nThere are still white parents like Joan Walters, who\ncan afford to send her children to any school but insists\non public schools. \"There is a tendency for people to be\nmore separate, by religion or race or class,\" she said. \"I\ndon't think that direction is productive or healthy.\"\nWalters, co-chairwoman of the Inman PTA, said she\nis with the \"core of very, very committed in-town parents who believe public education should be a strong\noption.\" Her daughters, she said, get a good academic\neducation, plus the richness of growing up with children\nof differing backgrounds.\nInman is one of Atlanta's most integrated schools—\n200 of 700 students are white. Still. Principal Barbara\nNaylor says she knows some parents in the well-off\nneighborhood around Inman have a negative view of i t\n\"There is a perception, brought on by Techwood, (a\npublic housing project), that there is violence. It is greatly perceived and greatly wrong,\" she said.\nAt her brick school, which rests on a hill overlooking\ndowntown Atlanta, there are no weapons and no drugs,\nshe said. It offers advantages most private schools\ncouldn't hope for, such as resources, tutors and computers from local colleges and businesses.\nThere is a rousing 140-member band and such diversity in the classroom that there is even a child with\nDown's syndrome whom all the children know. That's\nthe real world,\" Naylor said.\nA mile or so away at Paideia, the scene is quite different. The main administration building is a converted\nTudor mansion. The huge oaks and maples that shade the\nother buildings, the classrooms, the state-of-art theater,\nthe gym, create the feel of a New England prep school.\nThere are smaller classes, more teachers with advanced degrees, and a long waiting list The tuitkn\nvaries by grade and is around $6,000 for the second\ngrade. A published list of where its graduates go includes Princeton, Harvard and Yale.\n\"Private schools have made a killing. They don't have\nto scout for students like they once did,\" said H. Mark\nHuie, the historian of the Atlanta school system, as he\nsat surrounded by papers documenting the changing\nface of the Atlanta schools. As recently as John F. Kennedy's presidency, Huie said, there were still rigidly\nwhite-only and black-only schools.\nAbout 60 or so public schools have shut down, in part\nbecause birth rates changed and because wealthier families opted for the suburbs and private schools.\n\"There is still a group of bright and motivated students and some excellent teachers\" in the public\nschools, said Milfred, the new private school patron.\n\"But the larger group is not that group.\"\nMONDAY.

From diplomacy to\netiquette to politics to marriage,\nour customs and institutions\ndepend for their survival not\nmerely upon felicitous\nrelationships among human beings\nbut upon the polite falsehoods that\nhelp keep those relationships\nfelicitous. However reluctant we\nmay be to admit it openly, we\nknow in our secret hearts that if\nthere is one thing we cannot\nstomach, it is an excess of\nunvarnished truth.\nIt was in tacit recognition of\nthis reality that Barney Frank\naddressed himself last week to the\nnettlesome question of\nhomosexuals in the armed forces.\nThe Democratic representative\nfrom Massachusetts, himself an\nacknowledged homosexual, would\nprefer that Congress accept\nPresident Clinton's proposal to\nend the ban on homosexuals in the\nmilitary, but he has taken a look at\nthe political facts and concluded\nthat \"if Congress has to choose\nbetween a complete lifting of the\nban or completely enforcing the\nold, very restrictive policy, they'll\ndo the latter\"; he concludes\ntherefore that what reality\ndictates is compromise.\n\"I think when you're in elected\noffice.\" Frank said, \"you do have a\nresponsibility from time to time to\ntell people the truth.\" In this\ninstance, the truth is that for the\nmoment—perhaps, indeed, into\nthe foreseeable future—the best\nway to deal with this particular\nissue is to lie about it. Frank of\ncourse did not put it quite so\nbaldly, since it is also among the\nresponsibilities of public servants\nto represent lies as truths, but\nthere can be no question that he\nwants us to tiptoe around the\nissue by pretending it does not\nexist, which is lying in the form of ,\nself-delusion. It is also a very\nhelpful way out of an\nunnecessarily distracting and\nemotionally debilitating political\nsideshow.\nFrank wants us to adopt \"a\npolicy that says, 'Don't ask, don't\ntell, and don't listen, and don't\ninvestigate,' \" a policy whose\nunderlying assumption is \"Don't\nstart, don't get into the whole\nthing.\" Stop querying military\nrecruits about their sexual\norientation on the one hand, but\nrequire them to keep that\nonentation to themselves on the\nother. \"Let's make it very clear,\"\nFrank says, \"that if you are willing\nto make the sacrifice of not\ntalking about or expressing your\nsexuality while you're on duty in a\nuniform, which I don't think most\npeople are looking to do, off duty\nyou can lead a normal life, you can\nsocialize, you can express your\nsexual orienUtion and suffer no\npenalty for it.\"\nMOWAV. MAY 24.1993\nThis makes such exquisite good\nsense that, predictably, the more\nzealous advocates of the\nhomosexual cause promptly\nrushed out to repudiate it. They\nwant all or nothing: total\nelimination of the ban or no\nchange at all. Presumably their\nstrategy is to mobilize their forces\nby portraying theirs as a struggle\nagainst an intolerant, bullying\nmajority, but it is nothing more\nthan a strategy for defeat. As\nFrank says, \"I don't believe losing\ngloriously—just because you want\nto avoid criticism from\nideologically committed\npeople—is a very responsible way\nto conduct public policy.\"\nWhat the ideologues on both\nsides of the battle fail to\nunderstand is that clear\ndistinctions can and should be\ndrawn between a person's work\nlife and his or her private life. The\nmossbacks on the right insist that\nif a person is homosexual at home\nin bed, he or she must be equally\nso at the wheel of a jeep or on\nnight patrol: a predatory creature\nincapable of setting aside\nperverted sexual passions, a\ncreature forever on the prowl for\nconverts or innocent victims. By\nthe same token the absolutists on\nthe left demand that a person's\nbedtime preferences be accepted\nas inextricable and\napplause-worthy elements of his\nor her worktime persona: A\nhomosexual in bed is a\nhomosexual at work, and must be\nwelcomed as such.\nBoth positions are in equal\nmeasure misguided. A person's\nsexual orientation obviously is an\nimportant part of the whole self,\nbut except in the most extreme\ncases it has no significant bearing\non that person's work—or, for\nthat matter, on many other\naspects of one's \"public\" life.\nExtremists on both sides insist\nthat we drag sex out in the open,\neither to vilify it or to celebrate it;\nwhat Frank's compromise policy\ntacitly acknowledges is that it\nbelongs in private, and that we do\nbetter to lie about it than to\nbecome publicly fixated upon it\nFrank makes another point of\nequal validity. Parallels between\nthe legalrightsof homosexuals\nand those of racial minorities are\nat best dubious, but it certainly is\ntrue that \"in 1954, when the\nSupreme Court said segregation\nwas unconstitutional, they did not\nsay, 'and therefore all schools will\nbe integrated within six months or\na year.' \" Even the most desirable\nsocial change takes time, as the\nfour decades since the Brown\ndecision demonstrates.In the case\nof homosexuality, about which\nprejudice runs at least as deep as\nit does on race, there is every\nreason to anticipate that change\nwill be every bit as incremental\nand, to those most urgently\nawaiting it, as frustrating.\nThe plain truth is that shifts in\npublic attitudes toward what used\nto be described as sexual deviancy\nhave occurred with unexpected\nspeed. Perhaps this is because\nvariations on the sexual norm\noccur both unpredictably and\nuniversally: A middle-class white\nfamily cannot awake one morning\nto the discovery that its\nnatural-born son or daughter is\nblack or Hispanic, but it most\ncertainly can awake to the\ndiscovery that its son or daughter\nis homosexual. Sexual variety cuts\nacross social, racial and economic\nbarriers; the problem thus\ncontains its own solution,\ninasmuch as it requires merely\nthat we accept the potential for\ndeviation that is latent within all\nof us.\nNo doubt this helps explain\nwhy, once we brought the subject\nof homosexuality out of the closet,\nso many people found it so much\neasier to confront than they had\nimagined; the Marine colonel who\nreturned from foreign service to\ndiscover that one of his sons is\nhomosexual is merely an\nespecially dramatic instance of a\nphenomenon to which any family\nis susceptible. Many families are\nlearning—reluctantly, in some\ncases, but learning all the\nsame—that love runs deeper than\noddities of sexual taste, and that\nties of family and friendship are\nstronger than revulsion over the\nbehavior those oddities produce.\nMake no mistake about it,\nthough, there is nothing frivolous\nor transitory about this revulsion.\nThe tolerance that people are\nwilling to extend to those they\nknow is less readily extended to\nthose they do not. This is not a\nmanifestation of a deep-rooted\nhomophobia somehow unique to\nAmericans but simply one of good\nold human nature, which tends to\naccept the familiar particular\nmore easily than the unfamiliar\ngeneral. Americans may have\ncome a long way in extending the\nboundaries of tolerance, but, as\nBarney Frank well knows, those\nboundaries still exist and they\naren't going away anytime soon.\nThat's why Frank's\ncompromise—one that \"improves\nthe situation but doesn't make it\nperfect\"—is so appropriate and\nconunon-sensicaL It allows the\nheterosexual majority to persist in\nthe delusion that homosexuality is\ninsignificant within the armed\nforces while at the same time it\nallows homosexuals to enlist in\nthe services without fear of\npersecution so long as they keep\ntheir sexual orienUtion to\nthemselves. It merely asks them,\nthat is, to keep as quiet about\ntheir amatory affairs as do\n\"normal\" people who in the\nsanctity of their chambers enjoy\nwhips, dildos, chains, handcuffs\nand other pleasurable devices (A\nwhich the Rt Hon.

MAY\n24.1993\n�The Packwood Case Goes On\n^ HE PETITION challenging the seating of\nSen. Bob Packwood. filed in Dec. by 250\nOregonians, was a long shot. Angry that\nthe senator had made it through Election Day\nbefore charges of alleged sexual harassment\nbecame public, and uncertain that the Ethics\nCommittee now investigating the matter would\nrecommend the ultimate punishment of expulsion\nor that there were 67 votes to carry out the\npenalty, the petitioners took an unusual route.\nThey went to the Senate Rules Committee arguing that Sen. Packwood's deception in this matter\nwas the equivalent of election fraud and that he\nshouldn't be seated. This theory never had many\nsupporters, and on Thursday, the committee\nunanimously rejected it.\nKatherine Meyer, the lead attorney for the\npetitioners charges that the committee refused\nto rule in her favor because \"[t]he Senate does\nnot think there is anything wrong with lying and\ncheating and stealing your way into this exclusive\nclub.\" A more likely explanation is the Pandora's\nbox theory put forward by Sen. Diane Feinstein.\nIf the petitioners had succeeded, charges of\nelection fraud because of lies, evasions, failures\nT\nto disclose and the like could be raised by\nchallengers at any time. One such application has\nalready been made concerning the alleged failure\nof Sen. Donald Riegle to reveal information about\nhis savings and loan activities during his 1988\ncampaign. It would be asking for chaos to establish a precedent that elected officials can be\nremoved from office on a simple majority vote for\nreasons that are unclear and assumptions about\nvoter reactions that cannot be proved.\nThe Rules Committee action doesn't clear the\nsenator. Far from it. The Ethics Committee\noperates in secrecy and does not provide the\npublic with progress reports, but presumably its\ninvestigation is proceeding apace. A prompt resolution of the case is important here, not least for\nthe reputation of the committee itself, often\nguilty of long delays and reluctance to move\nagainst peers. The charges are serious. If they\nare true, there must be a strong response. Undue\ndelay, or any hint that the committee intends to\ntreat this kind of conduct as if it were a prank or\nan inconsequential, though embarrassing, indiscretion would be a scandal of its own.\nAwkward Schoolbooks\n1 DUCATORS call it the Huck Finn problem,\nand it crops up reliably every so often when\nchildren first begin reading books that\nattempt to grapple with the racial themes in\nAmerican history. And American history being\nwhat it is, these themes are themselves a regular\nfeature of serious schooling. The latest local\nexample is the protest by a group of Fairfax\nCounty parents and teachers against a historical\nnovel called \"Jump Ship to Freedom\"—a story of\na slave boy during the Revolutionary War—\nwhich uses the device of letting the boy initially\nbe made to consider himself inferior to whites\nand then gradually leam better. It's the early\nportions of the book, in which the word \"nigger\"\nis used, that understandably upset one 11-yearold student who had had the initiative to take the\nbook out of the school library on his own but who\ndidn't get far enough to grasp the purpose of the\ndevice.\nHe also had the initiative to try to do something about it. He went to teachers and parents,\nwho protested. A committee is now considering\nwhether to remove the book from the school\nlibrary, where the sixth-grader found it, and\nwhether it should be used as a teaching tool at all.\nIt's worth emphasizing that there are no villains\nor would-be censors in the picture. The questions\nare ones of parental and pedagogical guidance\nnecessary for an encounter with harsh historical\nlanguage that could, for the unwary child, be\nstartling. A teacher confronted with such a book\nE\nMONDAY. MAY\n24,1993\ncould draw students' attention to the awardwinning author's special note on the use of\nhistorical racist terms such as \"nigger\": \"This\nterm is offensive to modern readers, and we\ncertainly do not mean to be insulting. B u t . . . in\naddition to historical accuracy, it was important\nto use the word to show how Daniel learned\nself-respect and developed self-confidence.\" Students can be invited to think about how society\nhas changed and to consider what role historical\nstories play in helping people appreciate that\nchange. Kids can also leam much about the ways\nto evaluate what a book is trying to convey by\nthese admittedly tricky methods and whether the\nattempt is successful.\nSuch debates are educational in the best sense\nand can help students deal with other such issues\nwhere the questions are similar or partly\nparallel—the many efforts to shield black students from the encounter with The Adventures\nof Huckleberry Finn,\" for example, or in a slightly\ndifferent way the Ontario, Canada protests over\nthe revival of the period-piece musical \"Show\nBoat,\" with its outmoded, condescending racial\nmessages. What won't help, as we hope the\nFairfax authorities will conclude, is to pull such\nbooks off the shelves posthaste or encourage\nstudents to put them down half read. History is\nfull of unsavory things now discarded, but the\nencounter with them is more useful in the long\nterm than avoidance.\nTHE WASHINGTON POST\n�Spending Cuts vs. Tax Increases\nC\nRITICS complain that President Clinton's\nplan for reducing the deficit relies too much\non tax increases and not enough on spending cuts. Spending cuts are put forward as the\nrugged and virtuous approach, tax increases as\nsomehow profligate. But the line between the\ntwo is not as bright as the critics describe. The\nbulk of the cuts that the leading critics currently\npropose would not be outright cuts at all in the\nsense of canceling undertakings that would otherwise occur; they would mainly shift from the\nfederal government to other payers in the society\ncosts that would continue to be incurred.\nNor are even all the outright cuts that they\npropose as different from tax increases as the\nrhetoric suggests. That's so in part because the\ncritics are mainly urging entitlement cuts. In\npolitics, the amounts that the government collects from citizens as taxes and the amounts that\nthe check-writing programs send back out in the\nform of benefits are considered separately. But\neconomists rightly think of them much more as a\nsingle tax-and-transfer system in which checks\nare constantly coming in and going out, often\nfrom and to the same families, the government\nall the while gently redistributing income in the\nsociety.\nThe symbolic argument between the president\nand his critics pits taxes versus spending. The\nsubstantive argument is much narrower. It has to\ndo with changes in the workings of this income\nchurn and with the most ancient and fundamental\nof political issues, who wins and who loses. The\npresident's entire plan would increase federal\ntaxes about 5 percent when fully effective; that's\nwhat all the shouting's about. The leading alternative, by Sen. David Boren and others (see the\nopposite page), would deny about half that; the\ngreat philosophical battles boils down to about\ntwo and half percentage points. Mr. Boren, from\nthe oil state of Oklahoma, seeks mainly to block\nthe president's proposed energy tax and his\nincrease in the Medicare tax for the better-off.\nTo make up the revenues, he proposes spending\ncuts.\nSome would indeed be outright cuts, and not\nminor ones either. A lot of people think too much\nfederal spending is indexed..Mr. Boren would\nbreak the pattern and begin giving Social Security recipients and federal annuitants two percentage points less each year than the full cost-of-\nMONDAY. MAY\nliving increases to which they are accustomed\nnow (though a minimum amount of each month's\nbenefit would continue to be fully indexed to\nprotect the poor). It's a bold idea, but it would go\nabout the business of cutting Social Security\ncosts—if that is the objective—in precisely the\nwrong way. The older you got and the greater\nyour likely need, the less in real terms your\nbenefit would be. The senator and friends would\nalso deny three-fourths of the increase the president proposed in the earned-income tax credit\nthat supplements the wages of the working poor.\nThe president says that no family of a full-time,\nyear-round worker should live in poverty in\nAmerica; that's what the increased credit is\ndesigned to help achieve, and it is the goal that\nMr. Boren would shelve.\nThe other proposed cuts are mostly in Medicare and Medicaid. They aren't gimmicks in the\nsense of being fake. Some are worthy ideas, and\nthey would indeed reduce the deficit—but mainly\nby shifting costs back to a lot of the very people\nthat the senators profess to be protecting against\ntax increases. Medicare beneficiaries, the privately insured and state taxpayers all would likely\npay more so that federal taxpayers could pay\nless. The same thing is true of some of the health\ncare spending cuts in Mr. Clinton's own plan. To\ncut federal health care spending without having\nin place the kind of overall health care reform\nplan on which the president is at work is a little\nlike punching a pillow; the dent you make in one\nplace leads to a bulge in another.\nMr. Boren says that the energy tax would be\nregressive. His own proposals would be even\nmore so. He says to an older citizen, for example,\nwe'll save you from the energy tax—and cut your\nSocial Security benefits while raising your share\nof your health care costs and perhaps driving up\nyour state taxes instead. No doubt the citizen is\ngrateful. The president proposes what his successors deferred too long; he would move against\nthe deficit. Mr. Boren agrees. The only questions\nthen are who will pay and at what window. Tax\nincreases versus spending cuts is at once too\nsimple and too complicated. You pay more when\nyour parent goes to the nursing home, or you pay\nmore at the doctor's office or at the gasoline\npump—or you pay more on April 15. You still\npay. For too long we didn't pay and put it on the\ncredit card, which is the problem.\n21.1993\nTHE W S f c o POST\nA HwT m\n�THE W S IN T N POST\nA HI G O\nMONDAY.

During his sometimes rambling\n\"therapeutic confessional,\" Bush pointed\nout what was right about his presidency.\n\"History will be a kinder, gentler judge\nthan the jury of 1992,\" he said. Bush also\nindicated he didn't know about the\nassassination risk he faced during a visit to\nKuwait last month, but said he would have\ngone anyway: \"It's not a macho thing. But\nthat's how much confidence I have in the\nmen and women who dedicate their lives\nto the Secret Service of the United\nStates.\" When asked about Bill Clinton's\n$200 haircut, Bush didn't directly criticize\nhis successor but noted, \"I know what I\npaid is less than that.\" Bush got paid\n$80,000 for his one-hour talk, according\nto published reports.\n• President Clinton and daughter Chelsea\nstopped traffic yesterday afternoon as\nthey strolled hand-in-hand along\nPennsylvania Avenue.

President Qinton has said he won't\nsubmit the Nafta pact to Congress for the\nrequired ratification vote.\nMickey Kantor, U.S. trade representative, said in a telephone interview that the\ndifferences over the enforcement issue are\n\"serious.\" But he said he still believes the\nside accords can bereached.\"Obviously\nwe didn't expect the Mexican government\nor the Canadian government to agree with\neverything that we would table at the very\nZ -7\nfirst instance,\" he said.\nCanada and Mexico object to puttint\npenalties in the accords because they sa;\nsuch measures would be an infringemen\nof their sovereignty and a potential devici\nfor trade harassment.

Surveys show consumer confidence ebbing. In March, the\nmost recent month available, the government's index of leading economic\nindicators fell sharply.\nDo such developments portend a new\nrecession? Probably not, precisely because the expansion is so weak.\nRecessions normally set in only after the\neconomy has run up against constraints to\nfurther growth. These constraints may be\nfinancial, such as intolerably high interest\nrates, or physical, such as shortages of\nlabor, plant capacity or materials.\nWith the expansion so feeble, sach\nlimits to growth seem unlikely to arise\nin coming months. Accordingly, the\neconomy will probably coadnne to expand, albeit at a lackluster pace,\nthrough the rest of 1993 and very possibly through 1994 as well.\nIndeed, this is the general view of 5\n2\nforecasters polled recently by Blue Chip\nEconomic Indicators, a newsletter based in\nSedona. Ariz. They predict that overall economic activity will keeprisinguntil at least\nthe end of 1994, which is as far into the future\nas the survey peers. N recession is in\no\nsight. Instead, on average, theiforecasters\nlook for growth of 25 annually in the\n.%\ncurrent quarter, followed by larger increases. They forecast gains of 31 in the\n.%\nthird quarter and 32 lo the fourth, and\n.%\nthey expect next year's quarterly gains to\nrange between 28 and 3.1%.\n.%\nThe \"favorable\" factor cited most frequently by the Blue Chip forecasters is\nthe prospect of relatively modest inflation\nand, with that,relativelylow interest rates.\nOn average, the economists expect interest\nrates on three-month Treasury bills, for\nexample, to range during the next year\nbetween 3 , the approximate level in recent\n%\nmonths, and 3.6%.\nThese levels are far below comparable rates that prevailed before any of the five\nrecessions that have struck the economy\nsince the late 1960s.

W-u.i. S T R F F T J I H - R N A I .\nWASHINGTON - Clinton administration officials have tentatively agreed on a\nproposal that would guarantee all Americans a relatively modest health-benefits\npackage, similar to a standard Blue Cross..Blue Shield plan, by 1996.\n, The proposal, which President Clinton\nand his top aides hammered out at a\nthree-hour meeting Thursday night, isn't\nas generous as many of the administration's health advisers had hoped. While\ncovering a wide range of medical services,\nit would require people to make relatively\nhigh out-of-pocket payments.\nBut by embracing the proposal, the\npresident and his advisers rejected an\neven less generous plan advocated at the\nThursday session by Laura Tyson, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Robert Rubin, the\nhead of the White House's National Economic Council. The Tyson-Rubin proposal\nwould have provided essentially the same\nbenefits package, but would have phased it\nin more slowly, preventing it from talcing\nfull effect until the year 2000.\nIn a compromise Thursday night, the\npresident and his advisers agreed that\nbenefits for long-term care and prescription drugs probably would be phased in\nmore slowly than other benefits or financed differently.\nAdministration officials emphasized\nthat none of the decisions made Thursday\nnight are final.\nThe proposal represents the result of\nse' f ral weeks of debate between the preslc • s top economic advisers and his\nh . n-care experts. Many of those experts, interested primarily in providing\nhealth-care security to all Americans, originally wanted a much more generous benefit package. But some of the economic\nadvisers, while recognizing the need to\nprovide health-care security, worried\nabout the cost of such a plan and its effects\non the economy. After coalescing around\nthe compromise plan Thursday, some officials burst into applause.\nThe benefits package the administration is leaning toward, according to several\n.officials, is less generous than about 80% of\n. tbe health plans offered around the country today. That doesn't mean it would offer\nfewer medical services, but rather people's\nout-of-pocket payments would be higher..\nBut officials said they would allow companies that offer more generous packages\nPlease TurntoPage AS, Cbtemfc* ~\nTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL MONDAY, MAY 24, 1993*\nWhite House Officials Endorse\nRelatively Modest Health Plan\nContinued From Page A3\ngrowing doubt on Capitol Hill that he will\nthan the federally guaranteed plan to keep be able to pass a broad health-care reform\ndoing so.\nbill this year.

At that meeting, the Fed's policy-setting open-market committee voted, 10-2, to\nhold short-term interest rates steady and\nto maintain a neutral stance in the weeks\nfollowing. The two dissenters, Fed governors Wayne Angell and Lawrence Lindsey,\nwanted an Immediate increase in rates to\nhead off a possible acceleration of inflation.\nAt the end of each meeting, the Fed\ncommittee makes two decisions: whether\nto alter interest rates immediately and\nwhether to lean toward higher, lower or\nunchanged rates in the weeks ahead. After\nmonths of tilting toward lower rates, the\npanel shifted to a neutral stance in December and maintained that position at its\nMarch meeting.\nDetails of last Tuesday's decision to tilt\ntoward higher rates won't be released until\nearly July. Fed officials, annoyed that the\noutcomes o past meetings have become\nf\npublic, are being tight-lipped. A Fed\nspokesman declined to comment.\nPressures on Prices\nA summary of the March meeting says\nthe Fed officials \"acknowledged that recent price developments bad raised a degree of unease in their minds, and their\nconcerns would rise if the recent pace of\np a c e w e r e gusuwed tu ^\n\" o 0s Immeautety ahead.\"\n<n.\nrhe government readings in April on\nconsumer and producer prices were reassuring, but those issued earlier this month\nweren't. Though many economists contend\nthe economic precursors of inflation aren't\nevident, the Fed is finding it increasingly\ndifficult to ignore signs that the inflation\nrate may be picking up.\nIn March, most Fed officials were expecting inflationary pressures to abate. At\nleast some concluded \"that further modest\ndisinflation remained a reasonable expectation,'' according to the summary. But\nthey were worried by the surge in consumer and producer prices. \"While these\ndevelopments might well prove to be an\naberration rather than a signal of intensifying inflation, they did suggest the need\nto reassess the likelihood of a further\ndecline in inflation and to be alert to\nfurther signs of a sustained upturn,\"\nthe summary added.\nSteady Labor Costs\nAt the time, however, the Fed was\nencouraged that labor costs, adjusted for\nimproved productivity, weren't increasing. That factor, among others, \"led many\nmembers to conclude that recent price\ndevelopments did not provide persuasive\nevidence of a change in the inflation\noutlook.\"\nThe summary points out that some\nofficials were concerned that a pickup In\ninflation would mean the central bank was\nholding short-term Interest rates below the\ninflation rate.\nWhile only Messrs. Undsey and Angell\ncast formal votes In favor of higher rates,\nthe summary suggests that some other Fed\nofficials were sympathetic to the Idea. The\ntwo governors argued, among other\nthings, that raising Interest rates a bit In\nMarch could avoid \"the need for more\nsizable and potentially disruptive\" Increases later.\n<\na\nz\no\nS\nz\nTracking the Economy\nMay 24,1993\nEconomic growth m the list quarter protaMy\natowdewnmore than the QCMHOTntoMglnny; Slowing Qrowtt)?\nestimated because of a larger-tfcafraxpecM Annuallnd parcentag* change in grass\ndomestic product\nhcraaso in tho Manh tmto di&ft. *\n5%r\nTho CoiffTBrce Department HHy rtportad gross\ndomesflc product W value of goods and artoBi\ne\nproduced in the US., gnw at a paby 1 JHk annual\nrate in thefirstquartw.\nBut that estimate was based only on partial dtfa\nand dWnl take into account the $10^1 Mkm i\nMarch trade dsMt tepfftad tet \"\n::\n-\n••••\n-'•cVi -i*!>.?:':••••;&*•\nTMnps waretootoaoproBygood wWfrlpdo\n'nwNter came out/ aWSoraa M<m*«ar\noanonMtoFufrSwrttete.

FRISBY\nS i a f f Reporter of T n r\nWALL STRKET JULRNAL\nWASHINGTON - In one stroke, the firing of the White House travel office has\ntainted the administration, the press corps\nand the seven employees of the office.\nThis could have been a positive story\nfor President Clinton: Looking to reduce\ncosts, his aides found at least inefficiency\nat the travel office, then jettisoned the\nentire staff. But once again, the White\nHouse has been tripped up by not quite\nunderstanding how Washington works.\nAn audit commissioned by the White\nHouse showed that an office handling\nroughly Sll million a year-money that the\nmedia pay for travel with the president and\nother accommodations - had poor record\nkeeping; had no written contract with\nUltrAir Inc., which provided the charter\nairplane for the press, and engaged in\nquestionable recording of petty-cash transactions.\nThe White House reaction was buttressed by a Federal Bureau of Investigation determination that a further criminal\ninvestigation is warranted. But in trying to\njustify their actions. White House officials\nmay have prematurely spoken of criminal\nwrongdoing, putting a cloud over all seven\nformer employees before a full investigation had taken place. Moreover, the FBI\nactions have raised some eyebrows because they come at a time when the\nbureau's director, William Sessions, is\nstruggling to convince the new administration to let him keep his job.\nReporters' Best Friends\nMore broadly, Mr. Qinton's aides\nfailed to grasp the deep-rooted relationship\nbetween the travel office and the press\ncorps. It was press money that may have\nbeen mishandled, but there weren't many\ncomplaints from the press.\nOn the contrary, Billy Dale, the travel\noffice director, and his troops have frequently been the best friends reporters\nhave on the road. Over the years, the staff\nhas moved people and equipment to impossible places, largely on time. Many jour\nnalists suspect that any funds unaccounted\nfor in the KPMG Peat Marwick audit were\nslipped to bellmen, bus drivers and baggage handlers around the world to make\nsure the press got what it needed.\nOne veteran reporter tells of paying\n$200 for two nigs worth $10,000 during a\ntrip to China several years ago. He says\nthat he paid no duties or taxes on the rugs,\nand that Mr. Dale let him put the rugs\non the press plane home. Many reporten\nhave similar tales to tell.\nthe press plane that was arranged by the\nnew travel office earlier in the week was\ndelayed for two hours on its maiden voyage\nSaturday because of a leaky fuel line.\nNo Glory for Press Corps\nStill, members of the press corps didn't\ncover themselves in glory. White House\naides fume at what they saw as unfair\ntreatment by reporters who reacted emotionally to the firings and were more\nconcerned about their friendships and\ntravel accommodations than weeding out\npossible corruption. The main press argument was: Why have all seven employees\nbeen placed under the same cloud?\nMoreover, there were clear signs that\nthe fiasco has cooled the already chilly\nrelations between the admimstration and\nthe press corps. When Mr. Clinton was\nasked about the safety of the charter plane\nthat the press used Saturday, he replied,\n\"It's not my job. The press can take care of\nthemselves.\"\nAn exchange Friday between Mr. Stephanopoulos and Brit Hume, the White\nHouse correspondent for ABC News, exemplified the tension. Mr. Hume noted that\nthe Clinton administration said it was\n\"going to observe the absolute highest,\nmost scrupulous ethical standards. That\nalways has included questions of appearance. Isn't it manifestly clear that for this\nchap [Mr. Watkins] to turn to this fonner\nclient of his for the business, even on an\ninterim basis, creates an obvious appear\nance problem - just an appearance problem?\"\nMr. Stephanopoulos would respond only\nthat the administration will continue to\nreview the situation.\nGeorge Condon, the president of the\nWhite House Correspondents Association,\ndefends his colleagues as professionals,\nbut says the history shows that \"a press\ncorps that has been avoided and ignored\nand treated in a way that is Nixonian is not\ngoing to cut [the president) any breaks.\"\nEnter the Clinton administration.\nEven the travel office workers have\nquietly acknowledged they were the likely\ntargets for dismissal because they serve at\nthe pleasure of the president. It would have\nbeen a one-day story except that when the\nClinton officials fired the press's best\nfriends, they called on their own pals.\nThe president turned the office over to\nCatherine Cornelius, a 25-year-old distant\ncousin. Television producer Harry Thomason - a friend of the president's - and his\npartner appeared to seek business for\ntheir own charter consulting business. And\nwhom did the White House get to help out\nin the interim but World Wide Travel\nInc. - a Little Rock, Ark., agency whose\nowners have contributed to Mr. Clinton in\nthe past and whose billing practices on the\npresidential campaign have been criticized?\nFurther. David Watkins, the director of\nadministration in the White House, has\nclose ties to World Wide: It was once a\nclient of his when he was in advertising,\nand he is friends with the owners. It was\nMr. Watkins who fired the travel office.\nSmell of Premeditation\nIt all has the smell of premeditation.\nMs. Cornelius, who had used World Wide\nwhen handling press traveling arrangements during the campaign, wrote a memo\nto Mr. Watkins in February suggesting\nthat six of the seven travel office workers\nbe fired and that she and a friend be placed\nin charge. Her memo infuriated journalists by contending that the travel office\nwas \"overly pro-press.\"\nThis shouldn't be overshadowing Mr.\nQinton's fight for his budget or health-care\noverhaul or Bosnian poUcy. But these\nevents - like the haircut by Christophe of\nBeverly HlDs on the nmway in Los Angeles - have raised anew questions of\nwhether Mr. Clinton shares the values of\nmost Americans.\nAt a testy briefing Friday, George\nStephanopoulos. the communications director, refused to concede that these circumstances presented a perception problem. But later World Wide Travel was\nremoved from any Involvement in White\nHouse travel arrangements. Meanwhile.\n�Clinton Officials\nWeigh Transfer\nFor FBI Chief /\nBy JOE DAVIDSON\nMall'\nfirporrcr\n,\nn' I'm W M I. STMM- T J I T K N U .\nWASHINGTON - Attorney General Janet Reno said administration officials are\nconsidering whether to transfer FBI Director William Sessions, who has been accused of ethical violations, into another\nfederal job.\nPeople have discussed that.\" she said\nin an interview. But she said she didn't\nknow the likelihood of that occurring.\nTen weeks after declaring the status of\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation director a top priority, Ms. Reno met briefly\nFriday with Mr. Sessions to discuss the\nallegations against him.\nFollowing the meeting, which also included Mr. Sessions's lawyers and Deputy\nAttorney General-designate Philip Heymann, Mr. Sessions issued a statement\nasserting he had \"confidence that Attorney General Reno would fully and fairly\nconsider all the issues.\"\nThrough a spokesman, Ms. Reno said,\n\"I'll review the matter.\"\nMr. Sessions is 5'4 years through his\n10-year term. He can be removed from his\npost only by the president.\nThe delay in reaching a decision on Mr.\nSessions's leadership of the FBI may be\nrelated to Ms. Reno's desire to have Mr.\nHeymann's views on the issue before she\nmakes a recommendation to President\nClinton. Mr. Heymann's nomination likely\nwill be confirmed this week by the Senate.\nAs deputy attorney general, he would have\nauthority over the bureau.\nBut any delay works to the benefit of\nMr. Sessions, because it reinforces the\nview that his dismissal isn't necessary for\nthe bureau to function smoothly. On a\nmore personal level, the longer Mr. Sessions, 62 years old, remains in government\nservice, the bigger his pension would\ngrow.\nThe meeting with Ms. Reno comes as\nthe FBI is investigating allegations of\nfinancial irregularities in the White House\ntravel office. An FBI spokesman said the\nbureau today will begin reviewing an audit\nof the travel office completed Saturday by\na private accounting firm.\nWhile many believe Mr. Sessions had\nlapses in judgment, some Democrats initially speculated the accusations against\nhim were linked to alleged resentment by\nMr. Barr over Mr. Sessions's statements\nlast fall regarding an FBI inquiry into the\nJustice Department's handling of the\nBanca Nazionale del Lavoro investigation.\nThe BNL scandal involved a $4 billion bank\nfraud in which some money was used to\nfinance secret arms sales to Iraq. Mr. Barr\nadamantly denied that there was any\nresentment or any link between BNL and\nthe accusations against Mr. Sessions.\nAccording to the report, Mr. Sessions,\namong other things:\n• Used a \"sham\" arrangement to avoid\npaying income taxes on the value of his\ngovernment-supplied, door-to-door transportation.

The Clinton administration\nis under pressure to set environmental\npriorities and direct money accordingly.\nThe EPA has been forced into its questionable spending pattern by a series of\nexplicit laws passed over the past 20\nyears by a largely Democratic Congress\nthat didn't trust Republican administrations on environmental issues.\nCongress has also used the EPA's S\n7\nbillion annual budget at times as a pork\nbarrel, requiring spending on projects\nthat, while worthwhile, don't attack the\nmost serious environmental problems, the\nreport maintains. And environmental activists have contributed to the agency's\nlack of spending flexibility by frequently\nfiling lawsuits that result in court orders\nforcing the EPA to spend money to enforce\nspecific laws.\nThe agency's structural problem seems\nunlikely to be corrected any time soon by\nthe Clinton administration. That could\nmake it tough to fulfill campaign promises\nto vastly improve the government's efforts\nto protect the environment.\nSimply boosting spending on all fronts\nisn't an option.

But spending patterns are\nlittle changed because of the rigid laws.\n\"EPA needs to tear up all the enviromental laws and come up with a central\nlaw that addresses pollutants on a priority\nbasis,\" says Marc Smolensky, director\nof the center's enviromental-budget-priorities project.\nFormer EPA chief William D. Ruckelshaus echoes that sentiment. He says the\nagency would be better off with an umbrella law. \"What Congress should do is\ngive the agency a lot more flexibility, and\nthen exercise oversight,\" he says.\nIn response, Mike Vandenberg, a senior policy adviser to the EPA, says the\nagency favors altering congressionally set\npriorities when they no longer make sense,\nbut that doing so is \"a long-term evolutionary process.\"\nMore than half the EPA's current\nPlease Tum lo Page B6, Column 5\nTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL MONDAY.

More\nfrightening contamination - air pollution,\nradon in homes, destruction of the ozone\nlayer and global warming - receive relatively small amounts of money.\nThe Clinton administration's proposed\nEPA budget tor next year contains no\nemormous changes'' in how budget priori;ies compare with areas of scientific concern, says Derry Allen, acting director of\nthe EPA's office of strategic planning and\nenvironmental data. \" I haven't seen any\ninnovative ideas from the Clinton team\nabout how to tum EPA around,\" Mr.\nSmolensky says.\nDrawing on scientific risk analyses and\npolling data from the EPA. the new study\nargues that the agency's budget priorities\nare more closely aligned with popular\nnotions about threats to the environment\nthan with the threats themselves.\nPollution that can be seen and that is\nlocal, such as old dump sites, is considered\na high-risk threat by the public, though the\nScience Advisory Board ranks old dump\nsites as a less serious threat. At the same\ntime, these scientists rank radon in homes\nas a high risk to human health, though\npublic concern is low.\nPublic Opinion\nConvincing Congress that money\nshould follow science and not the prevailing public sentiment could be difficult.\nSen. Max Baucus. the new chairman of the\nSenate Environment and Public Works\nCommittee, bluntly asserts that where\nscience differs from public opinion, the\nanswer isn't necessarily to side with science. \"We do live in a democracy,\" he\nsays. \"The constitution doesn't say scientists should be elected to Congress. It says\npeople should be elected to Congress.\"\nShort on cash and long on congressionally imposed duties, the EPA is constantly being sued by environmental\ngroups over one missed statutory deadline\nor another.\nAt a recent congressional hearing. EPA\nAdministrator Carol Browner estunated\nthat legal costs eat up 20% of the agency's\nair-quality budget. \"The litigation is essentially setting the priorities,\" Ms.\nBrowner said. The EPA's acbons are so\noften dictated by court orders that Sen.\nBaucus describes the agency as being in\nTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL MONDAY.

In a March appearance on Capitol\nHill, Ms. Browner said she was \"appalled\"\nby how the agency had handled contracts.\n\"Mismanagement of extramural resources\nis widespread and deeply embedded in the\nagency,\" she said.\nMr. Ruckelshaus, the agency's first\nchief, says mistrust was already high\nwhen the agency was set up under Richard\nNixon, and that has worsened since.\nCongress set very detailed and perhaps\nunrealistic standards for reducing pollution: the EPA couldn't meet the deadlines\nor the goals; Congress became more dubious about the agency. He adds: \"One way\nto read the environmental laws of this\ncountry is as an expression of a lack of\ntrust of the executive branch by the legislative branch.\"\nVery Precise\nThe waste, air and water acts, which\nsometimes overlap in the application and\nenforcement, are very precise. But they\ndon't form a coherent policy, according to\nF. Henry Habicht II, who was deputy\nEPA administrator in the Bush administration. \"You can't staple all these rules\ntogether and say you have a policy.\"\nCongress also limits EPA flexibility by\nearmarking in the budget money for certain projects. About 1 % of 1993 EPA\n0\ndollars is earmarked, according to the\nreport. Bob Traxler. a now-retired Michigan Democrat who headed the House appropriations subcommittee that handles\nthe EPA's budget, earmarked about $105\nmillion for a fresh-waterrresearch center\nto be built in his district, the report notes,\nsaying: \"Although this may be a worthwhile project, it appears to be a questionable use of funding priorities.\" Mr. Traxler\ncouldn't bereachedfor comment.\nAn EPA official in Chicago says the Bay\nCity. Mich., research center already has a\nsupercomputer operating - the world's\nonly one dedicated solely to erivironmentar\nresearch - and that a new dock is being\nbuilt there for the agency's Great Lakes\nship. The center's specific research mission, however, hasn't been decided.\nThe report recommends beefing up\nEPA research so it can study more kinds of\npollution, rank them according to risk and\nthen allocate money to the most serious\nthreat. Mr. Ruckelshaus, who has read a\nsummary of the report, notes that such\nstudies, which often involve testing both\nanimals and humans and measuring exposure levels, typically take years to complete. And even then, there is often disagreement between scientists about the\nresults.\nThe center also says the agency needs\nto better assess how effective its programs\nare in protecting the environment. \"Instead, it evaluates its programs by conducting bean-counting exercises: how\nmany permits were issued; how many\ninspections were conducted; how many\nregulations were written; how many enforcement notices were issued.''\nMr. Vandenberg, speaking for the EPA,\nsays he hasn't yet read the new report. He\nadds that the EPA views risk assessment\nas important, and notes that its 1994\nbudget proposal includes a doubling of\nmoney to combat lead poisoning, a health\nproblem often identified as far more serious than its funding level suggests. But he\ndeclines to name any area within the\nagency as overfunded.\n�Pass National Service, Cripple Charity\nBy BRUCE CHAPMAN\nN\nO\nSurveys by the Gallup Poll and Independent Sector show that charitable giving and service are thriving today as seldom before. In 1991, the latest year for\nwhich data are available, 94.2 million\nAmericans age 18 and over volunteered in\nsome capacity, with an average of more\nthan 4.2 hours of service per week. The\nmotive force is a spirit of true voluntarism\nand genuine service.\nDrawing on a moral tradition going\nback to the Bible, and wending through\nthe American founding and the young republic described by Alexis de TocquevUle,\nthis Ideal has created what some call a\n\"mediating\" institution between the\nprofit sector and the government. Now the\ngovernment proposes not only to compete\nwith this sector (as in the Vista program),\nbut to Invade it directly.\nRemember CETA\nUnder President Clinton's national service bill, politically appointed boards chosen by state governors would funnel federal funds for service jobs to selected pri. vate and civic groups. Imagine you run a\nprivate charity. If it Is chosen to participate in the national service program,\nyou've hit the jackpot financially. But if\nyour charity, like tbe great majority, is\nnot chosen, your cause will find itself trying to compete with the federal treasury.\nAmericans familiar with the notorious\nComprehensive Employment and Traintag Act of the 19708 should And the\nprospects for unabashed political patronage, and eveta corruption, obvious.\nIncapacitating the nongovernment\ncharitable sector further, tbe national service bill allows (read, \"encourages\") the\nprograms It backs to raise additional\nfunds from private sources. Imagine trying to raise money for a private charity\nwhen the government's endorsed charities, blessed by your state's governor, can\noffer d rs federal \"matching money.\"\nprestige and public recognltfyn incen-\ntives to fund them instead.\nNational-service-backed groups also\nwill be allowed to add private charitable\nfunds to the governmeht salary offered to\nattract volunteers. Tax-free national service salaries alone will be about $20,000 an\nnually, including medical and other benefits (such as child care) and the $5,000 college loan payment. With the governmentpermitted private match, salaries could\nexceed $29,000.\nThat is more than most youths could\nhope to make starting out in the private\nmium, increasingly, will be on \"professionalizing\" volunteer service in order to\nobtain federal dollars. But it is the amateur, unbureaucratic charities that typically are the most innovative.\nTocqueville, in praising the energy and\ndistinction of America's \"voluntary associations,\" warned: \"Once it leaves the\nsphere of politics to launch out on this new\ntrack, I government] will, even without intending this, exercise an intolerable\ntyranny. For a government can only dictate precise rules. It Imposes the senti-\nImagine trying to raise money for a private charity\nwhen government-endorsed charities can offer donors federal \"matching money,\" prestige and public recognition.\nsector, where the median income of workers, including those with years of experience, is $29,400 for males and $20,500 for\nfemales. It is surely far more than most\nprivate charities could offer them. Thus,\nas national service makes selected charitable causes more attractive to volunteers\nand donors, it automatically will make\nothers less so.\nOne sees this especially in respect to\nreligious organizations, now the source of\nroughly half of all charitable activities.\nBecause of understandable concerns over\nseparation of church and state, national\nservice will not support any programs that\nprovide \"religious instruction, conduct\nworship services or proselytize.\" But. effectively, that means that a church or synagogue running a youth leadership program or day-care center will be at a disadvantage against comparable national service programs. Quickly, the pressure will\nbe on religious groups to secularize or\nspin off their service programs to make\nthem appealing to national service.\nMoreover, the president's bill is full of\nfederal paperwork obligations, so the pre-\nments and ideas which it favors, and it is\nnever easy to tell the difference between\nits advice and its commands.\"\nIndeed, much of the intellectual argument for national service expressly rejects\nthe Tocquevillean tradition. Rutgers Prof.\nBenjamin Barber, whose contribution to\nthe idea of national service was hailed by\nPresident Clinton when he announced the\nplan, is a critic of limited government, capitalism and representative (\"thin\")\ndemocracy. He argues instead for institutions of \"strong democracy,\" including,\nultimately, compulsory universal citizen\nservice in government-run programs.\nMost private, independent efforts, he believes, \"encourage self-interestedness.\"\nAnother champion of national service,\nmuch admired at the White House, is\nMichael Brown, co-director of Boston's\nCity Year. He has been an Influential advocate of seeking private as well as public\nmoney for national service programs and\nof the National Service Trust Fund picking\nprivate charity programs to back, rather\nthan running service programs itself.\n\"In this way,\" Mr. Brown wrote re-\ncently, \"the American people sliouhl be\ngiven the opportunily to fall in love with\nthe idea of the National Service Trust\nFund, and not have their affe< linns tied tn\nthe success or failure of any specific national service program. . . . Like Social Security, national service will be woven into\nthe fabric of American life.\"\nCongressional hearings on Piesident\nClinton's national service plan and the\npublic relations campaign advancing it almost always bring forward as spokesmen\nyoung, ingenuous participants in private\ncharities. This approach, with idealistic\nteacher's aides or student tree-planters\nmaking the pilch for a new government\nprogram, is affecting. But these ad\nmirable youngsters are not the organizei-s\nof the scheme, and they are not likely to\nunderstand its long-term implications for\nthe voluntary sector as a whole. Neither,\napparently, does much of the disorganized\nopposition.\nThe Greatest Danger\nOpponents of the plan seem to think the\nmain problems are the addition to the\ndeficit ($400 million this year, $7 billion hy\n1997); the moral contradiction of paying fur\n\"service\" when no risk or inconvenience is\nentailed (unlike military service or the\nPeace Corps); and the failure of the plan to\ncover more than 1% of the student population with its payment of as much as $10,000\nin college loans for two years' governmentapproved service. These difficulties are all\ngenuine, but not the greatest danger. The\nattack on the voluntary sector is.\nNational service reportedly is on a\n\"fast track\" in Congress. However, the\nvoluntary sector and its supporters-other\nthan those organizations that hope to benefit directly from federal funds-apparently do not understand yet what is about\nto hit them.\n3\"\nW\nCM\n3\nC-I\nO\n2\no\n>\nN3\nMr. Chapman is president of Discowry\nInstitute, a public policy center in Seattle.\nCO\n�The World Wails While Clinton Flails\neconomy.

It's not fair.\"\nLiberal Democrats, particularly\nminority members of Congress,\ncould not agree more. Their opposition to cuts in entitlement spending\nis as rooted in local politics as is the\ncentrists' desire to cut them.\nNearly half of the government's\n$1.5 trillion budget in 1994 will be\ndevoted to so called mandatory programs. The fastest growing programs are Medicaid, a joint federalstate health program for the poor,\nand Medicare, a federal program\nthat delivers primary and supplemental health care to the elderly.\nCombined, the two programs cost\n$167 billion in 1991, compared with\n$116 billion in 1988. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the\ntwo programs will cost $349 billion\nby 1997.\nLiberals believe government\nspending has been cut enough this\nyear. They point to the freeze in discretionary spending that Congress\nforced the White House to accept in\nits five-year economic plan.\nDiscretionary spending accounts\nfor about a third of all federal spending. It includes funds for education,\nhousing, health care and other programs liberals believe are vital.\nLiberal Democrats are adamant\nin opposing cuts in entitlement programs.

Instead, they want\na clear distinction between Serbian,\nMuslim and Croatian zones.\nIt was apparently with this idea in\nmind that the concept of \"ethnic\ncleansing\" started, during which\nMuslims were forced out of villages\nand towns, to make them ethnically\nhomogenuous. Croats also have used\nthe practice, but to a somewhat\nlesser extent than the Serbs.\nThus, to the outside world, the\nSerbs bacame the villains of the civil\nwar, which at first pitted them\nagainst Slovenes and Croats and\nthen set the ethnically mixed republic of Bosnia on fire.\nObsessed by their tortuous history, the Serbs were the main inspiration for the Yugoslav federation,\nwhich managed to survive by 11\nyears the death of Marshal Josip\nBroz Tito, \"the first and last true\nYugoslav.\"\nThey blame the civil war on two\nmain factors: the split of Slovenia\nand Croatia in 1991 despite Serbian\nrequests for a temporary confederation pending negotiations, and their\nrecognition by Germany, which, in\nturn, prompted other European\ncountries to follow suit.\nSerbian nationalists often regard\nGermany as a sinister power, heir to\nthe Nazi tradition, which wants to\nexpand its influence in the Balkans\nusing Roman Catholic Croatia and\nSlovenia as its proxies.\nOf the 8 million Serbs in the former Yugoslavia, slightly more than\n3 million live outside the borders of\nSerbia. Hundreds of thousands were\nslaughtered by pro-Nazi Croats during World War I I — the tragedy\nwhose memories still haunt Serbs.\nSome Serbs were killed by Muslim fascists in Sarajevo after the\nNazi conquest.\nSerbian nationalism was held in\ncheck by Tito, who treated Yugoslavia's ethnic groups in a conspicuously\neven-handed manner. After his\ndeath in 1980, the clamor for a\n\"greater Serbia\" became the watchword of many Serbs — causing a\npredictable Croatian backlash.\n�Panel to study labor relafons\nMARCHING\nWith the strong backing of organized\nlabor and a heavy dose of skepticism\nfrom the business community, the Com\nmission for the Future of WorkerManagement Relations reports to work\ntoday.\nLabor Secretary Robert Reich and\nCommerce Secretary Ronald Brown\nhave given the panel the job of examining\nthe state of labor relations in the United\nStates and \"find ways for labor and management to work together to enhance\ntheir common interests,\" in Mr. Reich's\nwords.\nBut the 10 member commission,\nchaired by former Labor Secretary John\nDunlop, who served in the Ford adminis\ntration, has already drawn fire from\nsome management groups, who charge\nLABORS\nFrom page B4\nXerox is unionized and has often\nbeen cited as the corporate world's\npremier example of union manage\nment cooperation to improve productivity and create workplace part\nnerships.

I don't think it has much bite\neither way,\" said the Florida Democrat.\nStatehood supporters say Mr. Graham's opinion sums up the lack of\nurgency demonstrated by federal\nlawmakers toward relinquishing\ncontrol of the city. That's why last\nweek's announcement to hold Senate\nhearings on statehood legislation\nwas greeted by city officials with\nsuperlatives normally reserved for\nElection Day victories.\n\"This action is especially significant because statehood has been all\nbut a dead letter in the Senate. This\nis truly a significant step to hear it,\nmuch less act on it,\" said D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton.\nSenate Majority Leader George\nMitchell, Maine Democrat, announced Wednesday that the Governmental Affairs Committee would\nhold public hearings by the fall oh a\nbill universally backed by city leadera. It will be the first time the Senate has taken action on statehood leg-\nislation.\nCity officials, who are overwhelmingly Democratic, are optimistic a Democratic White House\nthat publicly backs statehood will rekindle interest in an idea that has\nbeen dormant on Capitol Hill during\nthe last decade.\n\"It's a historic occasion and a\nclear acknowledgment that there\nmay be problems with the lack of\nsovereignty and a lack of voting\nrights irregardless of what happens,\" said council member Kevin\nChavous, who chairs the D.C.

A majority of Repub\nlicans are opposed to statehood because the city would in all likelihood\nsend three Democratic representatives to Congress And many Demo\ncrats like Mr. Graham question the\nconstitutionality of the measure.\nOnly half of the eight Democratic\nmembers of the Governmental Af\nfairs Committee are considered receptive to the idea, while all five Republicans are expected to vote\nagainst it.\nNeither of the two Democratic\nsenators who will co-chair the hearing are on record as suppporting\nstatehood.

Most significantly, the\nHouse Ways and Means Committee\napproved the administration's proposals for higher levies on business\nand the wealthy.\nCongress could still say no. however, yielding to pressures from a\nbipartisan Senate taction that has\nproposed an alternative budgetcutting package.\nIt is bad enough that President\nClinton wants to provide spendthrift\nUncle Sam with more money, but he\nproposes doing so for the worst of\nreasons: to reignite a class war, under the cuise of patriotic \"sacrifice,\"\nfor partisan gain. Democrats have\nlong criticized the 1980s as the decade of greed, but Mr. Clinton is working to turn the 1990s into the decade\nof envy.\n\"Before I ask working Americans\nto work harder and pay more,\" he\ntold the nation in February, \" I will\nask the economic elite who made\nmore money and paid less in taxes to\npay their fair share.\" Thus, many of\nhis proposed tax hikes, especially a\nhigher corporate rate, a higher personal rate for top earners, and a surtax on those with the highest incomes, are directed at business and\nthe \"rich.\" Some Democrats would\ngo even further. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser, for instance, wants to reverse the effects\nof Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cut that,\nMr. Sasser claims, \"distributed its\nbenefits disproportionately among\nthe rich and the very rich.\" Mr. Sasser proposes raising the top marginal rate still further, lifting the\nMedicare tax cap, and imposing a\nsurtax on far more people.\nthe same proportion of every one's\nincome, would be much more fair. It\nwould also do a better job of making\neveryone pay for government s operations and thereby realize that there\nis no \"free lunch.\" The more progressive the tax code, the easier for\nmajorities and influential minorities\nto unfairly loot, wealthier classes.\n\"Business'' taxes suffer from a\nsimilar failing Since corporations\ncollect lather than pay government\nlevies, the real victims — customers,\nemployees, shareholders — don't\nknow their pockets are being picked.\nAs a result, the corporate income tax\nhas become a favorite class war\nweapon.\nThe problem might not he so serious if we didn t live in an age of\nenvy. Greed is bad enough, eating\naway at a person's soul. Envy is far\nworse, however, because it destroys\ncommunities as well as individuals,\npoisoning relations as everyone at-\nT\nMr. Sasser's claims are not onlv\ndemagogic but also deceitful. The\nReagan tax break, an across-theboard 25 percent rate reduction,\nprovided more in tax cuts to the rich\nonly because the rich were paying so\nmuch more in taxes.

Is that fair?\nIn any case, higher marginal\nrates quickly become self-defeating:\nPeople are discouraged from working and investing at all. preferring to\nconsume, often conspicuously;\nhigher earners are also encouraged\nto spend significant resources in tax\navoidance activities, wasting money\nin order to shelter a little more from\nthe tax man.\nMoreover, attempts to \"soak the\nrich\" will hurt the poor — by reduc-\ning the availability of private investment capital for job creation. President Clinton worries about a credit\ncrunch, yet his plan to seize a larger\nshare of corporate earnings will obviously reduce investment funds.\nMoreover, hitting wealthy taxpayers\nwill cut thie money that the business\nsector needs to expand.

David Ricardo. the leading economist of that era. dismissed\nthe idea as ridiculous.\nRicardo understood that no such\nfund had any meaning unless it was\n\"derived from the excess of the public revenue over the public expenditure.\" Then, as now. this fund was\n• only such in name\" for \"there is no\nexcess of revenue above expendI iture.\"\nIn other words, unless your in' come is greater than your spending,\nvou are not actually saving anything,\nno matter what you put in what account.\nSetting aside a fund while gomg\ndeeper into debt is like putting $100\nin your bank account while charging\n$1,000 on your credit card. You may\ncongratulate vourself on your growing bank balance, but in reality you\nare going $900 deeper in the hole.\nSlick Willie wants to run the government the way plastic junkies\nabuse their credit cards.

Instead, there was wild enthusiasm for\ndistributing \"the peace dividend\" as\ngoodies to be handed out by politicians to win votes.\nWhen President Bush was suckered into agreeing to the 1990 \"deficit reduction\" tax increases, was the\ndeficit reduced? Of course not.\nAfter Bill Clinton entered the\nWhite House, talking about \"reducing health care costs,\" it has been\nonly a few short months before he\nhas started talking about raising\ntaxes to pay for these \"reduced\"\nhealth care costs.\nThe way to reduce spending is to\nreduce spending — not to reduce\nprojected increases in spending, not\nto promise spending cuts years after\nthe tax increases, not to name deficits for presidents when they are\nproduced by Congress, or any of the\nother gimmicks that clever people\nthink up in Washington.\nThe best kept secret inside the\nBeltway is that government revenues have been rising by hundreds\nof billions of dollars throughout the\nyears when the national debt has\nbeen skyrocketing. Without touching the tax laws, the government will\nreceive tens of billions of dollars\nmore this year, simply from the\ngrowth of the economy and the additional tax revenues that this automatically brings in.\nYou will know that the politicians\nare finally getting serious about reducing the deficit and bringing\ndown the national debt when you see\nthem reducing total spending. Perhaps some members of the younger\ngeneration may live to see that day,\nif they live very long lives.\nUntil then, whenever Washington\npoliticians start talking about the\ndeficit, translate that as higher\ntaxes, because that's the real bottom\nline.\nsee SOWELL, page E4\nThomas Sowell, an economist\nand a senior fellow at the Hoover\nInstitution, is a nationally syndicated columnist.\nMONDAY, MAY 24, 1993 *\n76\n�PAT BUCHANAN\nFirst Amendment choking on ivy\nJ\nRottenfruitfromseeds of Berkeley ' BUCHANAN\nI\nt was near midnight, m January\nKden Jacobowitz. a freshman\nat the University of Pennsylvania, was working on a term paper Below his sixth-floor dorm window, five black sorority sisters all\nbegan -shouting, stomping, singing\nand screaming things like woo,\nwoo,'\" says Mr. Jacobowitz.

Thc movement, called\nUNITA, is led by Jonas Savimbi, who\ncan also be described as ruthless\nand treacherous Plus power mad\nand racist.\nWhy Mr Clinton would bother\nchoosing between the two is hard to\nfathom But he followed thc advice\nof the State Department, which be\nlicves that Jose Eduardo Dos Santos,\na Moscow-trained engineer, was\nhonesily elected president last Sep\ntember.\nHi start Angola's tragedy, go back\nto ISS.t. when the Portuguese arrived to ply Ihe slave trade Portugal\ndid its usual rotten job of colonization, exploiting the rich land and\nleaving 90 percent of Angolans illit\nerate when it departed in IW7.S.\nPower was seized by the Popular\nMovement lor the Libei alion of Angola, a commiinisl group known as\nMPLA and hacked by dO.OOO Cuban\ntroops and Soviet \"advisers.\" Mr\nSavimbi's UNITA retreated to the\nH../.

They managed to overlook his little faults, like hating while\nand mixed-race Angolans\nThc war killed between 350,000\nand 500.000 people, mostly civilians.\nThe country of 10 million has the\nworld's highest percentage of amputees, due to land mines spread freely\nhy MPLA and UNITA.\nIn 1991, the United States, Soviet\nUnion, Portugal and the United Nations brokered a peace accord. Under its terms, both armies were to\ndemobilize, which they did only partially, and Messrs. Dos Santos and\nSavimbi were to square off in an\nelection.\nThe mainstream American press\nhas a simple tale about what is supposed to have happened next. It goes\nlike this: \"Dos Santos won, 49 percent to 40 percent. The U.N. certified\nthe election as 'generally free and\nfair' Savimbi charged fraud and returned to the battlefield.\"\nThe truth is more complicated. A\nU N . electoral commission said\nMPLA vote-rigging \"significantly\ndistorted\" the results. But U.N.\nhigher-ups had not budgeted for another election and did not want to\nadmit faulty poll-watching. Hence\nthe declaration of \"free and fair.\"\nAlso, while UNITA generals and\npoliticians were in the capital of\nLuanda to discuss a runoff, Mr. Dos\nSantos' party distributed arms to its\nmilitants, who massacred thousands\nof Savimbi followers in the capital\nand other government-held cities.\nIt is not clear that Mr. Savimbi\nwould have resumed all-out civil war\nif the pogrom had not taken place\nand he had been offered a meaningful role in the government.\nAs it is, his troops have overrun\ntwo-thirds of the country. An estimated 30,000 more Angolans have\nbeen killed. Spring planting has\nbeen disrupted, and by September\nmillions of innocents may face starvation.\nWashington's goal should be to\nget Messrs. Dos Santos and Savimbi\nto compromise. Recognizing one and\nbranding (he other an outlaw is\nhardly the way.\n�n\nK)NALD AMBRO V\nS\nupporters of enterprise zones\nto bring economic growth\nj and jobs to America's inner\ncities were deeply disappointed by thc anemic, highly regulated version that Bill Clinton sent\nto (longress.\nDuring his presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton praised the enterprise zone idea championed by Jack\nKemp to unleash the power of entrepreneurial capitalism in thc nation's\npoorest communities. But Mr. Clin\nton's bureaucratic and heavily micromanaged version is a far cry from\nMr. Kemp's bold, tax cutting vision\nof dynamic inner-city rebirth.\nIndeed, the White Mouse's statist,\nlop down approach to enterprise\nzones has very little in common with\nthe original idea.\nThc legislation Mr Clinton un\nveiled earlier this month was so bad\nthat Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Connecticut Democrat, a Clinton ally,\nfell compelled to express his disappointment on thc Senate floor.\nThc proposal demonstrated \"a\nfundamental misunderstanding of\nthe enterprise zone concept and the\nreasons why so many of America's\npoorer areas have reached the point\nof decay that they now experience.\"\nsaid the Connecticut Democrat.\nThe Heritage Koundat ion's Stuart\nRut ler, who pioneered tbe enterprise\nzones idea, thinks Mr. Clinton's bill is\n\"worse than nothing\"\nThc administration's proposal i.s\n\"just another dose of Washingtondirected inner city indiislnal policy\n— of Ihe kind that has hastened thc\ndecline of America's cities,\" Mr. Butler said in a blistering memorandum\ncirculated on Capitol Mill.\nAs originally proposed in thc\nearly 1980s by I'resident Kcagan.\nHardly\nthe same\nenterprise\nenterprise zones were intended to be\na radical departure from the decades of misdirected government\nprograms — from \"model cities\" to\n\"urban renewal\" to the War on Poverty.\nSince 1965, the government has\nspent $2.5 trillion on these antipoverty and urban aid programs —\nenough money to buy up all of the\nKortune 500 companies plus every\nacre of American farmland. Yet the\nquality of life in the inner cities has\nworsened and their economies have\nbeen all but snuffed out of existence.\nSad to say, Mr. Clinton's proposal\nshowed that he and his \"new Democrats\" had learned nothing from the\nmistakes of ihe past. Their bill is\nhardly the epitome of \"reinventing\ngovernment.\"\nEnterprise zones are based on the\nidea thai even in the most depressed\ncommunities there is a spirit of entrepreneurship that will grow and\nflourish if tax and regulatory obstaclesarc eliminated to open up access\nlo the marketplace.\nMigh taxes, licensing fees and a\nwall of federal, state and local regulation has raised the \"entry costs\"\nlo beginning a legitimate business.\nKntcrprise zones would do away\nwith these obstacles to encourage\nentrepreneurs and investors to start\nsmall businesses in communities\nwhere joblessness and poverty are\nDonald Uimhro. • hict polilical\ncorrcspondvnl of The WasliiniiUin high but so are thc risks.\nAs Heritage's Mr Butler exTinics. i.s ti nationally svndiidied\nplains, enterprise zones arc \"the ancolumnist.\nlllusliation by J J Smilti-Moor«>t-A Times Syndicate\ntithesis of government development\nmicromanagement. Rather than\ntear down and replace buildings, or\npick and choose firms to locate in an\narea, government would remove\ncostly impediments and then allow\nentrepreneurs thc maximum free\ndom to experiment within existing\nfacilities.\"\nThat was thc promising concept\nthat Messrs Butler. Kemp and Reagan pushed in the 1980s but which\nDemocratic leaders blocked in Congress. In its absence, dozens of\nstates enacted local enterprise\nzones, but they lacked the jurisdic-\ntiontocut taxes on capital — the key\ninvestment incentive.\nMr. Clinton's plan, however, goes\noff in another direction.\nApproaching it as just another\nsmall, pilot program, he would create a mere 10 \"empowerment zones,\"\nonly six of which would be in urban\nareas. He would also set up 100 \"enterprise communities,\" but they\nwould be given very meager incentives, with the emphasis on more\ngovernment spending;\nWorse, he would create a federal\n\"Enterprise Board\" to microtrianage\nthe zones from Washington, l b win\napproval as a zone, states and localities would have to provide the board\nwith a highly detailed \"coordinated\neconomic, human, community and\nphysical development plan.\"\nThus, administration bureaucrats would be empowered to \"force\ntheir views on local communities —\nthe very top-down bureaucratic\nplanning the enterprise zone idea\nwas meant to end,\" says Mr. Butler.\nAlso, zone incentives, largely\naimed at labor costs, are directed at\nlarger firms with heavy tax liabilities — of little help to small, startup\ncompanies. And the plan's expensing and accelerated depreciation\nincentives are only useful to profitable businesses, while new enterprises generally earn little or no\nprofit in the first few years.\nCapital gains tax relief is one of\nthe crucial missing ingredients\nneeded to spur zone investment. \" I\ncannot adequately stress the importance of capital incentives\"forsmall\nbusinesses, Mr. Lieberman lectured\nthe White House.\nThe whole idea behind enterprise\nzones was to tear down the obstacles,\nget away from central planning and\nopen up the market place to entrepreneurs with a dream and ambition. Mr. Clinton's plan, despite all of\nhis soaring rhetoric, shows that he is\nstill deeply wedded to the old way of\ndoing things.\n*\ni\n�Sen. Bore i and Presic ent C inton\nI\nf President Clinton is going to whup the upstart\nDemocrats taunting him from Capitol Hill, he is\ngoing to have to leam, finally, the difference between a tax increase and a tax cut. His energy\ntax under fire from a coalition of moderate Democrats\nand Republicans led by Oklahoma Sen. David Boren,\nMr. Clinton is going for the throat. But his first lunge\nmissed entirely. Mr. Boren, said Mr. Clinton over the\nweekend, is just in the pocket of his state's powerful oil\nlobby. That is an absurdly exaggerated claim, but it has\na nut of truth to it — Mr. Boren does have the interests\nof his constituents (which include many working-class\noil men as well as the vilified oil industrialists) at heart.\nBut once Mr. Clinton is in attack mode, he doesn't stop\nwith mere exaggeration. He went much further,\nclaiming that Mr. Boren is out to get special tax cuts\nfor special interests.\n\" It's simply wrong for a powerful interest to try and\nopt out of this program by asking the elderly and the\nworking poor to contribute more so they can contribute\nless,\" Mr. Clinton opined in his Saturday radio broadcast. Then he went for broke: \"Some of my opponents\nwant to cut Social Security and tax credits to working\nfamilies with incomes of under $30,000 just to get a tax\ncut for the rich. The big oil lobby is trying to wiggle\nout of its contribution to deficit reduction and force\nsenior citizens barely above the poverty line to get\nlower Social Security benefits.\"\nWhoa there, Mr. President. Mr. Clinton's package\nhas not yet even gone to the House, let alone become\nlaw. His proposals, therefore, still count as future tax\nincreases, lb stand in the way of a future tax increase\n— as Mr. Boren is doing — is not the same as asking\nfor a \"tax cut for the rich.\" And tio put a cap on entitlement cost-of-living increases does not count as giving\nseniors \"lower Social Security benefits.\" If Mr. Clinton\nwants to know what will actually diminish the money\nSocial Security recipients get, he might want to look at\nhis proposal to tax 80 percent rather than 50 percent\nof their benefits.\nThese kinds of cheap shots may have worked for\npopulist candidate Clinton against bumbling patrician\ncandidate George Bush. But Mr. Clinton is fooling himself if he thinks that he can tar Mr. Boren with the\ndreaded tax-cuts-for-the-rich brush. Mr. Clinton,\nwhether he likes it or not, needs Mr. Boren's vote if an\nenergy tax is to get past the Senate Energy and Natural\nResources Committee. Attacking Mr. Boren in this\nfashion is not going to win his vote. Mr. Boren's constituents (just like the voters who applauded the Republicans who filibustered the president's pork package) are cheering his defiance of Mr. Clinton. More\nsniping from the White House may just help Mr.\nBoren. Oh, and not incidentally, it might make him\nangry.\nA standard trip to Capitol Hill to twist Mr Boren's\narm won't be good enough if Mr. Clinton has made a\nfull-fledged enemy of him. One would expect the White\nHouse, eventually coming to terms with the fact that\nthe campaign is over and that its adversaries on the\nHill demand respect, to come courting laden with tribute for the rebellious Senate Democrats — some kind\nof exemptions from the energy tax for Mr. Boren's\nconstituents, as well as for those of Sen. J. Bennett\nJohnson. Then the stampede will start, as farm state\nsenators start lining up for their exemptions. Soon\neveryone will want an \"exemption\" and the energy tax\nwill become one of those Swiss cheese provisions that\nkeep loophole-hungry lobbyists fat and happy.\nThat will be the worst of all possible outcomes —\nan energy tax that spares those with big lobbying\nbudgets and crushes small businesses and consumers\nwho don't have K Street representatives. Mr. Clinton,\nfor all his bluster, is headed toward that outcome. We\ncan hope that Mr. Boren, who is in a position to prevent\nit, will do so — that he is serious enough in his complaints not to be bought off with a few trinkets for his\nhome state.\nMr. Clinton hails Angola\nI\nt became fairly apparent in the course of Warren\nChristopher's Senate confirmation hearings that\nU.S. recognition of the Angolan government was\nin the cards. In answer to a question from Sen.\nJesse Helms, Mr. Christopher said, \"We should give\nserious consideration to our earlier commitment to\nrecognize the Angolan government now that they have\nheld free and fair elections.\" The administration apparently has now given the requisite consideration to the\nmatter — and to the arguments of the Congressional\nBlack Caucus as well as the US. oil industry which has\na large stake in resource-rich Angola. And so, official\nU.S. recognition was extended on May 19tothe (formerly) Marxist government of President Jose Eduardo\ndos Santos.\nThe U.S. decision comes in the middle of peace\nnegotiations between Mr. dos Santos and his opponent,\nJonas Savimbi, leader of the National UnionforTbtal\nIndependence of Angola (UNITA), whose rejection of\nlast fall's election results spurred the resumption of\nthe country's 16-year civil war. President Clinton stated\nin his announcement that he \"intendstocontinue working closely with the government of Angola and with\nUNITA to achieve a lasting peace settlement and a\nvibrant democracy there.\" He appearstothink that the\npublic embrace of Mr. dos Santos and a denunciation\nof former U.S. ally UNITA will promote that end. But\nit is far from clear that it will have that effect The day\nafter the announcement, government negotiatorstothe\npeace talks taking place in Abijan, Ethiopia, showed a\ndistinct disinclination to approach their tasks in a serious fashion.\nWhat the future will bring now that the United\nStates has taken this step remains to be seen. At the\nvery least, stringent conditions oughttobe tied to the\nactual exchange of ambassadors and U.S. aid for the\ncountry: good faith on the part of the Angolan government to reach a negotiated peace, respect for human\nrights, freedom of the press, demobilization, a halt to\nimports of arms and mercenaries.\nMONDAY, MAY 24, 1993\nAnd the administration needstofind more reliable\nsources for its interpretation of the events that have\nshaken the country since the resumption of its civil\nwar. In his statement on Wednesday, Mr. Clinton placed\nthe blame squarely on UNITA, whose intransigence,\nhe said, stood in complete contrast to the spirit of\ncooperation that has characterized Mr. dos Santo's demeanor. His government has agreed \"to sign that peace\nagreement, has swom in a democratically elected national assembly, and has offered participation by\nUNITA at all levels of government\"\nSomehow, Mr. Clinton managed to overlook the vicious government purge of UNITA supporters in\nLuanda two weeks after the election, which cost the\nlives of at least 1,200 people, including members of the\nUNITA leadership who had traveled fo Luanda for\nnegotiations. That incident has as much to do with\nrestarting the civil war as Mr. Savimbi's claims, which\nhave been substantiated by a number of independent\nobservers, that the government tried to steal the election.\nMr. Clinton also neglected to mention the 2,000 poUtical prisoners in government jails. And the participation at \"all levels of government\" offered UNITA that\nso impressed ME Clinton initially extended solely to\nthe Ministry of Culture. Later, the government generously offered UNITA control of so-far nonexistent\nministries, albeit ones with such fancy names as the\nMinistry of Reconstruction.\nThe fact that UNTIA has been vastly more successful than the government in the military campaign that\nfollowed the election and now controls some 75 percent\nof the countryside, including Angola's resources of\ndiamonds and oil, no doubt has more to do with\nbringing the governmenttothe negotiating table than\nany passion for the institutions of democracy. It's going\nto take a good deal of effort, and some serious guarantees, on the part of the United States and tht United\nNations to convince UNTIA that it will be worth its\nwhile to give up that advantage., .\n�Clinton\n'warming up' to fight\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n•\n^\n^\nU.N. takes up\n'safe havens'\nBy Lee Michael Katz A l\nUSA TODAY\n/M\nThe U.N.

Thus repeal of the\nHyde Amendment would make tens\nof millions of Americans pay. with\ntheir tax dollars, for a practice which\nthey regard as morally offensive,\nconslitulionnlly unwarmntrd and legally dubious.\nOpponents of the Hyde Amendment say it is \"unfair\" to deny federally funded abortion to the poor. Is\nthat the best we can say to poor women caught in the dilemma of unwanted or unplanned pregnancy: that\nwe'll pay to abort your unborn child?\nMoreover — and this is the question that rarely gets asked in these\ndebates — what about that unborn\nchild? Do we have no obligations to\nthat child? Does that child have no\nclaims upon us?\nMuch of the leadership of the federal government was tied up in knots\nrecently over the fate of the Northwest spotted owl. Are unborn children of less consequence than those\nowls?\nThe Supreme Court has forbidden\nus from protecting the unborn children of the well-to-do. The Hyde\nAmendment at least offers some protection to the unborn children of the\npoor.\nThere is no unjust discrimination\nhere. Federal funding doesn't dover\nall sorts of elective medical procedures. And abortion is very much an\nelective procedure. For virtually no\none has to have an abortion in America today. Across the country, there\nare thousands of voluntary organizations eager and willing to provide\nmedical and financial help to women\nin distress.\nIsn't that voluntary network a better expression of the decency and\ncompassion of the American people\nthan federally funded abortions of\nconvenience?\nTo repeal the Hyde Amendment\nwould reduce abortion to the moral\nstalus of a tonsillectomy. It would\nsubsidize the transient pleasures of\npredatory or irresponsible men. It\nwould give the wildly profitable and\nunregulated abortion industry\n(which already grosses $500 million\na year) drawing rights on the U.S.\nTreasury. It would open the door to\nabortion being a mandated benefit\nunder federal health-care reform.\nAnd it would further erode the\ncharacter of our public life, which\nhas already been coarsened and corrupted by legalized abortion on demand.\nO\no\nI—\n<\nLO\ncn\ncn\nCM\n<\nQ\n�Today's debate is about DEFICIT CUTTING and whether\nenergy taxes or cuts in entitlement spending work better.\nDon't dump energy tax\nEntitlement caps and\nOUR VIEW other gimmicks\nwon't cut the deficit; specific cuts\nand tax increases are needed.\nmedical care to the private sector and\nstates, putting the burden on them to\nraise pnees or laxes.\nEven if those ideas made sense,\nthere's a lot of reason for suspicion.

The two\nhouses have different approaches. But at\nthe heart of both are \"entitlement caps.\"\nBoth proposals place the burden for\ndeficit cutting on the poor and elderly,\nwho receive the most entitlements.\nThe House proposal includes an\nacross-the-board cut that would slice\ninto money that goes mostly for necessities — disability, unemployment, food,\nhealth care — or for retirement.\nThe Senate plan, while showing more\ndiscretion, would shift many costs in • Clinton index, 2A\nCut spending instead\nCapping inOPPOSING VIEW creases In\nentitlement spending Is needed to\ncut deficit down to size.\nTrue to our national spirit Americans\nhave made it clear they are willing to\nshare the sacrifice of deficitreductionas\nlong as there is a guarantee of fairness and\nhonesty.

As recently as last Wednesday, the President\nhad assured House Democrats that he would be\nunyielding with the Senate on the BTU lax. An\nembarrassing reversal could further erode lawmakers'\nconfidence in his leadership, which was shaken by last\nmonth's defeat of his $16.3-billion economic stimulus\npackage.\nAs he left a church service Sunday, Clinton said he\nwas \"just warming up\" for the upcoming battle.\n\"Il's been so long since anybody here has been in a\nfight worth making lhal they get timid.\" he added.\nYei Boren and Breaux each have enormous leverage\nby virtue of their seats on Moynihan's tax-writing\nFinance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the\nbig-money elements of Clinton's economic program.\nA defection by either could doom the President's\nentire economic plan on a panel where Democrats hold\nonly a 11-9 majority.\nClinlon had attacked Boren indirectly in a speech on\nSaturday, when he suggested that his opponents were\ntools of \"the big oil lobby.\"\n\" I wish the President wouldn't have gone on about\nbig oil this weekend, because big oil gets its money in\nthe lax code. . . . This particular BTU enterprise,\nenergy enterprise, is of no concern to them,\" Moynihan said.\nAt the same time, however, Moynihan expressed\nconfidence that Boren could ultimately be persuaded\nto support the\"plan. Boren said Sunday that he sees\nMoynihan's optimism as a sign \"that the White House\nand others are ready to sit down with us and work on\nmaking this package more reasonable, because that, of\ncourse, is what I am seeking, and that's what it would\ntake to get my vote.\"\nMoynihan also noted that Boren had promised\nClinton that his would not be the vole that would stop\nthe President's economic plan.\nDan Webber, Boren's spokesman, conceded that the\nsenator had made such a pledge, but added \"This\nshould not be interpreted to be a blank check for just\nany plan, especially one that increases taxes more\nthan it cuts spending.\"\nThe Oklahoma senator repeated his assertion lhal\nhe will vote against any economic package thai\nincludes the BTU tax.\nOn ABC-TV's \"This Week Wilh David Brinkley,\"\nhe again noted that the tax would fall on virtually\nevery industry, making it harder for U.S. goods to\ncompete with those of foreign manufacturers. Opponents have also complained that lhe tax is unfair\nbecause Clinton has agreed to breaks for some\nindustries, such as aluminum makers, and has excluded certain fuels, such as home heating oil. which is\nused heavily in the Northeast but not in the\nSouth west\nHowever, the AdminisiraUon argues that the tax is\nnot only fair but would help lhe environment as well\nOfficials say it would provide an incentive for\nSen.

BRODER\nTIMES STAFF WRITERS\nW\nASHINGTON-President Clinton seemed to enter office with\nall the makings of a blissful\nmarriage with Congress: healthy Democratic majorities in both houses, a Cabinet\nand senior staff of respected Capitol Hill\nveterans and. perhaps most importantly,\nenormous public yearning for action.\nThat was four months ago. Now. if\nClinton and Congress were husband and\nwife, they'd be headed for the counselor's\noffice.\nCan this marriage be saved\nThe President's biggest challenge now is\nto restore confidence on Capitol Hill-both\nin the fundamentals of his program and in\nhis own ability to muscle it through.\nOn both counts. Democrats in Congress\nwere badly shaken by the legislative fiasco\nover what is now widely regarded as an\nill-conceived plan to help revive the\neconomy with a $16.3-billion spending bill.\nNow he is asking them to Uke even\nbigger gambles, risking their political futures on his belief that such unpopular\nmeasures as higher taxes and sharp spending cuts will restore the nation's economy.\nIf Clinton succeeds in restoring Congress' faith in him. the stumbles of the past\nfew weeks will be written off to experience. If he fails, he could find it impossible\nto muster the voles he will need to carry\nout the remainder of his ambitious program, including his sweeping plan to\nrevolutionize the nation's health care system.\nWhelher Clinton can regain his footing\nis likely to become clear over the next few\nweeks as the President struggles to save\nhis economic blueprint from attacks by his\nown parly in Congress.\nIn the latest challenge. Sen. David L.\nBoren (D-Okla.), ihe author of a competing economic proposal, has publicly\nthreatened to use his critical vote on the\nSenate Finance Committee to sink Clinton's energy tax, which would be based on\nBTU values of various forms of energy.\nAnd that's just the beginning. \"It's clear\n1\nto me that his BTU tax is in big. big\ntrouble, campaign finance reform is probably also in big trouble, and some of his\nnominations could be in trouble. Everybody's for health care reform, but no one\ncan agree on whose health care plan they\nare for.\" said Sen. J. James Exon IDNeb.). \"More and more of the senators I\ntalk to are expressing reservations about\nthe President's programs.\"\nWith Senate passage of the economic\nprogram in jeopardy, House members—\nwhose support had been considered a\nvirtual ceruinty—are suddenly having\nsecond thoughts about going on record in\nfavor of controversial measures that ultimately may be doomed anyway.\nThat, after all. was precisely what they\ndid on the economic stimulus bill, only to\nsee it go down in flames during an\nunanticipated Republican filibuster in the\nSenate.\nFor many members of Congress, \"it's\nextremely difficult lo support a BTU tax in\nthe first place. To do so when they know it\nis dead in the Senate is impossible,\" said\nRep. Jim Slattery (D-Kan.).\nSome have argued that Clinton must get\ntougher and force the recalcitrant Senate\ninto line. Others have insisted with equal\nforce that Clinton's problem is in failing to\nadequately consult, coddle and stroke key\nlawmakers.\n\"We're paying attention.\" said chief\nWhite House lobbyist Howard Paster.\n\"But we have a fascinating dilemma. If we\nfail to respond to their concerns, we are\naccused of being intransigent and politically naive. If we respond, we are accused\nof compromising too quickly and dealing\ntoo fast.\"\nYet there is one thing on which all sides\nagree: Nothing will work unless Congress\nis convinced that voters will support\nClinton and his program. \"There's only one\nsalesman in an Administration. That's the\nPresident of the United States. He has to\nsell and he has to stay focused,\" said Tony\nCoelho. a former California congressman\nand member Of the House Democratic\nleadership.\nClinton and his top advisers constantly\nremind Democratic lawmakers that he and\nthey will ultimately be judged as one and\nthat what they are facing is a.test of\nwhether their party can govern.\nBut not everyone on Capitol Hill sees it\nquite that way. \"There are a lot of people\nhere who hope to be members of Congress\nwhen Bill Clinton is in retirement.\" said\nRep. Bob Carr (D Mich.). who has served\nunder five presidents. \"There's this notion\nthat somehow or another we're all in this\nboat together . . . but we owe our respon:\nsibility to the people who elected us.\n\"This is not Little Rock, and we are not\nthe Arkansas Legislature.\" he added.\nThough the former Arkansas governor\ncampaigned as a Washington outsider,\nmost believed he would not fall victim to\nthe traps that doomed the relationship\nbetween Congress and Jimmy Carter, the\nlast Southern Democratic governor who\nPleat* tee CLINTON, A12\nLOS ANGELES TIMES, WASHINGTON EDITION\nMONDAY, MAY 24. 1993\n�/\ny\nCLINTON\nFeud With\nCongress\nContinued from A4\nswept into town on a mandate for\nchange.\nFor starters.

But sore points\nremain as party activists seek fresh approaches.\nBy ROBERT SHOGAN\nTIMES POLITICAL WRITER\nW\nASHINGTON-Suddenly there is new\nlife in the Grand Old Party. Six months\nafter the Democrats kicked the stuffing\nout of them and took away the White House,\nRepublicans at every level are caught up in a burst\nof brainstorming. They are thrashing out disagreements over abortion and other old sore points and\nstriving to draft fresh approaches to the conundrums of a new political age.\nIn pan these efforts are being driven by\nPresident Clinton's fitful sun in the White House\nand what Republicans contend is his tilt toward his\nparty's traditional liberalism, despite his protestations that he is a \"new kind of Democrat.\" His\nperformance has given them hope that their lime\nwandering in the polilical wilderness may noi lasl\nas long as many had feared.\n\"Bill Clinton is a godsend.\" argued national party\nchairman Haley Barbour. \"I'm not being facetious\nwhen I say that he has done more to unify us than\nanything I have done.\"\nTo exploit this opportunily, Barbour is putting\nthe finishing touches on an ambitious effon to\ncreate a national message for the party by bringing\ntogether local and national leaders at grass-roots\nissues conferences around the country.\n\" I want the average Republican in every sute to\nhave lhe opportunity to share ideas with Republican leaders about how we can better articulate\nwhat we believe in,\" he said.\nA\nI\nlready there are some signs pointing to a\npossible GOP comeback. In Texas, Republican\nsute Treasurer Kay Bailey Hutchison is favored to\nunseat incumbent Democratic Sen. Robert Krueger in a special election nexl month.\nRecent polls also give the GOP an even-money\nchance of uking control of the nation's two largest\ncities, bolh longtime Democratic strongholds—Los\nAngeles, where Republican businessman Richard\nRiordan is pitted against Democratic Councilman\nMichael Woo next month, and New York, where\n1989 GOP mayoral candidate Rudolph W. Giuliani\nis challenging Democratic Mayor David N. Dinkins\nin November.\nWhatever the outcome of these off-year contests. Republicans acknowledge the need to address fundamenul changes in the political landscape. And arriving at some kind of consensus will\nbe no simple Usk. Divisions over some of the\nparty's mosi basic positions—such as abortionremain profound.\nFor more than two decades the GOP dominated\nthe national agenda by persuading voters ihey\nwere better than the Democrats at promoting\ngrowth at home and combatting communism\nabroad. But all that had ended by the 1992 election\nwilh the collapse of the \"Red menace\" and the\nsouring of the economy.\n\"We are now post-Reagan-Bush.\" said William\nJ. Bennett, a 1996 presidential prospect who was\ndrug czar tn the George Bush Administration and\neducation secreury in the Ronald Reagan Administration. \"That era is over and a new era has\nbegun, and we don't yet know what it means.\"\nAs a result, Benneii said. \"What we're gelling is\na political version of the Council of Trent.\"\nreferring to the historic 16th-Century conclave\nthat reformed the Roman Catholic Church. \"It's a\nvery doctnnal debate and it's very vigorous.\"\nNot to be left out, Bennett, along with three\nother conservative GOP sulwarts—former U.N.\nAmbassador Jeane J. Kirkpamck. former Housing\nand Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp and\nformer Minnesou Rep. Vin Weber—founded an\norganization called Empower America to generate\ngrass-roots support for conservative causes.\nRight now, the Washington-based advocacy\ngroup, which holds its first regional conference in\nMilwaukee next month, is using the mails to rally\nits 150.000 members-around the country in opposition to Clinton's lax proposals.\nA\nlthough the new Republican blueprint will not\nbe finally written until 1996, when the party\nnominates its prcsideniial sundard-bearer and\ndrafts a new platform, the broad outlines of the\nGOP's principal new objectives are already emerging. A quick survey of those objectives:\n• Redefine the so-called values issues lo make\nthem more relevant and less divisive.\n\"Don't reject social conservatism, but don't\npackage it like the Salem Witch Trials.\" said media\nstrategist Michael Murphy.\nMany Republicans feel that President Bush's\nerror in the 1992 campaign was not in promoting\ntraditional family values bul in failing lo articulate\nmuch of anything else.\nThe economy and related concerns must be at\nthe core of any political message. \"The trouble\nwith the 1992 convention was that it allowed the\nperipheral part of the message, on values, to\ndominate.\" said Dave Keene, chairman of the\nAmerican Conservative Union. \"There was nothing wrong with the notes struck, except that there\nwas nothing else there.\"\nO\nne solution to the 1992 problem now being\nadvanced is to combine economic issues with\nvalues. \"My view is that it's not just 'the economy,\nstupid,'\" said conservative spokesman Paul M.\nWeyrich, referring to the celebrated slogan of the\nClinton presidential campaign. \"It's also the culture.\"\nWeyrich's answer, offered to about 300 activists\nwho assembled this month in Louisville. Ky..\nunder the aegis of an organization called the\nExchange Foundation: \"Economic issues ought to\nbe discussed. in a cultural c'oniexi.\" The key\nquestion that should be asked about an economic\nproposal. Weyrich said, is: \"How does it affect\nfamilies—not. am I going to get richer?\"\n• Tun« in lo voters' concerns.\n\"There is a new agenda of quality of life issues\nlike health care, education, the environment and\npersonal safety,\" said pollster Bill Mclnturff, who\nis measuring voter attitudes on health care for the\nRepublican National Committee. \"And on these\nissues, except for personal safety, the Republican\nParty is noi even on the map.\n\"We need to come up with ideas about how to\nmake those things better in people's lives.\"\n\"The Amencan people don't see the Republican\nLOS ANGELES TIMES/WASHINGTON EDITION\n1993\n�I)\nParty as having come up with viable alternatives\nto Clinton programs.'' warned Arizona Sen. John\nMcCain at a televised hearing in Washington\nsponsored by a group called the Republican\nMajority Coalition, created this year to build \"a\nbroader and more inclusionary Republican Party.\"\nSimilarly. Republicans discussing health care\nreform at the Louisville conference sponsored by\nthe Exchange Foundation came away agreeing\n\"that what we are going to have to do is not simply\nshoot holes in Hillary Clinton's plan.\" according lo\nMarty Connors, executive director of the foundation. We have to get one ourselves.\"\nOne idea thai stirred interest in Louisville is for a\nnew form of individual retirement account to\nwhich both employers and workers would contribute. The combined annual contribuiions of up lo\n$2,500 would go to cover costs of heallh insurance:\nanyihing left at year's end could be rolled over for\npersonal use.\n• Get back to the local level.\nFor a Republican in Democral-run Washington,\n\"the only right vote right now is a no' vote,\" said\nLamar Alexander. Bush's former education secretary. \"If we are going to win back the country, we\nare going to have to do it neighborhood by\nneighborhood.\"\nAlexander lold the Louisville meeting of the\nExchange Foundation that localities often provide\nideal laboratories for testing the Republican concept of privatizing government, particularly in\neducation.\nAs examples, he cited Baltimore, where nine\npublic schools teamed up to hire an ouiside\ncustodial service to cut maintenance cosls, and\nMurfreesboro, Tenn.. where parents got logether\nto arrange a child-care program in classrooms\nafter regular school hours.\n\"People are increasingly aware that they can't\nlook to Washington for solutions like these.\" said\nAlexander, who, like Bennett, is considering a run\nfor the 1996 GOP presidential nomination.\nW\nelfare is another area ripe for local and slate\nreform. Republicans believe. Pollster Mclnturff points to a plan hatched by Ohio Republicans\nto give single mothers receiving benefits through\nthe Aid to Families with Dependent Children\nprogram $64 a month more if they finish high\nschool.\nTo a large degree, \"the missing link between\nwhere we were in 1992 and where we want to be\npositioned in 1996 has got to be provided by\nRepublican mayors and governors who are doing\nthings.\" said Mclnturff. \"So when our nominee\nruns in 19% he or she can say. What I want to do\nnationally is what Gov. (George V.] Voinovich is\ndoing in Ohio.'\"\nBut for all the efforts going forward, no one\npretends that hammering out a new GOP vision\nwill be easy. There are too many intraparty nfts.\nOn foreign policy, before the end of the Cold\nWar. Republicans were almost monohlhic in their\nwillingness to act to curb the threat of communism.\nBut now the party is more divided over what the\nU.S. role should be abroad, a division pointed up by\nthe debate over whether to intervene in Bosnia.\n\" I think Bosnia is very tough.\" said Bennett, who\nexpresses a reluctance about U.S. intervention.\n\"I'm impressed by the moral arguments, but I'm\nstill looking for the national interest.\"\nAnother division is over the role of government.\nMany Republicans maintain the traditional view of\ngovernment as an adversary. But Kemp, another\n1996 White House prospect, argues for a government that is bolh \"downsized\" and yei activist as a\ncatalyst in helping achieve such objectives as\nenterprise zones and tenant ownership of public\nhousine.\nThe saying that government is best which\ngoverns least \"is true as far as it goes.\" Kemp said.\n\"But I would add a comma and say. That\ngovernment is best which does the most to create a\nclimate of opponunny.\"\"\nBut by far the sharpest division and the hardest\none to heal is the nfi over so-called social issues,\nparticularly over a woman's right to abortion.\nThose on each side of the issue argue on both moral\nand political grounds.\nContending that the party would have a hard\ntime winning a presidential election if it abandoned\nits opposition to abortion. Patrick J. Buchanan,\nwhose challenge to Bush's renomination established him as a force to be reckoned with, said at\nthe Republican Majority Coalition hearing: \"If we\nwalk away from that, they [the voters) will say\nthese people (Republicans! don't really believe in\nanything.\"\nBut at the same hearing. Maryland Rep. Constance A. Morella linked the party platform's\nunyielding opposition to abortion with Bush's 1992\ndefeat. \"Had the Republican Party platform reflected the views of rank-and-file mainslream\nRepublicans and not the extreme, extreme right,\nthe party would have retained the loyalty of\nRepublicans who are traditional conservatives,\nliberals and libertarians.\" she said.\nMoreover, the opposing positions on abortion are\nat the core of a vast divergence in altitudes on\ncultural and value issues in general.\nT\nhus, welcoming participants to the first conference of the American Cause, the educational\nfoundation he recently set up, Buchanan reiterated\nthe declaration of cultural war he proclaimed at\nthe 1992 GOP convention and added: \"We traditionalists and conservatives have only just begun\nto fight.\"\nFor her part. Morella said of the platform that\nconvention adopted: \"It sent a message that was\nloud, clear, mean and intolerant across this country. If you don't talk a certain way, raise your kids\na certain way. love a certain way and pray a\ncertain way, you are most certainly not welcome\nhere.\"\nDespite the impassioned tone of the rhetoric on\nboth sides, many feel that ainng such differences is\nthe only way they can be resolved.\n\" I think there is going to be a long-term debate\"\non the abortion issue, said Pennsylvania Sen.

Of course, there will be informal chats with company officials too.\n\"This is not lobbying,\" insisted Ken\nBowler, one of two Pfizer lobbyists\norganizing the event. \"My spin on this is\nthat it is very informative. People can see\nwhat we are doing. There's time to\nactually talk to scientists.\"\nEven ihough it is indeed deemed\neducational and violates no ethics rules,\nthe junket could not come at a more\nopportune moment for the company.\nAs an internal memo from an industry\ncoalition noted. President Clinton has\nidentified pharmaceutical manufacturers\nas \"public enemy No. 1\" in his fight fof\nhealth care reform. Some form of restraint on drug prices may be part of\nClinton's plan.\nPrice controls, like the rest of Clinton's\npackage, will require congressional approval. As a result, congressional staff\nmembers are expected to play an imporunt role in influencing their bosses on\nthe complex legislation.\nEven in a city where lobbying is\npervasive, the battle over health care\nreform is shaping up as the most bruising\nand expensive contest in history. As the\nAdministration's plan moves toward\ncompletion, interest groups of all types\nare moving into the fray, and the price\nUg is expected to top J100 million.\nIn the end. the outcome will determine\nwhether the President can transform one\nof his major campaign promises into\nreality when pitted against Washington's\nentrenched army of lobbyists.\n\" I don't know what has come along\nthat touches such a big piece of the\neconomy and so directly affects so many\nindividuals,\" said Jody Powell, the former Jimmy Carter Administration press\nsecreury whose Washington firm is\nrunning a $2-million public relations\ncampaign for six large pharmaceutical\ncompanies.\nDrug companies already are mobilizing\nto fight price controls. Other potential\nlosers, such as health insurance companies and insurance agents, are also developing strategies to counter proposals that\ncould cost them business and jobs.\nWith opinion polls showing heavy\npublic support for reform, lobbyists are\nsensitive to the risks they may run in\nchallenging Clinton on the issue.\nNone Ulk publicly about derailing\nheallh care reform. So far, they prefer to\ndiscuss ways they can work with the\nAdministration in hopes of crafting modifications to the anticipated proposal. Yet\nprivately, some describe strategies for\nblocking the President's plan in Congress.\nFew industries have more at suke in\nthe outcome of this battle than drug\ncompanies, and the massive scale of their\nlobbying effort matches th&sukes.\nSo far, the industry's response has\nbeen divided. Some companies, such as\nMerck & Co.. hope to head off mandatory\nprice controls by promising voluntary\nrestraints. Others oppose any attempt to\ncontrol prices.\nPfizer's upcoming trip for congressional suffers is intended partly to convey\nthe message that drug prices seem high\nonly because they must finance the\nexpensive development of new medicines.\n\"The focus is on the research itself,\"\nsaid Bowler, the Pfizer lobbyist and\nhimself a fonner Democratic suff member of the House Ways and Means\nCommittee.\nConsumer organizations complain that\ndrug prices threaten viul research and\ndevelopment. But the underlying goals\nare to persuade legislators that the public\ninterest is represented by the drug companies, not the Administration, and to\npoke holes in the Clinton plan.\nThe health insurance industry appears\nwilling to make some concessions in\nhopes of avoiding bigger losses. After\nyears of being accused of refusing to\ninsure people with a history of medical\nproblems, the industry now supports\nuniversal, cradle-to-grave coverage with\nno exclusions—one of the Administration's concepts.\nCentral to the Clinton plan is likely to\nbe a series of government-mandated\nhealth insurance purchasing cooperatives. The organizations will buy health\ninsurance and manage programs for large\ngroups of employers and individuals.\nMajor insurance companies would\nprobably manage some of the cooperatives, and universal coverage would create new customers who are likely to be\nsnapped up by the big companies. But the\nscenario leaves smaller and mediumsized companies scrambling for business.\nLast month, the insurers opened a\n$4-million ad campaign designed to highlight the risks to personal choices posed\nby some likely aspects of the Clinton\nplan. It is a potent argument with large\nnumbers of Americans afraid of what\nthey might lose in a restructured health\nsystem, according to polls.\n\"Our sense is that the public cares a\ngreat deal not only about a choice of\n'Are you prepared to lose your job?'\nLatter to 12.000 Insurance agents from their Washington trade group\nthey lack the resources to pay for a resort\nweekend to get their message across to\ncongressional suffers.\n\"It's clearly something that those of us\nwho are on the public-interest side can't\ncompete with.\" said Cathy Hurwii, chief\nlobbyist for Citizen Action, a consumer\norganization lhal favors comprehensive\nnational health insurance.\nOverall, the drug industry's lobbying is\ncoordinated by its Washington-based\ntrade group, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn. But insiders say some\ncompanies feel that the PMA has been\ntoo slow to respond.\nG. D. Searle and five other manufacturers have combined efforts in a $2-million\nnational campaign to counter the black\neye given to them by the Administration.\nThey named themselves Rx Partners and\nhired Powell's public relations firm.\nPowell Tate.\nInsights into their strategy are\ncontained in a' paper prepared by Powell\nTate. Rx Partners plans a graas-roota\ncampaign of letters and phone calls to the\nWhite Houae and key members of Congress, as well aa approaches to journalisu\nand local news outlets.\nThe theme will be that controla on\ndoctors or hospitals, but about health\ninsurance.\" said Bill Gradison. a Republican who resigned from Congress last\nyear and became president of ihe industry trade organization, the Health Insurance Assn. of America.\nThe prospect of purchasing cooperatives is even more ominous to the people\nwho sell health insurance for a living and\nwho could effectively be replaced by\nthem.\n\"Are you prepared to low your job?\"\nbegins a letter sent to 12,000 insurance\nagents by their Washington trade group,\nthe National Assn. of Health Underwriters.\nThe letter describes the fight against\nthe Administration as a \"life-or-death\nbattle\" and appeals for S1.2 million in\ncontributions to an emergency \"war\nchest\"\nFor the first time, the organization has\nhired outside lobbyists—the law firm of\nPatton, Boggs A Blow and the former top\naides to Sem. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Uuh)\nand Mitch McConnell (R-KjT).\n\"We're not looking for magic bullets,\"\nsaid E. Neil Tramwein. director of government affairs for the insurance group.\n\"What we are looking for is accurate\n11\n�Care Battle\n.\n7\nintelligence and political advice \"\nThe most effective lobbyists are often\nnot lobbyists at all One of Washington's\nmost feared lobbying powers is the\nIndependent Insurance Agents of America, which relies heavily on the political\nsavvy of its 280.000 members.\nFor years, the organization has fought\noff attempts by banks lo enter ihe\ninsurance business. Part of the reason for\ntheir success is a membership that does\nnot hesitate to make us views known lo\nUs represeniauves in Congress.\nPaul A. Equale. the group's lop lobbyist, can flood the House and Senate with\ntelegrams, phone calls and agems at a\nmoment's notice\nHealth insurance represents aboul\n20% of the independent agents' business.\nIl is also their fastest-growing producl.\nSo the organization was already concerned that ihe purchasing cooperatives\nwould cui deeply inio their livelihood.\nConcern grew into alarm on the weekend of May 8 when Firsi Lady Hillary\nRodham Clinlon, head of the Administration's heallh care lask force, threatened\ntwo other big products. She told a\nbusiness conference thai changes in\nworkers' compensation and the medical\nportion of auio insurance will be folded\ninio ihe reforms.\nEquale was at the White House by the\nfollowing Monday, expressing his anxieties to a senior staff member of Hillary\nClinton's lask force. But his group may\nunleash a more potent weapon, someone\nwith access to a higher level. .\nGeorge Frazier is a past president of\nthe insurance agents' group. He also is\nfrom Hope, Ark., where years ago he\nbefriended a fatherless boy named Bill\nClinlon. The two remain close friends and\nFrazier recently visited the Clintons at\nthe White House. He said health care was\nnot discussed.\n\"We're very close friends.\" said Frazier. \" I l would be a little premature to\nbring up the subject.\"\nClinton knew at least some of what he\nwould face. In announcing the health\ncare task force headed by his wife on Jan.\n25. the President spoke of the \"powerful\nforces\" arrayed against the effort.\nAccording to a presidential adviser, the\nremark was a direct reference to lobbyists—both a recognition of their influence\nand a warning to them not to abuse it. If\nlobbying threatens to derail heallh care\nreform, officials say Clinton will retaliate\nby portraying lobbyists as hired guns\npaid to work against the public interest.\nAlso, surveys show that Americans\nwant the health care system changed and\nare willing to pay higher taxes to do it. A\nrecent poll for the Democratic leadership\nin Congress showed lhal 62% of lhe\nvoters supported the President's iniention.\nThis creates a powerful incentive for\nmembers of Congress to back some\nversion of change, particularly since the\nvote is not likely until 1994—an election\nyear.\nMONDAY.

Secretary of\nDefense Les Aspin last week buried \"Star Wars,\" the missile defense\nsystem announced 10 years ago by\nRonald Reagan. It was a dignified\nceremony.

Star Wars was\noriginally envisioned as space-based\nand designed to counter a massive\nSoviet attack of thousands of missiles.\nBMDO will be ground-based and have\nnew prioriUes: first, shooUng down\nmissiles in a theater of war (like the\nGulf War's Scuds) to protect American troops and allies; second, a\nground-based territorial defense of\nthe United Slates against a limited\nmissile attack, and. only third, research on lhe more exotic (especially\nspace-based) defenses of the future.\nW\nhy was the funeral a fake?\nBecause nothing really happened. Reagan's Star Wars idea of\nshooting down a massive Soviet attack had been discounted years ago.\nBy the late 1980s, even supporters\nbegan to see the major use for SDI as\ndefense against only limited attacks.\nNonetheless, the fake funeral was\nimportant. Aspin knows that the\nUnited Sutes needs missile defense.\nHe also knows that Democrats have\nan allergy to the words itrategie\ndejente and Star Wars, which carry\nthe taint of Ronald Reagan. How to\nmake SDI a Democratic program?\nChange the name. Democrau can now\nconUnuc to ridicule Star Wars while\nstaunchly defending BMDO.\nOld anU-SDl types, like John Pike\nof the Federation of American Scientists and Rep.

And that link\nbears examining. . . . Boren makes a big show of not taking PAC\nmoney for his campaigns, but he still gets plenty of special-interest\ndough in a different form: individual contributions.

When Boren last ran for reelection in\n1990, he raised more than $177,000 from the people of Amoco.\nMobil and such.

Also, a bnsk exchange of goods and services among\ndivisions of multinational companies\nspurs commerce on both sides of the\nAtlantic.\nBY JAMES FLANIGAN\nD\nistani trends spelled bad news\nfor U.S. companies and jobs\nlast week, while a couple of\noverseas events were more hopeful.\nAnd if you undersund why, you may\nbe able to set the Clinton Administration straight about policy or at least\nhave a clue about how a changing\nworld affects you.\nThe trade figures for March were\nbad. a $10.2-billion trade deficit\ncaused particularly by an excess of\nimports from Asia. Japan shipped $5.3\nbillion more in merchandise to the\nUnited Sutes than it bought from U.S.\nsuppliers; the 1993 trade Unbalance\nwith Japan may be even worse Lhan\nlast year's $50-billion deficit\nChina, Hong Kong, South Korea,\nTaiwan and Singapore also ran a trade\nsurplus with the United States—although no other region of the world\ndid.\nIt was nothing to take lightly. Large\ntrade deficits put a damper on U.S.\nproduction, lower economic growth\nand prevent job creation.\nYet the Clinton Administration responded only with brain-dead claims\nthat a lower dollar will correct the\ntrade imbalance, eventually, by making foreign goods dearer and U.S.\nproducts cheaper. But that won't\nhappen. A lower dollar has little effect\non Japan's trade practices, for several\nhistoric reasons. And it has no effect\non places like Hong Kong and Taiwan\nwhich peg their currencies to the\ndollar.\nAll the poUcy does is lower U.S.\nliving standards along with the ability\nof U.S. companies to invest in Asia,\nwhich would be one way to eam\nprofits, create U.S. jobs and address\nthe trade problem.\nSomething more forceful than dollar devaluation will have to be tried—\nand we'll see what that is.\nBut first the good news. The Danes\nvoted Tuesday to support closer economic and political union in Europe,\nreversing a negative vote last year.\nAnd the British House of Commons\nsupported European union by a 2-to-l\nvote on Thursday.\nThe votes mean that Europe, a good\ncustomer for American goods in more\nways than one. might start recovering\nfrom its deep recession. \"It may not be\na big push, but I think it's a help\ntoward coming out of the crisis,\" says\nAndreas Van Agt, the European Community's ambassador to the United\nSutes.\nThat's encouraging. Western Europe took more than $114 billion\nworth of U.S. exports last year. 26% of\nthe total-and gave the U.S. a $3\nbilhon trade surplus. But this year\nU.S. exports have suffered because\ncountries in recession don't buy goods,\nno matter how cheap a lower dollar\nmakes them.\nMoreover. U.S. companies have\nsubstantial investments in Europe—\nas unfortunately they do not in Asia.\nOf roughly $475 billion in U.S. investment overseas, almost 50% is in\nEurope but only 11% is in Asia,\nincluding Japan.\nSo clearly an expanding Europe\ntomorrow will help us all, but a\nEuropean recession hurts us all today.\nAsia is different. Not only is U.S.\nbusiness investment relatively low,\nbut a U.S. trade deficit with the\nemerging economy of China—$18 billion last year—threatens to duplicate\nthe chronic problem of Japan.\nOne way to find a solution is to\nseparate Japan and the rest of Asia in\nyour thinking, suggests Michael Borrus, an associate of the Berkeley\nRoundtable on Intemational Economics-the research institute where\nLaura Tyson worked before becoming\nchief economic adviser in the Clinlon\nAdministration.\nThe U.S. problem with Japan lies in\npostwar history and the automobile\nindustry. The U.S. opened its market\ntb Japanese exports after World War\nII as a means of encouraging development It was an Asian equivalent of\nthe Marshall Plan that revived Eu\" ' B U I Japan-which has been ruled\nby the same political party all these\nyears-is still bving in that postwar\ntrade cocoon. That's why its automobile industry produces 14 million cars\na year for a home market that buys 7\nmilhon or fewer. The remainder are\nexported and constitute the bulk of\nPlease SM FLANIGAN, BS\nFLANIGAN\nContinued from B4\nthe United Sutes' $40-billion trade\ndeficit in automobiles and parts—\nroughly half the total U.S. trade\ndeficit, petroleum making up the\nother half.\nLowering the dollar against the\nyen—making Japanese cars more\nexpensive in the United Sutes—\nmay persuade Japan's auto makers\nover time to build more cars in U.S.\nplants. But a quicker cure, now\ngaining support in Washington, is\nsimply to tell the Japanese government to cut the trade deficit Japan\ncan buy other products, ship fewer\nautos. whatever—the result should\nbenefit U.S. production.

WILLIAMS\nVIENNA\nA\nrepackaged peace plan heralded in Washington as a fresh\nattempt to halt the bloodshed\nin Bosnia-Herzegovina has papered\nover differences between Washington\nand European allies but is unlikely to\nease the plight of the war-torn republic's vanquished Muslims. \"\nThe measures announced by the\nUnited States, Russia and Western\nEurope amount to a retracing of steps\nalready taken and proposals for containing the conflict that still have high\nhurdles to clear.\nAs Secretary of State Warren\nChristopher was working out the\ndetails of the latest Western initiative\nwith his counterparts from Russia,\nBriuin. France and Spain, the Serbian\nrebels who have already overrun 70%\nof Bosnia were continuing to pound\nthe capital, Sarajevo, with heavy artillery fire. At least 12 were killed, and\na deputy prime minister was among\ndozens injured.\nThus, while the international community delves into the time-consuming work of translating its diplomatic\ntongue-lashing into action, Bosnia's\ndefiant Serbs—emboldened by the\noutside world's reluctance to stop\nthem—may press on with their deadly\ndrive to create an ethnically pure,\nindependent sute.\nThe most forceful action proposed\nby Christopher and his colleagues was\nthe creation of \"safe havens\" in the\nfew parts of Bosnia where Muslims\nstill live and protection of those\nenclaves with U.N. troops and U.S. air\npower.\nWhile the esublishment of such\nrefuges might spare the lives of those\ninside them, deployment of U.N.\npeacekeepers would have the effect of\nfreezing the temtorial sutus quo,\nallowing the Serbian gunmen to keep\nthe land they have seized.\nSome Western diplomats monitoring the Balkan crisis warn that creating safe areas has the unintended side\neffect of doing the Serbs' dirty work\nfor them: To make each area truly\nsafe, U.N. troops would have to disarm those under their protection,\nwhile the rebels surrounding the protected areas would retain their unks\nand guns.\nisarmed or not, safe areas also\ncarry the potential lo become\nbreeding grounds for insurrection.\nBosnia's Slavic Muslims, who were\nthe largest of the republic's three\nethnic groups, account for the vast\nmajority of 150,000 dead or missing\nand 2 million displaced by the reviled\npractice of \"ethnic cleansing.\" They\nare increasingly bitter over the refusal of the world's leading democracies\nto help them and are unlikely to\npeacefully submit to confinement on\nsqualid and destitute reservations.\nAll but one of the cities under\nconsideration for safe area sutus have\nbeen pounded into rubble since the\nSerbs took up arms against a March,\n1992. vote for independence by\nBosnia's majority Muslims and Croats.\nTuzla remains marginally functional\ndue to its considerable industrial resources and little war damage, bul\nSarajevo, Bihac. Gorazde, Zepa and\nSrebrenica have been shattered by\nSerbian artillery, and their holdout\nresidents are idle, often homeless and\nwholly dependent on foreign food aid.\nOther actions proposed by Christopher and the Europeans appear\nfraught with uncertainty because\nthey would require cooperation from\nthe Serbs who are the targets of the\nmeasures.\nA call for ensuring that Belgrade\nshuts down the arms and fuel pipeline\nto its proxy warlords in Bosnia seemed\nto back a Russian suggestion that\nU.N. troops be deployed on Bosnia's\neastern border. But the defiant leaders of what is left of Yugoslavia have\nalready signaled their refusal to allow\nthe sutioning of foreign troops on the\nterritory of Serbia and Montenegro.\nYugoslav President Dobrica Cosic,\nthe nationalist writer considered the\ngodfather of the Greater Serbia\nmovement, was quoted Friday as\nsaying that the presence of foreign\ntroops would \"put in jeopardy our\nsovereignty and our national dignity.\"\nWhen President Clinton earlier this\nmonth was pushing for air strikes\nagainst the Bosnian Serbs and military aid to the beleaguered Muslims,\nSerbian President Slobodan Milosevic\nappeared willing to work with the\nWest lo cut off support for the defiant\nrebels. But because those threats of\nforce have been exposed as empty.\nMilosevic has little to fear if he fails to\nfulfill his promise to cease supplying\nthe Bosnian Serbs.\nSerbia can be expected to be even\nmore defiant in the face of any\nattempts by the intemational community to sution troops in its province of\nKosovo.\nAmong the measures proposed by\nChristopher and the foreign ministers\nto keep the Balkan war from spreading were peacekeeping deployments\nPleas* tec WILLIAMS, A3\nLOS ANGELES TIMES / WASHINGTON EDITION\nMONDAY, MAY 24, 1993\nContinued from A2\nto Kosovo and to the newly recognized republic of Macedonia.\nThe Macedonian leadership in\nSkopje is eager for Weslern protection, as it fears an imminent\nexplosion of violence in neighboring Kosovo province, a part of\nSerbia, that could quickly spread to\nMacedonia and the rest of the\nBalkans.\nTensions between Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majorily and heavily\narmed Serbian security forces are\nat razor sharpness, and a provocation by either side could lead to a\ndeadly confrontation that would\ndraw Albanians from Macedonia\nand Albania to their Kosovo brothers' side.\nBut the nationalists among the\nSerbian and federal leaders in Belgrade are widely expected to balk\nat any foreign troop presence in\nKosovo.\nAlthough Serbs make up less\nthan 10% of the province's 2 million population, they revere it as\nthe heartland of their glorious\nmedieval kingdom and the scene of\ntheir greatest battle, a deadly 1389\ndefeat at the hands of the Ottoman\nTurks.\nDefusing the Kosovo time bomb\nwould also deprive the nationalist\nleadership in Belgrade of a convenient diversion in the event\nSerbs begin fighting each other\nover the need to wage war in\nBosnia or because of the social\nhardships imposed by U.N. sanctions.\nThe rest of the steps supported\nby the diplomats during their Ulks\nin Washington on Saturday\namounted to reiterating their commitment to delivering humanitarian aid to the war's victims, policing\na \"no-fly\" zone in the little-used\nskies over Bosnia, continued efforts at negotiating a settlement\nand setting up a war crimes tribunal.\nWhile the latest attempt to bring\npeace to Bosnia appeared unlikely\nto curb Serbian aggression or improve life for the beleaguered Muslims, it served to heal a diplomatic\nrift that resulted when Clinton\npushed for tough moves against\nthe Serbs that the Europeans were\nunwilling to Uke.\nThe quandary over how to stop\nthe Serbian land grab had driven a\nwedge between Washington and\nEuropean allies fearful of being\npulled down into the deadly Balkan\nouagmire.\n�NAY j t j • 9 3 . 2 2 ' 4 4 SEATTLt..\np.l\n^\nSeattle 05^^l^t9l!:ge^ce^ Vonday, May-24. \"SSS\nPacific Northwest\nlog exports down\nand may stay there\nDecline hasn't solved the mills' supply problem\nrecent court decision, were banned from\nWashington state forests.\nExponeri such as Weyerhaeuser Co.\nLost amid all thc fighting over log say a ban on export sales would cost joba\nexports and : e rale they play in :ha and hurt American forest products comM\nPacific Nerthwsst's timber supply prob- panies' ability to compete internationally,\nbut wouldn't necessarily make more timlerru is this interesting development:\nLag exports are down - sijjnit'icantly. ber available to donesn'c mills.\nThe Clinton administration is likely to\nTrcm a peak of nearly 3.7 billion\nioard feet in 1VS8, lag exports from include log exports in its recommendawashmgion one Oregon have dropped 40 tions.

Ordinarily such\nhigh prices would encourage more production that wcuid helo moderate prices.\nEven ihough many private landowners are filing for permits to cut their\n•.imber, in part because of those high\nprices, that's not boosting export volume\neither, Flynn says. \"It's a whole bunch of\npeople with small volumes getting per•nits,'' he said. Becouse of the age of the\navailable timber, \"We're not able to\nincrease harvest on private lands substantially.\"\nChanging conditions abroad will also\n\"ielp cut consumption of American cxoorrs, F'ynn says. Japan, China, South\nKorea and other Pacific Rim lumber-consuming nations can buy\nlogs from the Russian Far Hast\nand radiata pine from New Zealand and Chile.\nIn addition the Japanese are\nbuying more finished lumber because of a labor shortage affecting\nall industry, including mills,\nFlynn has written.\nThat ought to be good r.ews for\nlog-starved domestic mills. Roben\nCugini, vice president of BarCee\nMill Co. in Ronton, says he's not\nswayed by arguments that threatened mills are geared for oidgrowth, not the smaller secondand third-arowth logs that are\nexported. There are plenty of logs\nheaded overseas he could process\nat his mill, which has had to\ncurtail operations because of supply problems, he says.\n\"I think in the future you may\nfind a shortage of small logs and\nno: large logs,\" Cugini says. \"Everyone has constructed sawmills\nto process small logs.\"\nBut Flynn notes the lagging\nvolumes in spite of higher prices;\nhe also points out that in spite of\nche desperate need for wood,\nharvest volumes on Washington\nDepartment of Natural Resource\nlands fell over the last few years\nby just about the amount of wood\nDNR had sold for export before\nthe ban. \"It's just not being cut,\nfor a variety of reasons,\" such as\nlost sales because of uncertainty\nover environmental restrictions,\nFlynn says.\nThat raises the queatlon of\nwhether declining export volumes\nreally mean more wood for domestic mills.\n�»5b*\nj , M REGISTER N t ^ u o w ; 5-23-ao ; 11:03ftt :;^ D. h. . ^\n.\nUephdrdt\nforesees\neasing tax\non farms\nWhite Houee N w 8unwary\nee\n\"Wt'n $t t eroMrotdt,\" h uid.\ne\ni \"Thera'inoifouif tdbeg lotof ah\nt>\n•rchMicaetoatnlghten thla dcfldt\nThi Mc Ct Democrat\nfM r\nThit la it This U whit w« CV\nalso says It is time to make outtnd what we were elected toTW\nfor\ndo.\nA d if all of ua get thrown o t ben\nu\npalnfjldeeUionitoflntUy\ncause w did it, we've g t to d it,\ne\no\no\nrein in the deficit\nb c u e It'a theri|htthb^tod for\nea a\no\nthlioountry.Qephardt u e Na appearance to\nad\ndefend CUnton's program, which ia\neominf under intenae crttldain\nne h o o\nUA.

A ! offer- exactly the same\ncoverage, which is mandated by federal law. But\ncosts vary from about 8 pereent of a worker's annual\nwage to 15 pe» cent. Trie amount is evenly split\nbetween the worker- and the employer-.\nThe government pays the insuj-ance premiums\nfor- those -who are unemployed or on welfare.\nSuch univer-sal cover age, what the Germans call\n'•solidarity,\" is a key goal of the Clinton task force It\nnot only reduces inequality, Germans argue, but\nmakes for- a more efficient system. German\ninsurance companies take in both high-risk and lewnsk patients, spreading costs around. An American\nhospital in an inner-city neighborhood, by contrast,\nwill have to pass or. the costs of treating pool- people\nwith no health insurance to its better-off patients,\ndriving their insurance costs up.\nMedical costs in Ger many are set through an\nelaborate network of agreements negotiated among\ngroups of doctors, hospitals and insurance\ncompanies.\nFor example, Genrany's biggest health '\ninsurance company, AOK. represents about half of\nall Gci-man workers. This year it budgeted 15\npercent of its revenues for doctors bills, and then\nnegotiated with various doctor- groups to set fees\naccordingly.\nThe doctors go along because unless they become\nmembei s of the insurance system, they cannot earn\nmuch money. Only 10 percent of Gei-mans have\nprivate health insurance.\n\"The idea is to create a large community that\nthen forms contracts with the other parls of the\nsystem/' said Friedrich Abraham, a spokesman for\nAOK. \"Then you make the whole system so\nappealing that everyone wants to be a pan of it\"\nThe Clinton health care task foite is considering\na similar stracture - a eating large groups of insured\npeople who will then be able to negotiate cheaperprices with hospitals and doctor-s, much as health\nmaintenance organizations do.\nDdctoi-s in Gei-many earn about $100,000 a year\nversus the Sl 50,000 that a typical doctor earns in the\n1\n1\nI:\n�H V 2 - 3 MN 1 3 BSO GOE\nA - 4 9 O' : 8 OTN LB\nited Stat/.s.

What\ndoes work, he freely admits, is\nClinton's taking him seriously as\nthe presidenl develops his healthcare proposal.\nTribune eorrespondem Mitchefl\nLocin contributed to this rrport.\n8\nD\no\n(3\nO\nOJ\n�MAY 24 ' 9 3\nZZ'-SSfW 00663000001\nP.2\nA window for senous deficit talks\nWithin hours after he squashed an upriiing of\nHouse Democrats unhappy with his economic plan,\nPresident Clinton circled the White House wagons to\ndefend himself against an upstart gang of senaton.\nLed by Oklahoma Democrat David Boren and Missouri Republican John Danforth, the small group of\nmoderates offered an alternative program centered on\nthe idea of substituting deeper spending cuts for the\npresident's proposed energy tax.\n.The Senaterebelsweren't out to embarrass the president Their proposal, Boren said, was \"a constructive\nsuggestion that will hopeftilly begin a bipartisan dialoguetofindarealsolution to the deficit problem.\"\nUnfortunateh, Clinton'sfirstreactionwas thai he\nwould have none of it. Like a besiegedfieldcommander, he quickly dispatched his lieutenants to hdp hirr\nridicule and denounce the senators' alternative.\nOne hopes that, afterreflection,the president will\nreconsider. For by talcing such an uncompromising\nposition, he invites arepemionof the defeat on his\nstimulus package and threatens the prospects for senous deficit\nreduction.\n,\nThe House is scheduled to vote on Ointon's budget\nat midweek. Many of its members also oppose the\nenergy tax and want itreplacedwith spending cuts,\nbut the Icadenhip, with the president's blessing, has\ndosed debate on the issue. Still/ some Democrats may\nvote against Clinton's tax plan if they think it could be\ndefeated or weakened significantly in the Senate.\nThus, tbe president has a few days in which to exert\nJ\nleadership on deficit reduction. Instead of using gimmicks like hisrecentlyproposed deficit trust fund, he\ncan demonstrate his resolve by listening to alternatives\nand seeking improvements in his plan.\nHe need not surrender to any ideological faction\nwithin his party or the opposition's, but he should be\nwilling to practice a politics of inclusion, not exclusion, while focusing intently on deficit reduction.\nDeficit reductionrequiresraising taxes, slashing\nspending or both. Liberals prefer raising taxes; conservatives favor cutting spending. The fairest way to\nspread the pain is with some combination of both.\nClinton's plan would cut deficits by $496 billion\nover five yean throughrecordtax increases of $272\nbillion (including $72 billion from the energy tax) and\nthe balance through spending cuts and lower interest\npayments on the national debt Crucially, most of thc\nClinton tax increases come in the early years, while\nthe spending cuts come later.\nBoren's plan would slice $542 billion off the deficits\nby reducing spending more than $330 billion and\nraising taxes $150 billion, more than $2 of spending\ncuts for every $1 of new taxes. Most of the increased\nsavings in spending would come from limiting growth\nof federal benefit programs, except Social Security.\nCynical voters don't believe anyone in Washington is\nserious about deficitreduction.Tbey aren't looking for\nbalanced budgets, just a sign offiscalresponsibility.\nThe maverick senators have given Clinton an opportunity to give that sign. He ought to grab it.\nA travel-office tale that doesn't fly\nClinton administration officials tried to portray the\nfiring of the seven-member White House travel staff\nlast Wednesday as a corrective action taken to further\ngood government andfinancialaccountability.\nThey said it was necessary because an audit showed\nmismanagement in the office, which books flights and\naccommodations for White House staffers and journalists who travel with the president\nBut devilish details have transformed what was to\nhave been a one-day story into picture distinctly unflattering to the administration—a very disturbing picture, in act, for at least two reasons.\nFirst, there is the appearance of unsavory cronyism\nusually associated with low-grade courthouse politics.\nSecond, there is the Clintonites' naivereactionto the\nensuing outcry: They seem ignorant of the need to\navoid even a whiff of impropriety.\nIt is impossible to ignore thc bad smell hovering\nover the travel office dismissals, which denied the employees a chance to defend themselves.\nThe office became an object of inquiry after Hollywood TV producer Ham Thomason, a Clinton\nfriend and frequent presence at the White House,\npassed on complaints from colleagues in the air char1\nter business. The gripe: No White House travel business was coming their way.\nThen, following the dismissals, a 25-year-old distant\ncousin of the president, Catherine Comehus, was\nnamed to head the office, and the Utile Rock travel\nagency where she worked during the campaign took\nover the travel accounts.\nIt also has come out that, back in February, Cornelius and another person wrote a memo recommending changes, including a post for Cornelius, similar to\nthose that have just been made.\nThe White House says there is no connection between the memo and the unhappy fete of the traveloffice staffers, and it downplays Tnomason's role.\nWell, maybe. But this episode doesn't lookright,and\nappearances can be as important as reality.\nIn this case, it's difficult to decide which is worse:\nwhat looks like the administration's tawdry attempt to\nbestow politicalfavorsor its woeful underestimation of\nthe .public's tolerance for such chicanery.\nNeither has a place in a well-run government—one\nserving the American people, not the president's relatives, friends of his Hollywood friends or favored\nhometowr. businesses.\nif\n�A misguided policy on whaling w&\nNorway, in defiance of lhe International Whaling whales in all Iheir numbers for all time.\"\nCommission, is ready lo carry out a threal lo resume\nThis is an easy position worth easy environmental\ncommercial whaling off its shores on a limiled basis.\npoints lor countries like Ihe United Stales, wlterp\nThis naturally has triggered a liailstomi ol\" scorn, thc whaling has become an anachronism.

The EPA has threatened to cut off at least $500 million\na year in federal highway construction money i f California does not\noverhaul the program by November 15 to meet more stringent clean a i r\nstandards.\nin part, the EPA's game of California hardball i s designed to set an\nexample — anything\nless than total compliance might inspire rebellion in other states.\nBut EPA o f f i c i a l s also contend that California's law permitting both\ntesting and repairs at the same station provides a built-in conflict of\ninterest and the potential for fraud. They insist that there must be\nindependent testing stations and that they use new, sophisticated\ntesting devices called dynamometers.\nThe EPA'S regulations require the testing centers and the sophisticated\ntreadmill-type testing devices be used to police smog-producing auto\nemissions in 83 designated regions across the country, including\nsouthern California, Sacramento, Fresno and Bakersfield.\nThe Bay Area was not one of the regions listed, but a spokeswoman for\nthe Bay Area Air Quality Management District said: \"We'd go along with\nthe rest ot the state i f i t ' s a good program that's going to give us the\nmost reductions in emissions.\"\nUnder the EPA testing center plan, i f a car f a i l s a test, repairs\nwould be made at a station of the driver's choice.

They say that with a\nl i t t l e fine-tuning, the state's current program would work fine and\ni n f l i c t less inconvenience on motorists.\nDespite the inconvenience, the EPA contends that i t s approach w i l l\nimprove air quality, create jobs by staffing the testing centers,\nincrease repair work by catching more polluters and perhaps reduce the\ncost of the test because of efficiency at the testingonly centers.\n\"(What we are proposing) i s half as expensive and twice as effective\nas California's current program,\" said Douglas Eisinger, who manages\nair quality issues for the EPA's Western region.\nCalifornians pay an average of $24.50 for a smog check, plus a $7 fee\nfor a certificate. That i s one of the highest rates in the country. In\nColorado, a test costs $9. In Nevada, motorists pay $16.\nIn September, the Wilson administration appeared ready to go along\nwith the EPA, but now the governor argues that to do so would shut down\nservice stations, put people out of work and worsen California's already\npoor economic health.\n\"Wc estimate that at least 3,000 automotive technicians would lose\ntheir jobs and up to 1.300 businesses close their doors under the EPA\nplan,\" wrote Jim strock, Wilson's cabinet secretary for environmental\nprotection, and Sandy Smoley, Wilson's consumer affairs secretary, in an\nApril 22 letter to the EPA..\nFederal officials claim the state i s reacting to pressure from\nspecial interest groups.\n^Political Fallout'\n''The Legislature and the governor should be jumping for joy because\nthey can improve the nation's worst air quality and improve the economy\nat the same time,\" said Eisinger. \"Instead, the gas station industry\nhas got their ear and they're worried about the p o l i t i c a l f a l l o u t . \"\nWilson administration o f f i c i a l s deny that they are currying favor\nwith gas station owners. They say last f a l l ' s recommendations were made\nby a commission that reviewed only the technical aspects of the Smog\nCheck program, not the economic effect that changes in the program would\ncreate.\n\"This issue affects everyone, and the (EPA) approach w i l l cost us\njobs,\" said James Lee, a spokesman for strock.\nAccording to the state Bureau of Automotive Repair, $443 million i s\ngenerated from testing and repairs by the 10.3 million smog checks given\nin California each year at the 9,087 stations that participate in the\nSmog Check program. The stations employ about 21,000 mechanics and\ntechnicians.\nTwo b i l l s are stalled in the state Senate Transportation Committee to\nchange the smog check program. Neither has won approval of the EPA.\nOne measure I s by Senator Robert Presley, D-Riverside, who created\nthe current program. I t comes \"awfully c l o s e \" to satisfying the EPA,\naccording to Eisinger.\n'Gold Shield' Stations\nBasically, thia b i l l would create emissions testing centers where cars\nwould receive a smog check. Motorists whose cars failed would have to go\nto a service station or garage for repairs.\nThe EPA objects to Presley's creation oi* \"Gold S h i e l d \" smog check\ns\n�05/23/93\n23:50\nCHRONICLE CITY DESK\n004\netationa, which would allow certain service stations to test and repair\nvehicles that failed a check at a test-only center.\nThe EPA also opposes the $375 cap on repair costs in Presley's b i l l ,\nsaying i t violates an amendment to the federal Clean Air Act allowing\nonly motorists who spend $450 or more on repairs to be exempted from\nfurther testing.\nThe other b i l l , sponsored by the California Service Station &\nAutomotive Repair Association, would rejigger the current system but\ns t i i l allow both testing and repair at the sane station. That b i l l i s\n\" f a r from the mark\" said Eisinger.\nKopp held both b i l l s in committee because neither satisfies the EPA.\nKopp sides with the gas station owners, favoring a modification of the\ncurrent system with stronger fraud enforcement and installation of\nhi-tech roadside sensors to help identify polluters.\n\"A centralized testing system i s bad from the consumer/motorist\npoint of view,\" said Kopp. \" I t w i l l merely subject them to further\naggravation.''\ni\nIX:\n�SUN\n2 1 : 5 1\nARK\nD E M O C R A T\nG A Z E T\n'—\n'a 2\nPROOF of Scory 'xcclrmo' (#1460) Requested by MTYLER ($P913) on 5/23/93 21:41:18\nSneered 5/21/93 at ******** By WIRE4 Char 8,233\nChanged 5/23/93 at\nBy KYLE ^ines 303\n5-ory xcclrmo TooiC W K A Keyword IA M N A\nAKN\nODY\nSaaket ?:EWSRELEASE Deslc RELEASED Author L > O S\nE:N\nExpires 5/27/93 at 0:C0\ntcn played golf there during\nGuide 4-4211\nedited by m\nt\nthe presidential campaign.\nThe Little Rock club found\nitself in the middie of another\naclf club new Arr.old's handicap\nround of political controversy\n5Y TERRY L . 0 S\nEMN\nlast week.\nrenccrat-Gazette wash ing tor.

{"custom_id": "4_extracted-13020.json", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/chat/completions", "body": {"model": "gpt-5", "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an expert in detecting and analyzing fake news. Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context. Assign the appropriate credibility rating based on the scale above, and provide a clear justification using facts and evidence.\n\n    Output format (json):\n    You must respond with a single json object. The json object must have exactly the following keys:\n    - \"statement\": repeat the input statement text.\n    - \"speaker\": the speaker name.\n    - \"context\": the context text.\n    - \"label\": one of the six labels: \"TRUE\", \"mostly-true\", \"half-true\", \"barely-true\", \"FALSE\", or \"pants-fire\".\n    - \"justification\": a short explanation that cites evidence from the search results.\n\n    Return only this json object and nothing else.\n\n    The field \"Search Results\" below contains text snippets extracted from the top Google Search results related to the statement. These snippets are partial web page texts returned by search. Use them as factual evidence to support your evaluation. If fewer than three snippets are provided, use whatever is available.\n\n    \tStatement: Says Joe Heck voted 10 times to defund Planned Parenthood ... and Heck opposes a womans right to choose, even when her health is at risk.\n        Subject(s): abortion\n        Speaker: catherine-cortez-masto\n        Speaker's Job Title: \n        State Info: Nevada\n        Party Affiliation: democrat\n        Barely-True: 0\n        False: 1\n        Half-True: 1\n        Mostly-True: 1\n        Pants-Fire: 0\n        Context: a television ad\n        Search Results:\n        [URL1_TEXT_BEGIN]\n

{"custom_id": "4_extracted-1119.json", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/chat/completions", "body": {"model": "gpt-5", "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an expert in detecting and analyzing fake news. Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context. Assign the appropriate credibility rating based on the scale above, and provide a clear justification using facts and evidence.\n\n    Output format (json):\n    You must respond with a single json object.

EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you so much. Well, it is wonderful to be in Wakarusa. Thank you so much for the wonderful welcome. Herman, thanks for the great introduction. It is great to be back in Indiana. (Applause.) This is as close as I've gotten to home in a while. (Laughter.)\nAnd I flew out here with somebody who I think the people of Indiana have known for a long time, have trusted for a long time because he's fighting for working families in Indiana each and every day -- and that is our great Senator, Evan Bayh. Please give Evan a big round of applause. (Applause.)\nAnd it's nice to get out of Washington and spend some time with people who actually sent me to Washington. (Applause.) Too often, there are those in Washington who focus on the ups and downs of politics. But my concern is the ups and downs in the lives of the American people: the families feeling the pain of this recession; the folks I've met across this country who've lost jobs and savings and health insurance, but haven't lost hope; the men and women who still believe in the capacity, the ability of this nation to meet the challenges of our times.\nNow, these are challenges you know all too well here in Wakarusa and in Elkhart County. This area has been hit with a perfect storm of economic troubles. Over the last few decades, you've borne the brunt of a steadily weakening of American manufacturing in the face of global competition. You've felt the impact of the struggles of American auto industry and the repercussions that have hit the Midwest especially hard. And you're living every day with the consequences of this recession and the financial meltdown, and you've felt it in the form of lost jobs and lost savings.\nSo as a result, the Elkhart area has experienced the second greatest increase in the rate of unemployment in the country -– up 10 points in a year. It's an astonishing statistic. And there have been times where nearly one in five people in this area have been looking for work. You've seen factories close, and your sons and daughters move away in searches of jobs and opportunity. So this is more than an economic crisis. This goes to the heart and soul of a community. It tests the strength of families and the spirit of good people -- hardworking folks who've given their all to a company and now don't know where to turn.\nSo as a result, the Elkhart area has experienced the second greatest increase in the rate of unemployment in the country -– up 10 points in a year.

It tests the strength of families and the spirit of good people -- hardworking folks who've given their all to a company and now don't know where to turn.\nThere are some who see what's taking place here and suggest that it's all somehow inevitable, and that the only way for America to get ahead is for places like Elkhart to be left behind. You hear that argument sometime in Washington. But I know and you know that the truth is exactly the opposite. I'm here because I believe our ability to recover –- and to prosper –- as a nation depends on what happens in communities just like this one. (Applause.)\nThe battle for America's future will be fought and won in places like Elkhart and Detroit, Goshen and Pittsburgh, South Bend, Youngstown –- in cities and towns across Indiana and across the Midwest and across the country that have been the backbone of America. It will be won by making places like Elkhart what they once were and can be again –- and that's centers of innovation and entrepreneurship and ingenuity and opportunity; the bustling, whirring, humming engines of American prosperity.\nFor as the world grows more competitive, we can't afford to run the race at half-strength or half-speed. If we hope to lead this century like we did the last century, we have to create the conditions and the opportunities for places like Elkhart to succeed. We have to harness the potential –- the innovative and creative spirit –- that's waiting to be awakened all across America. That's how we'll rebuild this economy stronger than before: strong enough to compete in the global economy; strong enough to avoid the cycles of boom and bust that have wreaked so much havoc on our economy; strong enough to support the jobs of the 21st century; and strong enough to unleash prosperity for everybody, not just some.\nThe battle for America's future will be fought and won in places like Elkhart and Detroit, Goshen and Pittsburgh, South Bend, Youngstown –- in cities and towns across Indiana and across the Midwest and across the country that have been the backbone of America.

Now, that's why we passed a Recovery Act less than one month after I took office –- and we did so without any of the earmarks or pork-barrel spending that's so common in Washington, D.C. And let me just talk about the so-called stimulus package, or the Recovery Act, because there's been a lot of misinformation out there about the Recovery Act. Let me tell you what it is and what it's not.\n`The plan was divided into three parts. One-third of the money has gone to tax relief for families and small businesses. One-third of the money is cutting people's taxes. For Americans struggling to pay rising bills with shrinking wages, we kept a campaign promise to put a middle-class tax cut in the pockets of 95 percent of working families -- (applause) -- a tax cut that began showing up in paychecks of 4.8 million Indiana households about three months ago.\nWe also cut taxes for small businesses on the investments that they make. And more than 425 small businesses in Indiana have received SBA loans through the recovery package. So that's -- one-third of the money was tax cuts.\nAnother third of the money in the Recovery Act has been for emergency relief that is helping folks who've borne the brunt of this recession. For Americans who were laid off, we expanded unemployment benefits –- and that's already made a difference for 12 million Americans, including 220,000 folks right here in Indiana. We're making health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families relying on COBRA while looking for work. Some of you know people who lost their jobs, were worried about losing their health care, couldn't afford COBRA -- we were able to reduce their costs by 65 percent so they could keep their health care while they looking for jobs.\nAnd for states facing historic budget shortfalls, we provided assistance that has saved the jobs of tens of thousands of teachers and public -- and police officers and other public servants so that you wouldn't see the recession get even worse.\nSo that's the second half. First half, tax relief. Second half, support for individuals, small businesses, and states that had fallen on hard times.\nThe last third of the Recovery Act -- and that's what we're going to talk about here today -- is for investments that are not only putting people back to work in the short term, but laying a new foundation for growth and prosperity in the long run. These are the jobs of building the future of America: upgrading our roads and our bridges; renovating schools and hospitals. The Elkhart area has seen the benefits: Dozens were employed to resurface the runway at Elkhart Airport; a four-mile stretch of highway is being upgraded on US-33; the Heart City Health Center has received recovery dollars to expand services and hire additional staff.\nAnd as part of the recovery plan, we're making a historic commitment to innovation. The Recovery Act creates jobs doubling our capacity to generate renewable energy; building a new smart grid that carry electricity from coast to coast; laying down broadband lines and high-speed rail lines; and providing the largest boost in basic research in history –- to ensure that America leads in the breakthrough discoveries of the new century, just as we led in the last. Because that's what we do best in America -- we turn ideas into inventions, and inventions into industries.\nNow, history should be our guide. The United States led the world's economies in the 20th century because we led the world in innovation. Today, the competition is keener; the challenge is tougher; and that's why innovation is more important than ever. That's the key to good, new jobs in the 21st century. That's how we will ensure a high quality of life for this generation and future generations. With these investments, we're planting the seeds of progress for our country, and good-paying, private-sector jobs for the American people.\nSo that's why I'm here today -- to announce $2.4 billion in highly competitive grants to develop the next generation of fuel-efficient cars and trucks powered by the next generation of\nbattery technologies all made right here in the U.S. of A. (Applause.) Right here in America. (Applause.) Made in America. (Applause.)\nbattery technologies all made right here in the U.S. of A. (Applause.) Right here in America. (Applause.) Made in America. (Applause.)\nFor too long, we failed to invest in this kind of innovative work, even as countries like China and Japan were racing ahead. That's why this announcement is so important: This represents the largest investment in this kind of technology in American history.\nSee, I'm committed to a strategy that ensures America leads in the design and the deployment of the next generation of clean-energy vehicles. This is not just an investment to produce vehicles today; this is an investment in our capacity to develop new technologies tomorrow. This is about creating the infrastructure of innovation.\nIndiana is the second largest recipient of grant funding, and it's a perfect example of what this will mean. You've got Purdue University, Notre Dame, Indiana University, and Ivy Tech, and they're all going to be receiving grant funding to develop degree and training programs for electric vehicles. That's number one. (Applause.) We've got EnerDel, a small business in Indianapolis that will develop batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles. You've got Allison Transmission in Indianapolis, Delphi in Kokomo, Remy in Pendleton, and Magna located in Muncie, all who will help develop electric-drive components for commercial and passenger vehicles.\nAnd right here in Elkhart County, Navistar –- which has taken over two Monaco Coach manufacturing facilities -– will receive a $39 million grant to build 400 advanced battery electric trucks -- (applause) -- with a range of a hundred miles, like the trucks here today. (Applause.) Just a few months ago, folks thought that these factories might be closed for good. But now they're coming back to life.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you!\nTHE PRESIDENT: You're welcome. (Laughter.) Thank the American people. (Applause.)\nThe company estimates that this investment will help create or save hundreds of jobs in the area. And already, folks like Herman are being rehired. So, overall, the companies believe these investments in battery technology will save or create thousands of Hoosier jobs. And I want to point out these thousands of jobs wouldn't be possible if it weren't for the leaders in Congress who supported the Recovery Act -- leaders like Evan Bayh and Joe Donnelly, who's here today. (Applause.) And Andre Carson and Brad Ellsworth and Peter Visclosky. (Applause.) And these grants will create tens of thousands of jobs all across America.\nIn fact, today, Vice President Biden is announcing grant winners in Michigan. Members of my Cabinet are fanning out across the country announcing recipients elsewhere. We're providing the incentives to those businesses –- large and small –- that stand ready to help us lead a new clean-energy economy by developing new technologies for new kinds of vehicles.\nSee, I don't want to just reduce our dependence on foreign oil and then end up being dependent on their foreign innovations. I don't want to have to import a hybrid car -- I want to be able to build a hybrid car here. (Applause.) I don't want to have to import a hybrid truck -- I want to build a hybrid truck here. (Applause.) I don't want to have to import a windmill from someplace else -- I want to build a windmill right here in Indiana. (Applause.) I want the cars of the future and the technologies that power them to be developed and deployed right here, in America.\nAnd that's just the beginning. In no area will innovation be more important than in the development of new ways to produce, use, and save energy. So we're not only doubling our capacity to generate renewable energy and building a stronger and smarter electric grid. We've helped reach an agreement to raise fuel economy standards. And for the first time in history, we passed a bill to create a system of clean energy incentives which will help make renewable energy the profitable kind of energy in America -– while helping to end our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet for future generations.\nThe bill passed the House; we're now working to pass legislation through the Senate. Because we know that real innovation depends not on government, but on the generative potential of the American people. If the American people get a clear set of rules, if they know what's needed, what challenges we've got to meet, they'll figure out how to do it.\nIn fact, that's why our budget makes the research and experimentation tax credit permanent -- the R&D tax credit. This is a tax credit that helps companies afford what are sometimes very high costs in developing new ideas and new technologies and new products –- and that means new jobs. This tax credit returns $2 to the economy for every $1 we spend. And for a long time we were just trying to renew it once every year, and companies didn't know whether or not they were going to be able to get it for the next year. That's changed. We've now made it permanent.\nI've also proposed reducing to zero the capital gains tax for investments in small or startup businesses. Because small businesses are innovative businesses; small businesses produce 13 times more patents per employee than large companies.\nOf course, in order to lead in the global economy and ensure that our businesses can grow and innovate, we also have to pass health insurance reform that brings down costs. (Applause.) Reform that brings down costs and provides more security for folks who have insurance, and affordable options for those who don't. I promise you: We will pass reform by the end of this year because the American people need it. (Applause.) The American people need some relief. (Applause.) We're going to have to make it happen.\nIn fact, the recovery plan began the process of reform by modernizing our health care infrastructure. We took some long-overdue step of computerizing America's health records, which can reduce all the waste and errors that cost billions of dollars and thousands of lives –- while protecting patients' privacy. It's important also to know that these records hold the potential of offering patients the chance to be more active participants in the prevention and treatment of illnesses. You won't have to fill out the same form a dozen times. You won't have to rely on your memory when talking to your doctor about your medical history. All those things make people healthier, but they also reduce your costs, lower your premiums, give you more security in your health care.\nNow, in addition to energy, and in addition to health care, we also know that the nation that out-educates us today will out-compete us tomorrow. So we're making a historic commitment to strengthening and improving education, from cradle through career. Right now, our schools continue to trail many of our competitors. And that's why I've challenged states to dramatically improve achievement by raising standards and modernizing science labs, upgrading curriculum, forming new partnerships to promote math and science, and improving the use of technology in the classroom.\nAnd I've set this goal: In the next decade –- by 2020 –- America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. (Applause.) We used to be number one. We will be number one again when it comes to college graduates. (Applause.)\nNow, to reach this goal, we've provided tax credits and grants to make college education more affordable and we've made a historic commitment to community colleges, which are the unsung heroes in America's education system. America can and must have the best-educated, highest-skilled workforce in the world -- because if we're building new cars here in America, if we're building a new clean-energy grid in America, then we're also going to need to build engineers in America, and scientists in America, and skilled technicians right here in America. So all these pieces end up fitting together.\nEnergy and innovation, health care and education -- these are the pillars of the new foundation that we have to build. This is how we won't just rescue the economy, but we're going to rebuild it stronger than before.\nNow, there are a lot of people out there those who are looking to defend the status quo. There are those who want to seek political advantage. They want to oppose these efforts. Some of them caused the problems that we got now in the first place, and then suddenly they're blaming other folks for it. (Applause.) They don't want to be constructive. They don't want to be constructive; they just want to get in the usual political fights back and forth. And sometimes that's fed by all the cable chatter on the media.\nBut you and I know the truth. We know that even in the hardest times, against the toughest odds, we have never surrendered. We don't give up. We don't surrender our fates to chance. We have always endured. We have worked hard, and we have fought for our future. Our parents had to fight for their future; our grandparents had to fight for their future. That's the tradition of America. This country wasn't built just by griping and complaining. It was built by hard work and taking risks. (Applause.) And that's what we have to do today.\nSo I know these are tough times. If you haven't lost a job, you know somebody who has -- maybe a family member, a neighbor, a friend. You know that as difficult as the financial struggle can be, the sense of loss when you lose your job is about more than just a paycheck. We as Americans, we define ourselves by the work we do. It's a source of pride; a sense that you're contributing, that you're supporting your family, that you're doing the right thing, that you're responsible. And the truth is, it can be easy to lose hope, especially when you see a lot of folks out there who failed to meet their responsibilities –- from Wall Street to Washington. It can be easy to grow cynical when you see politicians say one thing and then do another, or say one thing and then do nothing; when you've seen decades of broken promises and broken politics.\nSo I know these are tough times.

This is a chance to restore that spirit of optimism and opportunity which has always been central to our success. We've got to set our sights higher, not lower. We've got to imagine a future in which new American cars are powered by new American innovation; a future in which cities that led the global economy before are leading it again; a brighter future for Elkhart, a brighter future for Indiana, and for the United States of America. (Applause.)\nThat's what we're fighting for. That's what this plant is about. That's what you're about. That's what we're going to achieve in the weeks and months to come. (Applause.)\nSo thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you. (Applause.)\nEND 12:19 P.M.

Here’s what they found: HILLARY CLINTON ON HER GRANDDAUGHTER’S SECOND BIRTHDAY “The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we’ll build together. Today is my granddaughter’s second birthday, so I think about this a lot.” More on that… Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are grandparents. This is the first time that has been true of both major party nominees since 1932 when Franklin Delano Roosevelt ran against then President Herbert Hoover. — Lisa Desjardins, Correspondent HILLARY CLINTON ON PROFIT SHARING “I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.” More on that… Clinton mentions profit-sharing in her opening. Will she talk about worker ownership at some point? — Paul Solman, Business and economics correspondent DONALD TRUMP ON TAXES “Under my plan, I’ll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That’s going to be a job creator like we haven’t seen since Ronald Reagan. It’s going to be a beautiful thing to watch.” Here’s what we know… Donald Trump proposes to cut corporate taxes from 35 percent to 15 percent, but he also says he would end some unspecified corporate loopholes. For individuals, Trump proposes cutting taxes for all income groups, not just the wealthy. — Lisa Desjardins, Correspondent Here’s what we know… Trump’s revised tax plan does cut for all income groups, but an independent analysis by the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation also found that the wealthiest taxpayers would see a much larger tax break than the middle class or lower-income. That’s to be expected at some level because of the amount of income the wealthiest are earning and the taxes they pay. But the Tax Foundation analysis suggested the Trump plan would not reduce taxes tremendously for everyone. It found the top 1 percent would get a 10 to 16 percent boost in after-tax income. Those in middle-class tax brackets would get a smaller break, somewhere between 1 to 2 percent in after-tax income. It should be said that Clinton’s plans do not call for any significant tax relief for the middle class, though she puts her emphasis on other economic proposals for the middle-class and lower-income Americans with a big hike on the wealthiest taxpayers. — Murrey Jacobson, Senior Producer of National Affairs Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images HILLARY CLINTON ON JOBS “We need new jobs, good jobs with rising incomes. I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy…” More on that… You know what creates jobs? Renewable energy. In fact, clean energy jobs surpassed oil and natural gas last year, with jobs in the solar industry growing 12 times faster than overall job creation. — Nsikan Akpan, Science producer DONALD TRUMP ON CLIMATE CHANGE “CLINTON: Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax, perpetrated by the Chinese. TRUMP: I did not — I do not say that. CLINTON: I think it’s real… TRUMP: I do not say that — CLINTON: …and I think that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. Here’s what we know… In January 2014, Trump tweeted: This very expensive GLOBAL WARMING bullshit has got to stop. Our planet is freezing, record low temps,and our GW scientists are stuck in ice — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2014 In a subsequent tweet, Trump said: “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.” The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 His policy positions include withdrawing from the Paris agreement limiting carbon emissions and removing carbon emission caps on U.S. power plants. — Margaret Warner, Chief foreign correspondent HILLARY CLINTON ON JOB CREATION “They’ve looked at my plans and they’ve said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.” A reminder… Hillary Clinton said her proposals will create 10 million new jobs. When Clinton says that, she’s citing a Moody’s Analytics analysis conducted by economist Mark Zandi and others. FactCheck.org looked at this analysis and provided further caveats. Moody’s Analytics concluded that if Clinton were able to fully implement the plans she has outlined in her campaign, the economy would add 10.4 million jobs during Clinton’s presidency. But that’s just 3.2 million more than it projects would be added under current law. Moreover, Moody’s Analytics doesn’t expect Clinton would likely be able to pass all of her proposals through a divided Congress. “Given the current political discord,” Moody’s expects Congress would put up “substantial roadblocks” to Clinton’s policy proposals. Even under its “most-likely scenario,” concludes Moody’s, a Clinton presidency would result in employment going just “a bit higher” than it otherwise would — putting the U.S. on a path to create 1.5 million more jobs over 10 years than is expected under current law. — Murrey Jacobson, Senior producer of National Affairs CLINTON AND TRUMP ON THE TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP “TRUMP: And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, ‘I can’t win that debate.’ But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA.” CLINTON: “Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in — TRUMP: “You called it the gold standard. You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it’s the finest deal you’ve ever seen.” CLINTON: No. TRUMP: “And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.” Here’s what we know… Clinton is walking a very tricky line here. At a 2012 speech in Australia, then Secretary Clinton did endorse the Trans Pacific Partnership. She is now trying to say that endorsement was aspirational. But look at the remarks. She said, “this TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.” In 2014, Clinton became more reserved on the potential deal. But in 2012, she said TPP was the gold standard. Not that she hoped it would be. — Lisa Desjardins, Correspondent DONALD TRUMP ON RELEASING TAX RETURNS “I’ve been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. I say, ‘Do you get audited?’ I get audited almost every year. And in a way, I should be complaining. I’m not even complaining. I don’t mind it. It’s almost become a way of life. I get audited by the IRS, but other people don’t. I will say this: We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. I will release my tax returns against my lawyers’ wishes when she releases her 33,000 emails that have been deleted.” Here’s what we know… Trump’s tax attorneys wrote that his taxes have been audited since 2002, so the 15 years figure is correct. But nearly half of those audits, from 2002 to 2008, are closed. He could release those without fear of IRS problems. More on that… The 33,000 emails deleted from Hillary Clinton’s servers by her staff seem to be unrecoverable — neither the FBI nor other investigations could recover them. Thus, when Trump offers to release his taxes if Clinton would release her deleted emails, he might as well offer to release his taxes if someone could provide the missing 18 minutes from the Nixon Watergate tape. — Lisa Desjardins, Correspondent DONALD TRUMP ON SPENDING IN THE MIDDLE EAST “We’ve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report I just saw.” Here’s what we know… That report cited by Donald Trump is (likely) this report from professor Neta Crawford at Brown University, who tabulated not only what has been spent during 15 years of war in Afghanistan and 13-plus years in Iraq, but the operations in Syria to repel ISIS, and the secret war the U.S. has fought against al Qaida and other militant groups in Pakistan. The costs also count future operations and the generational costs accrued to care for veterans of these wars since 9/11. — Morgan Till, Senior producer of Foreign Affairs HILLARY CLINTON ON GUARDING AGAINST TERROR “What do we do here in the United States? That’s the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people? And I think we’ve got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.” More on that… The debate over how to prevent attacks in the United States centers, in part, on what’s called “combatting violent extremism.” It’s a theory used to prevent the radicalization of young people predominantly, and it has both fervent supporters and severe detractors. Supporters say it provides “off-ramps” for people who entertain radical ideas. Its detractors say it encourages suspicion with communities — in many cases, Muslim communities — and a culture of informing. In Western Europe, the programs work in many cases, with substantial government involvement. The United States government is only now creating official programs on combatting violent extremism. The reason it’s happening only now? For years, the modus operandi of U.S. law enforcement was to do one of two things: either turn potential radicals into informants, or arrest them. The NewsHour has covered this topic in depth. Producer P.J. Tobia reported on this topic in July, and anchor Hari Sreenivasan profiled former radical Jesse Morton last month. Morton is now working with George Washington University within its program on the study of extremism, which seeks to study and prevent the same. — Morgan Till, Senior producer of Foreign Affairs DONALD TRUMP ON STOP AND FRISK “We have to bring back law and order. Now, whether or not, in a place like Chicago, you do stop-and-frisk, which worked very well — Mayor Giuliani is here — worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down…” More on that… Stop-and-frisk has become a very controversial policy, one that has ended up in the courts as both Trump and Holt referred to tonight. Its proponents say it does work at reducing crime and violence. But The Washington Post’s fact checker has pointed out that prior claims Trump has made about the value of stop-and-frisk is not nearly as clear as he suggests. It pointed out that even after stop-and-frisk was stopped in 2013, crime rates continued to fall in New York, suggesting that it’s hard to attribute crime rate drops directly to the policy. — Murrey Jacobson, Senior producer of National Affairs DONALD TRUMP ON HOWARD STERN AND THE IRAQ WAR TRUMP: “I was against the war in Iraq. Just so you put it out –” LESTER HOLT: “The record shows otherwise. So why is your judgment–” TRUMP: “…The record shows that I’m right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern — very lightly, first time anyone’s ever asked me that — I said, very lightly, ‘I dunno. Maybe. Who knows?’” Here’s what we know… As we saw from Trump’s lengthy defense, he feels strongly that he has always opposed the Iraq War. But the audio indicates differently. It all comes down to one syllable: “Yeah.” On Sept. 11, 2002, Stern asked Trump if he supported the invasion. He responded, “Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.” –Lisa Desjardins, correspondent HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP ON MENTAL HEALTH REFORM CLINTON: “Now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health challenges on the street. They want support, they want more training, more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we could offer and provide that.” Here’s what we know… Both candidates have advocated for substantive mental health care reform and say that law enforcement officers will play a crucial role. Clinton has released a detailed plan pushing for early diagnosis and intervention, better integration of the nation’s mental and physical health care systems, better training of law enforcement officers in crisis intervention, and “prioritizing treatment over jail for non-violent, low-level offenders.” Trump has released far fewer details, calling for more support for families that are looking for tools to help their loved ones. He also supports “promising reforms being developed in Congress that should receive bi-partisan support” (without specifying which ones he supports). In response to a questionnaire from the International Association of Chiefs of Police about law enforcement’s role, Trump stated that “unfortunately, law enforcement will have to continue to play a role in how we proceed as a nation with mental health reform.” –Jason Kane, Health producer DONALD TRUMP ON FORD OPENING A PLANT IN MEXICO So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They’re all leaving. And we can’t allow it to happen anymore. Here’s what we know… It is true that Ford is opening a plant in Mexico. But Ford’s CEO has denied the opening of that plant will mean cutting jobs in the U.S. More here from the Detroit News. –Murrey Jacobson, Senior Producer of National Affairs DONALD TRUMP ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE “And we have a Fed that’s doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political — by keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me, the day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf when they raise interest rates, you’re going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.” More on that… As the New York Times’ Binyamin Appelbaum wrote tonight, “This is a baseless accusation.” The Federal Reserve’s actions have been criticized and suspected for political motives multiple times, including former Fed chair Alan Greenspan’s decision to endorse President George W. Bush’s tax cuts and former Chairman Ben Bernanke’s decisions to bail out banks during the financial crisis. Its actions have also been scrutinized and criticized in prior election seasons. The Los Angeles Times reminds us that White House recordings show President Richard Nixon tried to pressure Fed Chairman Arthur Burns. And that President George H.W. Bush attributed part of his re-election loss on then-Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. But let’s be clear: So far, Trump has not offered anything beyond an assertion for his allegation. It is true the Fed has not raised rates recently even though many observers once thought a second rate increase was likely this year. But the Fed rarely raises or cuts rates in the months right before an election. More significantly, most experts strongly say that jobs growth, unemployment, inflation and multiple other economic measures (including the strength or lack thereof a recovery, not to mention global growth) are what drive the decisions of Yellen and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Moreover, just last week, Yellen adamantly denied any political influence into the Fed’s decision-making. One other point: Mr. Trump endorsed leaving interest rates where they were just last May. –Murrey Jacobson, Senior producer of National Affairs HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP ON SUPPORTING THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION LESTER HOLT: One of you will not win this election. So my final question to you tonight: Are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters? Secretary Clinton? HILLARY CLINTON: Well, I support our democracy. And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I certainly will support the outcome of this election… LESTER HOLT: …Will you accept the outcome of the election? DONALD TRUMP: I want to make America great again. I’m gonna be able to do it; I don’t believe Hillary will. The answer is: If she wins, I will absolutely support her. More on that… This was an important moment. Donald Trump, in particular, has warned that he thinks the election could be rigged. That has led to headlines fearing unrest should Trump lose. Having both candidates state clearly that they will support the results of the election brought some much-needed de-escalation to that discussion. That does not mean the risk of unrest is erased. But it was significant for this country, which prides itself on a regular, peaceful transition of power. –Lisa Desjardins, Correspondent A free press is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy.

Full Episode Wednesday, Nov 26\nOur team of in-house experts analyzed, fact checked and added context to the candidates’ statements as the debate happened. Here’s what they found: HILLARY CLINTON ON HER GRANDDAUGHTER’S SECOND BIRTHDAY “The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we’ll build together. Today is my granddaughter’s second birthday, so I think about this a lot.” More on that… Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are grandparents. This is the first time that has been true of both major party nominees since 1932 when Franklin Delano Roosevelt ran against then President Herbert Hoover. — Lisa Desjardins, Correspondent HILLARY CLINTON ON PROFIT SHARING “I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.” More on that… Clinton mentions profit-sharing in her opening. Will she talk about worker ownership at some point? — Paul Solman, Business and economics correspondent DONALD TRUMP ON TAXES “Under my plan, I’ll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That’s going to be a job creator like we haven’t seen since Ronald Reagan. It’s going to be a beautiful thing to watch.” Here’s what we know… Donald Trump proposes to cut corporate taxes from 35 percent to 15 percent, but he also says he would end some unspecified corporate loopholes. For individuals, Trump proposes cutting taxes for all income groups, not just the wealthy. — Lisa Desjardins, Correspondent Here’s what we know… Trump’s revised tax plan does cut for all income groups, but an independent analysis by the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation also found that the wealthiest taxpayers would see a much larger tax break than the middle class or lower-income. That’s to be expected at some level because of the amount of income the wealthiest are earning and the taxes they pay. But the Tax Foundation analysis suggested the Trump plan would not reduce taxes tremendously for everyone. It found the top 1 percent would get a 10 to 16 percent boost in after-tax income. Those in middle-class tax brackets would get a smaller break, somewhere between 1 to 2 percent in after-tax income. It should be said that Clinton’s plans do not call for any significant tax relief for the middle class, though she puts her emphasis on other economic proposals for the middle-class and lower-income Americans with a big hike on the wealthiest taxpayers. — Murrey Jacobson, Senior Producer of National Affairs Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images HILLARY CLINTON ON JOBS “We need new jobs, good jobs with rising incomes. I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy…” More on that… You know what creates jobs? Renewable energy. In fact, clean energy jobs surpassed oil and natural gas last year, with jobs in the solar industry growing 12 times faster than overall job creation. — Nsikan Akpan, Science producer DONALD TRUMP ON CLIMATE CHANGE “CLINTON: Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax, perpetrated by the Chinese. TRUMP: I did not — I do not say that. CLINTON: I think it’s real… TRUMP: I do not say that — CLINTON: …and I think that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. Here’s what we know… In January 2014, Trump tweeted: This very expensive GLOBAL WARMING bullshit has got to stop. Our planet is freezing, record low temps,and our GW scientists are stuck in ice — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2014 In a subsequent tweet, Trump said: “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.” The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 His policy positions include withdrawing from the Paris agreement limiting carbon emissions and removing carbon emission caps on U.S. power plants. — Margaret Warner, Chief foreign correspondent HILLARY CLINTON ON JOB CREATION “They’ve looked at my plans and they’ve said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.” A reminder… Hillary Clinton said her proposals will create 10 million new jobs.

Click HERE to watch this interactive video.\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump tangled in an intense series of exchanges tonight during 2016's first general-election presidential debate, moderated by NBC's Lester Holt. The candidates made charges about each other's records while defending their own careers and policy proposals.\nBut were they always telling the truth? How often did Trump and Clinton spin facts to fit their arguments?\nABC News fact-checked some of the most noteworthy claims made in the debate:\nFact-check No. 1: Trump claims he did not say global warming is hoax perpetrated by the Chinese\nClinton: \"Because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax, perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real.\"\nTrump: \"I did not. I did not. I do not say that. I do not say that.\"\nGrade: False\nExplanation: Trump tweeted in November 2012 that the \"concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese.\" This tweet resurfaced in January 2016, when former Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders pointed it out on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" The next day, Trump addressed the comment on \"Fox & Friends,\" saying his tweet was basically a joke, saying, \"I often joke that this is done for the benefit of the Chinese. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change.\" He has, on other occasions from 2012 to 2015, called global warming a hoax, though he has not attributed it to the Chinese.\nFact-check No. 2: Clinton has been fighting ISIS her \"entire adult life\"\nTrump: \"See, you are telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you have been, no wonder you have been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.\"\nGrade: False\nExplanation: ISIS has its origins in al-Qaeda in Iraq, the Sunni insurgent group founded in 2004 after the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq. In 2013, the group rebranded itself as the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) and shifted operations to include Syria, where the civil war enabled its growth and resurgence. This occurred after Clinton had finished serving as secretary of state. Clinton is 68 years old and turned 18 in 1965, almost 51 years ago.\nFact-check No. 3: Trump started his business with $14 million borrowed from his father\nClinton: \"Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-business man. He worked really hard.\"\nGrade: Yes and no\nExplanation: Trump claims that his business grew out of a $1 million loan from his father in 1975. But a casino license disclosure from 1985 shows that in the late 1970s and early 1980s Trump took $14 million in loans from his father and his father's properties, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nFact-check No. 4: Trump said Clinton called the Trans-Pacific Partnership the \"gold standard\" of trade deals\nTrump: \"You called it the gold standard. You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you have ever seen, and then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.\"\nGrade: Yes and no.\nExplanation: Clinton said the TPP \"sets the gold standard\" and has used many other glowing terms to describe the agreement, but she did not say it was the \"finest deal\" she has ever seen. While Clinton served as secretary of state, she promoted the TPP well after negotiations began in 2010, saying in 2012 in Australia that it \"sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.\" She used many other complimentary words — including \"exciting,\" \"innovative,\" \"ambitious,\" \"groundbreaking,\" \"cutting edge,\" \"high quality\" and \"high standard\" — according to a compilation by the fact-checking site PolitiFact — but there are no records of her saying it was \"the greatest deal\" she had \"ever seen.\" Furthermore, Clinton began to moderate her position on the TPP as she began preparing her second presidential bid, culminating with a full renunciation of it during a 2015 PBS interview, in which she said, \"As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.\" It is worth noting that she was not serving as secretary of state when the deal was finalized. Clinton countered Trump in Monday's debate by trying to clarify that she said she had \"hoped\" TPP would set a gold standard for trade. But it is clear from her 2012 remarks that at least one time in public, she declared that it \"set\" the gold standard, with no qualifiers.\nFact-check No. 5: Trump says he has not suggested that he would negotiate down the national debt\nClinton: \"And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself the king of debt. You talk about leverage. You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the ...\"\nTrump: \"Wrong, wrong.\"\nClinton: \"... national debt of the United States. Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.\"\nGrade: Yes and no\nExplanation: Trump suggested he would renegotiate the national debt in an interview with CNBC on May 5, 2016, but then said in The Wall Street Journal on May 10, 2016 that he would buy back U.S. debt at a discount. \"I'm only saying you can buy back … I'm saying if interest rates go up, you can buy debt at a discount on the market — just on the market. You just buy back debt on — at a discount,\" he told the Journal.\nFact-check No. 6: \"Hillary Clinton also fought it\" — insisting Barack Obama is not a natural-born citizen, which is the basis of the birther movement\nTrump: \"Well nobody was pressing it. Nobody was caring much about it. I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job. Secretary Clinton also fought it, I mean, you know — now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true. Look, it's true.\"\nGrade: False\nExplanation: A Politico report has linked Clinton's most ardent supporters to the circulation during the 2008 campaign cycle of an e-mail suggesting that Obama was born in Kenya. But no evidence has ever been found connecting this claim to Clinton or her campaign. Since 2008, no fact checker or journalist has uncovered any evidence linking Clinton or her campaign to the start of the birther movement. An ABC News analysis found Trump tweeted 67 times about the birther movement, including after Obama released his birth certificate.\nFact-check No. 7: Trump on the Iraq War\nTrump: \"I did not support the war in Iraq ... I was against the war in Iraq.\"\nGrade: False\nExplanation: Trump expressed support for the invasion of Iraq before expressing some reservations.\nAsked by Howard Stern on Sept. 11, 2002, if he was \"for invading Iraq,\" Trump at the time answered, \"Yeah, I guess so.\"\nBut by Jan. 28, 2003, Trump expressed some concern about the possibility of an invasion, telling Fox Business' Neil Cavuto that President George W. Bush \"has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet, and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know.\" On March 21, 2003, soon after the invasion of Iraq began, Trump told Cavuto that the war \"looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint.\" While Trump now portrays himself as having been an outspoken opponent of the invasion, his public statements in the lead-up to the invasion tell a different story.\nFact-check No. 8: Clinton says Trump advocated for the actions the US took in Libya\nClinton: \"He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya. And urged that Gaddafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.\"\nGrade: Mostly true\nExplanation: In a video posted on his YouTube video blog in February 2011, Trump called for intervention in Libya. \"It's a carnage,\" he said. \"Now, we should go in, we should stop this guy, which would be very easy and very quick, we could do it surgically, and save these lives.\" Later he claimed to have never discussed Libya (false) and to have supported a surgical intervention — killing Gaddafi only and not taking any other actions.\nFact-check No. 9: Trump said it was \"wrong\" that he had been \"praiseworthy\" of Russian President Vladimir Putin, as Clinton claimed\nClinton: \"There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyberattacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald is very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin.\"\nGrade: False\nExplanation: Trump has publicly said favorable things about Putin numerous times, usually while criticizing Obama. In a GOP primary debate hosted by NBC News, Trump described his strategy for dealing with Putin, saying, \"I would talk to him. I would get along with him.\" In a recent NBC forum, in which the network separately interviewed Clinton, Trump defended his comments, pointing to strong domestic polling for Putin. When Putin authored an op-ed on Syria in The New York Times, in September 2013, Trump tweeted that it was a \"masterpiece for Russia and a disaster for the U.S.\" Interviewed by MSNBC, Trump said of Putin, \"He's running his country, and at least he's a leader, you know, unlike what we have in this country.\"\nFact-check No. 10: Trump on crime rates\nClinton: \"Under the current [New York City] mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.\"\nTrump: \"You're wrong ... Murders are up.\"\nGrade: Mostly false\nExplanation: New York City mayor Bill de Blasio was sworn into office on Jan. 1, 2014. Each of his first two years in office saw an overall drop in the seven major felonies, and so far this year major crimes are down nearly 3 percent, compared with the same period last year. Murder statistics present a slightly more complicated picture during de Blasio's tenure. His first year in office saw 333 murders, two fewer than the year before. But his second year in office saw an uptick to 352 murders. So far this year, murders in New York City are down more than 4 percent from the same period last year (246 murders through Sept. 18, 2016, versus 257 murders in the same span in 2015).\nFact-check No. 11: Clinton: Trump said \"he didn't care\" if Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia get nuclear weapons\nClinton: \"And the worst part ... of what we've heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons — Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. It has been the policy of the United States — Democrats and Republicans — to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He even said, well, if there were a nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine.\"\nTrump: \"Wrong.\"\nGrade: Yes and no\nExplanation: Trump has said that America's allies should pay more of their defense costs. Earlier this year he seemed to say that Japan might be better off if it had nuclear weapons to defend itself from North Korea. At a town hall in March he seemed to support Saudi Arabia's having nuclear weapons but quickly reversed himself. In June he denied that he wanted Japan to get nuclear weapons. He wants America's allies to take more responsibility for their defense and has at times indicated it would be OK for Japan to have access to nuclear weapons to defend itself from North Korea.\nFact-check No. 12: Trump denies saying that pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers\nClinton: \"One thing, Lester, he tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs. And someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers.\"\nTrump: \"I never said that.\"\nGrade: False\nExplanation: Trump said just that in an October 2004 interview with NBC's \"Dateline.\" In the interview he said pregnancy is \"a wonderful thing for the woman. It's a wonderful thing for the husband. It's certainly an inconvenience for a business. And whether people want to say that or not, the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business.\"\nFact-check No. 13: Trump on stop and frisk\nHolt: \"Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men —\"\nTrump: \"No, you're wrong. It went before a judge who was a very against police judge. It was taken away from her, and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places.\"\nGrade: Mostly false\nExplanation: Holt was correct. In August 2013 a federal district judge ruled the NYPD's stop-and-frisk tactics violated the constitutional rights of minorities, calling it a \"policy of indirect racial profiling.\" Mayor Michael Bloomberg appealed the case. The 2nd Circuit Court temporarily blocked the judge's orders and removed her from the case, finding she had compromised \"the appearance of impartiality surrounding this litigation.\" But the court stopped short of overturning her ruling.\nThe stop-and-frisk program was still in the midst of the appeals process when newly elected Mayor Bill de Blasio, who supported the district court ruling, settled the litigation and ended the controversial program.\nFact-check No. 14: Trump says stop and frisk works \"well\"\nTrump: \"Over 4 — almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order. Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well — [former New York] Mayor Giuliani is here, it worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down, but you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.\"\nGrade: Yes and no\nExplanation: There has been much debate about whether stop and frisk is effective. Trump often cites the example of the tactic being used by police in New York City, as he did this evening. While violent crime fell in New York City while stop and frisk was implemented, the crime rate also fell nationally and in places where police did not employ the tactic. Stop and frisk may have some limited impact, but it is not clear how effective it is. According to NYCLU data, guns were recovered in only 0.2 percent of cases.\nAccording to an NYPD spokesman, the use of stop and frisk has decreased nearly 97 percent in New York City since 2011, and crime has decreased significantly during the same period. NYPD statistics bear this out.\nFact-check No. 15: Clinton claims Trump's tax plan would add $5 trillion to the debt and cost the economy jobs\nClinton: \"Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically, they've said this: that if his tax plan — which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle class families, compared to the wealthy — were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.\"\nGrade: True\nExplanation: Under Trump's current tax and spending proposal, the debt over the next decade would increase by about $5 trillion, according to Moody's latest estimate. An estimate from the Committee for a Responsible Budget says, \"Both Clinton and Trump would increase the debt relative to current law — though Trump would increase it by an order of magnitude more, and Clinton's plan would slightly reduce deficits if we incorporated unspecified revenue from business tax reform. Specifically, we estimate Clinton's plans would add $200 billion to the debt over the next decade, while Trump's plans would add $5.3 trillion.\nFact-check No. 16: Trump on the Democratic National Committee hack\nTrump: \"I don't know if anyone knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't — maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. Could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK? You don't know who broke into DNC.\"\nGrade: Mostly false\nExplanation: U.S. officials — speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the information — have uniformly told ABC News and other major news outlets that evidence in the Democratic National Committee hack points directly to Russia. In addition, the firm hired by the DNC to respond to the suspected breach, CrowdStrike, conducted an investigation and later issued a statement saying it \"identified two sophisticated adversaries\" as being behind the hack. \"Both adversaries engage in extensive political and economic espionage for the benefit of the government of the Russian Federation and are believed to be closely linked to the Russian government's powerful and highly capable intelligence services,\" CrowdStrike said. Just last week, the top Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence committees, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., issued a statement saying, \"Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election. At the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election — we can see no other rationale for the behavior of the Russians.\"\nFact-check No. 17: Trump says Ford is moving jobs out of the US\nTrump: \"Ford is leaving. You see that. Their small car division, leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio, they're all leaving.\"\nGrade: Mostly false\nExplanation: Though Ford has announced it is moving production of the small Ford Focus to a new plant in Mexico, the company tells ABC the move will have \"absolutely no impact on U.S. jobs.\" While the new plant begins production of the Focus, workers at the Michigan plant that manufactured the car will make two new vehicles.\nABC News' Margaret Chadbourn, Sarah Kolinovsky, Justin Fishel, Luis Martinez, Lauren Pearle, Ali Rogin, Katherine Faulders, Alana Abramson, Ryan Struyk, Ely Brown, Chris Good, Mike Levine, Jordyn Phelps, Jack Date, Erin Dooley and Zunaira Zaki contributed to this report.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Where the candidate stands on 9 issues Politics Updated on Dec 18, 2019 7:00 PM EST — Published on Feb 19, 2019 1:03 PM EST Brooklyn-born Bernie Sanders is a nearly 30-year veteran of Congress who considers himself a democratic socialist. He marched on Washington in 1963, moved to Vermont the next year, and ultimately ran seven statewide races there (losing four, winning three). In 2016, the Vermont senator became the first Jewish candidate (and first non-Christian) to win a presidential primary. He tells high school students to argue with their parents and teachers, and is an ardent anti-war activist and advocate for military veterans. Sanders has been a popular mayor, a Senate committee chairman, an early social media and filibuster phenomenon, and once recorded a folk album in the style of William Shatner. Here is where he stands on nine key issues. Campaign finance: Refuse corporate donations. Limit corporate and interest group spending in campaigns. Like he did in 2016, Sanders has refused corporate donations and relied on small donors to fund his White House campaign. He has proposed a constitutional amendment that would effectively reverse the Supreme Court’s Citizen United ruling and ban corporations and nonprofits from making unlimited campaign expenditures. He would also require any organization to disclose election-related campaign expenditures of $10,000 or more. Climate change: Cut carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030. Tax carbon emissions. Sanders would institute a carbon tax and aim to slash U.S. emissions by 40 percent by the year 2030, and 80 percent by 2050. He would end all federal subsidies for the gas, oil and coal industries. In addition, he would investigate corporations he sees as “climate deniers” that have spent money raising doubts about climate change. He is a co-sponsor of a resolution calling for a “Green New Deal.” Education: Free, universal preschool. Free tuition at public colleges and universities. The Vermont senator would make preschool free for all 4-year-olds, funding the plan by increasing taxes on the wealthy and some Wall Street transactions. In higher education, Sanders’ “College for All Act” would make tuition at four-year public colleges free for most Americans; two-thirds of the program would be paid for with federal funds, and one-third with state funds. Sanders would pay for the federal portion with what he calls a Wall Street speculation fee of 0.5 percent on stock trades. Federal Reserve and banks: Break up big banks. Open up the Fed. Sanders would divide large banks — those with assets worth more than 3 percent of the nation’s GDP — into smaller entities and charge a new fee for high-risk investment practices, including credit default swaps. He would also ban financial industry executives from serving on the central bank’s 12 regional boards of directors. Guns: Ban assault weapons. Repeal law protecting some gun manufacturers. No federal handgun waiting period. A gun-control advocate, Sanders would ban assault weapons as well as high-capacity magazines or equipment that allow more than ten rounds to be fired at once. He supports universal background checks and voted for the Manchin-Toomey legislation expanding federal background checks. In early 2016, Sanders changed his position on a gun law that protects some gun manufacturers and sellers from civil lawsuits. Sanders supported the measure in 2005 while he was serving in the House of Representatives. In 2016, he co-sponsored a bill to repeal that law. In the House, Sanders also voted against the pro-gun-control Brady Bill, writing that he believes states, not the federal government, can handle waiting periods for handguns. He told student reporters from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that he voted no on the Brady Bill because his state preferred “automatic background checks” and not waiting periods. Health care: Original supporter of “Medicare for All.” Sanders proposes a government-run health care system for all Americans. He was the lead Senate sponsor of the 2017 “Medicare For All” bill, which would launch universal health care and end employer-provided health insurance. A report released by the Urban Institute in October found that his single-payer approach would cost $34 trillion dollars over 10 years, more than the total cost of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid combined. “Look, I am not denying that we’re going to spend a lot of money,” Sanders told PBS NewsHour in response to criticism about the potential costs of his plans. “But [critics] cannot deny that we’re saving people substantial sums of money by eliminating all premiums.” Immigration: Path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants. Restructure, don’t necessarily abolish U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Most undocumented immigrants who are in the country now would receive a path to citizenship under Sanders’ immigration plan. He voted for the 2013 Senate immigration bill that proposed a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, doubling the number of border patrol officers, and providing an additional 350 miles of border fencing. (That bill did not become law.) Sanders would like to restructure ICE. But he has not given details and has not gone so far as to say that he thinks the agency should be “abolished,” a position some of his 2020 Democratic rivals have taken. Social Issues: Abortion should be legal, with few or no government limits. Opposes policies that discriminate based on sexual preference or gender identity. Sanders is a supporter of abortion rights and voted against a bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks. When asked in 2016 if he would place any limits on abortions, Sanders did not give a specific answer but repeatedly said he was “very strongly pro-choice” and believed the decision was between a woman and her doctor. On LGBTQ rights, Sanders has touted his early moves in support of the gay rights movement. In 1983, as mayor of Burlington, he approved a resolution declaring “Gay Rights Day;” in 1993, he opposed the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy; and in 2000 he supported gay civil unions in Vermont. He opposes President Donald Trump’s push to ban transgender people from the military, and laws that would block transgender people from using the bathrooms of their choice. Foreign Policy: Use diplomacy to end Syrian conflict. Pull out troops, but in different way from Trump. Cut U.S. support in the conflict in Yemen, hold the Saudi crown prince “accountable” for crimes. Sanders would pull U.S. troops from Syria, but said he would do it in a different, less “erratic” way than Trump recently announced. He believes diplomacy with Russia and Iran can turn things around in Syria. He also believes the president did not have the right to launch airstrikes against the Assad regime and that war powers must get more rigorous oversight and/or approval from Congress. A longtime anti-war activist, Sanders voted against the Iraq war resolution in 2002. He regularly called for the U.S. to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and Iraq. In both Afghanistan and Syria, Sanders has said that he believes the U.S. should remain involved, though with no ground troop presence. Sanders would end all U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, and was a main co-sponsor of the bipartisan bill passed by the Senate to force the Pentagon to end its involvement there. In a tweet, Sanders wrote that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman has murdered activists, heads a despotic regime and should be held accountable.

In 1983, as mayor of Burlington, he approved a resolution declaring “Gay Rights Day;” in 1993, he opposed the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy; and in 2000 he supported gay civil unions in Vermont. He opposes President Donald Trump’s push to ban transgender people from the military, and laws that would block transgender people from using the bathrooms of their choice. Foreign Policy: Use diplomacy to end Syrian conflict. Pull out troops, but in different way from Trump. Cut U.S. support in the conflict in Yemen, hold the Saudi crown prince “accountable” for crimes. Sanders would pull U.S. troops from Syria, but said he would do it in a different, less “erratic” way than Trump recently announced. He believes diplomacy with Russia and Iran can turn things around in Syria. He also believes the president did not have the right to launch airstrikes against the Assad regime and that war powers must get more rigorous oversight and/or approval from Congress. A longtime anti-war activist, Sanders voted against the Iraq war resolution in 2002. He regularly called for the U.S. to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and Iraq. In both Afghanistan and Syria, Sanders has said that he believes the U.S. should remain involved, though with no ground troop presence. Sanders would end all U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, and was a main co-sponsor of the bipartisan bill passed by the Senate to force the Pentagon to end its involvement there. In a tweet, Sanders wrote that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman has murdered activists, heads a despotic regime and should be held accountable.

He voted five times against the Brady Bill, which established background checks on firearm sales. He voted for an NRA-backed law that gave gunmakers sweeping immunity from legal action. He's voted to allow guns on Amtrak, planes and in national parks. With gun violence becoming a regular part of American life Bernie Sanders stood on the sidelines. That's why we need Mike Bloomberg who has shown time and time again he's not afraid of taking on the NRA,\" said Mike Bloomberg 2020 campaign manager Kevin Sheekey.\nThe campaign is releasing a new social media ad:\nThe campaign is launching a California bus tour beginning in Oakland tomorrow, February 25, to highlight the clear differences between Mike Bloomberg's record of standing up to the NRA and Senator Sanders' record of doing their bidding. Details to come.\nThe campaign is deploying surrogates to discuss Sander's record:\n\"I'm serving in the Colorado state legislature because I don't want another parent to ever experience the pain of losing a child to gun violence. And I'm proud to support Mike Bloomberg because he knows there are common-sense steps we can and must take to protect our kids and keep guns out of the wrong hands. But Bernie Sanders doesn't seem to understand just how important this issue is. He voted to allow guns on trains and planes and into national parks. Five times he voted against background checks on gun purchases. As president, Mike Bloomberg will support universal background checks, raise the age limit for gun sales, ban assault weapons, and hold the gunmakers accountable for their actions. That's the leadership we need in the White House.\" – CO State Representative and Gun Violence Survivor Tom Sullivan\n\"As Gary's mayor, I fought to hold gun manufacturers accountable in court for their negligence. Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, voted in the House to give these corporations immunity from lawsuits against them. He also opposed background checks for years, voting five times against the Brady Bill. Mike Bloomberg has never been afraid to take on the NRA. Mike is the leader we need in the White House to protect our children and communities from the daily epidemic of gun violence.\" – Former Mayor of Gary, Indiana Karen Freeman-Wilson\n\"It's high time people stopped entertaining the notion of electing a candidate like Bernie Sanders who sides with the gun industry instead of with the safety and security of Americans across the country who are fearful about the rise in gun violence. You simply cannot rely on someone who has voted against measures that would improve gun safety, shed light on the causes of gun violence, and ask manufacturers to shoulder some of the responsibility for the carnage, to do anything but take a back seat to this issue in Washington and watch it continue. That alarms me and it should alarm every voter who has an opportunity to make a different choice this year. It's why I'm voting for Mike Bloomberg and why I think anyone who cares about stopping the epidemic of gun violence in this country should too.\" – Founder of Harlem's Children Zone Geoffrey Canada\n\"Americans are dying in the streets. But Bernie got what he needed from the NRA and turned the other cheek. We know where he stands. He's a sellout to the corporate gun lobby. For all his talk about socialism, he's just another weak politician bowing to special interests. With 3 houses and a million dollars in the bank. Sanders accepted help from the NRA to run for Congress. He voted against the Brady Bill 5 times. He voted for an NRA-backed law giving corporate gun manufacturers immunity from legal action. In fact, the NRA called it 'the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in twenty years.' That's unacceptable. That's why I'm voting for Mike Bloomberg. He's been fighting the NRA for decades and he's winning. We need a leader in Washington who can think for himself. That's Mike.\" – Former Mayor of Philadelphia and Campaign National Political Co-Chair Michael Nutter\n\"As a gun violence survivor and advocate, it's baffling to me why anyone would consider Bernie Sanders a credible candidate in the race considering his abysmal record on gun safety. Every election calls for a leader who is suited to the times, and with so many shooting deaths, this is not the time to elect someone who has been in their pockets. This is not the time to elect someone who has voted against common sense background checks on firearms, or voted against holding gun corporations responsible for the damage their products do. It simply doesn't make sense, and it makes even less sense to elect a candidate like Bernie who is so completely unsuited to addressing one of the most alarming challenges we face. This crisis calls for a president like Mike Bloomberg who has as strong a record on gun safety as any American anywhere, and who has done more to create a grassroots movement to address gun safety than anyone else in the country. This is the president we need and this is the one I'm voting for because of it.\" – Campaign Senior Advisor and Gun Violence Survivor Debbie Weir\n\"Mike Bloomberg has spent decades getting guns off our streets, first as New York's mayor and then as the architect of the country's largest gun-safety movement. What has Bernie Sanders done? He voted five times against the Brady Bill, which mandated background checks for gun purchases. He voted to shield gun manufacturers from legal liability. He voted against funding CDC research into stopping gun violence. In 2020, we have the opportunity to elect a president who will finally make gun safety a top national priority. Mike Bloomberg, not Bernie Sanders, is the leader who will get it done.\" – U.S. Representative (NY-5) and Co Chair of Mike for Black America National Leadership Council Gregory Meeks\n\"Mike Bloomberg has been a longtime leader in the fight against the NRA. He knows words fail when trying to comfort a family grieving a loved one lost to gun violence. But collectively we can take action to stop the epidemic of gun violence. That's why we've passed new gun safety laws here in San Jose. We need to do more at the federal level, though. Bernie Sanders, unfortunately, has stood in the way of progress for years. He voted against the Brady Bill five times and to block funding anti-gun violence research. Democrats want a president who will stand up to the gun lobby and reduce senseless gun violence. They aren't 'feeling the Bern' — they know only Mike will get it done.\" – San Jose Mayor and California Campaign Co Chair Sam Liccardo\n\"We need to be real about how we stem the tide of guns. It will take an independent leader who isn't beholden to the NRA in order to pass common sense gun laws. Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill 5 times. The Brady Bill called for common sense gun laws. Most Americans support it. Most Americans don't support socialism and they don't support letting people die by gun violence. There's nothing from Sanders record that indicates he's going to do anything to make gun violence a priority. He's not fighting for urban Americans at all. It doesn't make sense to vote for him. The NRA helped Sanders get elected when he first ran for Congress and he's spent his career paying them back. People need to wake up and vote for someone who respects the Second Amendment, but who also respects our right to live. That's Mike Bloomberg. He doesn't owe anybody anything and he's clear about his position on guns. We need reform. Unlike bait and switch Bernie, Mike Bloomberg has the power to vote what he believes. And, that's for common sense gun laws.\" – Former Baltimore Mayor and Campaign National Political Co Chair Stephanie Rawlings Blake\n\"Bernie Sanders should be ashamed of himself. He's been supported by the NRA. They helped him get elected in his first run for Congress and he's been paying them back for years. He sold out when he did the NRA's bidding by voting against the Brady Bill 5 times. He was doing the NRA's bidding when he voted to ban funding for research into stopping gun violence at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). He was doing the NRA's bidding when he voted to allow guns on Amtrak trains, on planes and in national parks. Am I missing something? Does he just not care about people outside of rural Vermont? Urban gun violence has taken too many lives. And, most Americans live in our cities. We need a President who will fight the NRA, not a sellout like Sanders. If he's willing to roll over for the NRA, who else will he roll over for? He's not selling change. He's a full-fledged member of the swamp.\" – Former Miami Mayor and Campaign National Political Co Chair Manny Diaz\n\"While Americans die every day from gun violence, Bernie Sanders talks a big game about being independent and kicking special interests to the curb. But, let's be honest, he's voted five times against the Brady Bill. We need a proven fighter for gun safety. Mike Bloomberg has taken on the NRA and beat them, fighting for common sense gun reform for decades – changing laws, saving lives, starting Moms Demand Action, and Everytown for Gun Safety, while still respecting the Second Amendment. Mike's record is clear – he will continue to fight for and deliver on the common sense gun reform that Democrats, and most all of America, demands.\" – Mayor of Louisville and Campaign Co Chair Greg Fischer\n\"Bernie Sanders says he wants to take on the powerful corporate lobbies that run Washington. But the truth is that he's rolled over for the NRA time and again. They spent thousands of dollars helping elect him to Congress and he's been paying them back ever since. That's why Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill — 5 times. It's inexcusable. Most Americans support common sense background checks on firearm sales and we can't afford someone in the White House who had an election year conversion on the importance of gun safety legislation.\" – U.S. Representative (FL-7) and Campaign Co Chair Stephanie Murphy\n—\nBACKGROUND ON SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEO\nNRA Executive Wayne LaPierre: \"Bernie Sanders Is A More Honorable Choice For Vermont Sportsmen Than Peter Smith.\" \"A few days before Election Day in 1990, the National Rifle Association sent a letter to its 12,000 members in Vermont, with an urgent message about the race for the state's single House seat. Vote for the socialist, the gun rights group said. It's important. 'Bernie Sanders is a more honorable choice for Vermont sportsmen than Peter Smith,' wrote Wayne LaPierre, who was — and still is — a top official at the national NRA, backing Sanders over the Republican incumbent.\" [Washington Post, 5/19/15]\nThe NRA Spent $18,000 Attacking Sanders' Opponent. \"The Clinton campaign also noted that the NRA helped elect Sanders to the House of Representatives in 1990. [...] The NRA backed Republican incumbent Peter Smith in his 1988 race against Sanders. But Smith didn't stick to his guns and came out in favor of an assault weapons ban after he won. Feeling betrayed, the gun group spent $18,000 attacking the incumbent in 1990 and issued bumper stickers emblazoned with images of Smith as Pinocchio and 'Dump Pete Smith,' Garrison Nelson, a professor of state politics at the University of Vermont previously told PolitiFact.\" [PolitiFact, 4/15/16]\nRepublican Opponent Co-Sponsored A Bill Banning The Sale Of Assault Weapons. \"Smith found a bill to ban the sale of some assault weapons. He signed on as co-sponsor. That was April 1989. Almost immediately, Smith's office was flooded with angry cards, petitions, faxes and letters.\" [Washington Post, 7/19/15]\nBetween 1991 And 1993, Sanders Voted Against The Brady Bill Five Times. \"The Brady bill imposed a five-day waiting period for would-be purchasers of handguns.

Sanders, an independent from rural and gun-friendly Vermont, defended the virtues of moderation on this issue — arguing, 'We need a sensible debate about gun control which overcomes the cultural divide that exists in this country, and I think I can play an important role in this.'\" [Vox, 3/04/19]\n2007: Sanders Voted To \"Block Funding To Any Foreign Aid Organization That Registered Or Taxes American's Guns.\" \"As a senator, Sanders supported bills to allow firearms in checked bags on Amtrak trains and block funding to any foreign aid organization that registered or taxed Americans' guns.\" [Slate, 5/6/15]\n2009: Sanders Voted To Allow Guns On Amtrak Trains. \"In addition to Sanders' Brady Bill votes, the Clinton campaign referred us to Sanders' votes against funding for gun research, twice for prohibiting lawsuits against firearms manufacturers ('what the head of the NRA called the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in the last 20 years,' said Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin), for increasing the burden of proof to prosecute law-breaking gun dealers, and for allowing firearms on Amtrak trains and in national parks.\" [PolitiFact, 4/15/16]\nMichael Bloomberg, Bloomberg Campaign Press Release - Mike Bloomberg 2020 Campaign Highlights Bernie Sanders' Dangerous Record Fighting Against Gun Safety Legislation Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/365794\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Fact check: Hillary Clinton's claims about Bernie Sanders' gun record\nWith only two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Hillary Clinton once again went on the offensive at Sunday night's Democratic debate over Sen. Bernie Sanders' record on gun issues. At this debate, she listed a series of previous votes cast by the independent senator from Vermont that were viewed as unfavorable to gun control activists.\n\"He has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous times,\" Clinton said on stage in Charleston, South Carolina.\nClinton, who urged Sanders on CBS's Face the Nation to \"flip-flop\" more so his positions on guns would be closer to hers, said Sanders voted five times against the Brady Bill, which ultimately required a five-day waiting period and created an instant background check system for handgun buyers in the 1990s.\nThe Brady Bill had come up in Congress numerous times since 1987 and Sanders did, in fact, vote against different versions of it five times. A few months after Sanders came to Capitol Hill in 1991 as a member in the House, he voted against a version of the Brady Bill that would have required a waiting period of at least seven days. Sanders later voted against a version modified by the Senate that would have decreased the waiting period to five days.\nIn 1993, the Brady Bill was reintroduced with a five-day waiting period. Sanders voted against that version, but voted in favor of an amendment backed by the NRA to create instant criminal background checks. That year, Sanders also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods and in favor of an amendment to give people who are denied a gun the right to know why, according to Politifact. At the end of November that year, Congress passed the final bicameral compromise that required a five-day waiting period and instant criminal background check system.\nSanders opposed the final version. Jeff Weaver, his current campaign manager, told Politifact last summer that Sanders voted against the measure because he believed the waiting period was a federal overreach.\nClinton also claimed that Sanders voted for the \"Charleston loophole.\" The loophole refers to the Charleston massacre last June in which Dylan Roof shot and killed nine people in a historic black church. The FBI performs background checks on gun buyers in South Carolina and if the check isn't denied or completed in three days, the gun seller can sell the guy to the prospective buyer, according to The Washington Post. Due to a clerical error, this is how Roof obtained a gun even though he shouldn't have been able to. Gun advocates say the elimination of the loophole would have prevented Roof from getting the gun. The three-day waiting period resulted from a provision in the Brady Bill.\nClinton also said Sanders voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers. In 2005, Sanders voted for a bill that shielded gun manufacturers and sellers from lawsuits connected to damage caused by guns they sell or make. After increasing pressure from the Clinton campaign, Sanders announced Saturday that would support a new bill that would reverse that legal immunity.\n\"He voted to let guns go onto the Amtrak, guns go into National Parks. He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives,\" Clinton added during Sunday's debate.\nIn 2009, Sanders voted to allow Amtrak passengers to store firearms in their checked luggage. President Obama eventually signed this provision into law in a separate bill. That year, Sanders also voted for a bill to allow licensed gun owners to bring firearms into national parks. President Obama eventually signed that bill into law, too.\nIn 1996, Sanders did vote against an amendment when he served in the House that would have restored funding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for gun violence research. That year, Republicans successfully included language restricting the CDC from conducting that research. That ban has remained in place ever since, though Sanders called in December for it to be stripped.\nFor his part, Sanders argued Sunday that he has a D- rating from the NRA, supported the assault weapons ban as far back as his 1988 run for Congress and supported an instant background check from \"day one.\"\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Some of the debt increase was already projected to occur before anything was signed by Obama. Moreover, spending and tax decisions are primarily the responsibility of Congress – at least officially – and often end up being the result of actions (or inactions) agreed upon by both Congress and the president.\nBy Most Measures, Debt Roughly Doubled Under Obama\nFrom a numerical standpoint, Trump is correct that the debt has almost doubled in dollar terms since Obama's first inauguration. Using the gross debt figure Trump cites, debt grew from $10.6 trillion on Inauguration Day 2009 to $19.4 trillion as of July 21. Using the more economically meaningful figure of debt held by the public, which excludes money that the government owes to itself, debt more than doubled from $6.3 trillion to $14 trillion.\nHowever, measuring debt in dollars fails to account for inflation or the fact that the economy and population are larger in 2016 than they were in 2008. Measured as a share of the economy, the debt nearly doubled from 39.4 percent at the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 (four months before Obama took office) to 75.4 percent projected at the end of FY 2016 (two months from now). Gross debt increased by less than half from 70.2 percent at the end of FY 2008 to 104.2 percent projected at the end of FY 2016.\nIt's Unfair to Attribute Debt Increase Entirely to Obama\nWhile by many measures debt has doubled under Obama’s presidency, it is hard to argue this is entirely of Obama’s doing.\nFirst of all, much of the debt increase was the result of laws and economic conditions in place before Obama took office rather than laws that passed under his presidency. The Congressional Budget Office’s first current law projections of the Obama presidency already projected debt held by the public would rise from $5.8 trillion to $9.1 trillion when Obama left office – and these projections didn’t incorporate the entire depth of the Great Recession, which reduced revenue and therefore further increased debt.\nImportantly, though, President Obama did sign many laws worsening this debt situation. Among the most significant are the 2009 stimulus, extending the 2001/2003 tax cuts temporarily in 2010 and making most of them permanent in 2012, the 2015 permanent \"doc fix,\" and the tax extenders/omnibus bill at the end of 2015. President Obama also signed several pieces of legislation to reduce projected debt, most significantly the Budget Control Act. But importantly, these laws were written not by the president but by Congress.\nIt is Congress that passes tax and spending legislation. There is little the president can do to impact the debt, positively or negatively, without a bill passed by Congress. Conversly there is little Congress can do without the president's signature or a veto-proof supermajority. Further, during most of Obama's term to date, control of Congress was split between a Democratic Senate and a Republican House. Both branches share blame, both for legislation that increased the debt and for failing to enact legislation that would curb the debt growth that was already projected to occur from the growth of entitlement programs and insufficient revenues.\n***\nBy a few metrics, debt has doubled during the Obama presidency. The blame though is not only on him because some of the debt increase over the past eight years was already expected to occur, and Congress had to approve bills that increased the debt. Interestingly, debt held by the public would double again by 2024 under Trump's proposed plans – so while he is right about what's happened under President Obama's watch, his plan will make the problem worse.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Sessions: Obama is the ‘$20 Trillion Man’\nWASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Congressman Pete Sessions (R-TX), chairman of the House Rules Committee, today issued the following statement after voting in favor of legislation that would require the current administration to appear before the Congress prior to each and every potential debt limit increase:\n“As his administration comes to a close, there’s one legacy that Barack Obama is not talking about, and that’s the fact that he is the $20 trillion man. In just seven short years, our national debt has nearly doubled from just over $10 trillion when Obama took office, to nearly $20 trillion today. This is not only unfair to future generations of Americans, it’s immoral. That’s why I was pleased today to support a bill that would require a member of the current administration to come before the Congress prior to each and every potential debt limit increase to provide testimony and detailed reports on the drivers of our national debt, progress on debt reduction as well as new proposals to reduce the debt. While House Republicans have passed balanced budget after balanced budget, this president continues to propose budgets that never balance. This is not Monopoly money – these are hard earned tax dollars from average Americans, and they are who we should consider when discussing whether to raise our debt limit yet again. This bill allows us to better our communication between the branches of government and make smart choices to reduce our debt.”\nFor more on H.R. 3442, the Debt Management and Fiscal Responsibility Act, click here.\n###\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        In a news interview and a speech in Pennsylvania, President Donald Trump misleadingly suggested that rising stock value could reduce the national debt. One budget expert told us that notion was “just silly.”\nIn an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News, Trump noted that the country’s debt rose by $10 trillion under President Barack Obama and that since he took office, stock values have increased by $5.2 trillion. So, he said, “maybe in a sense we’re reducing debt.”\nTrump on Fox News, Oct. 11: The country — we took it over and owed over 20 trillion. As you know the last eight years, they borrowed more than it did in the whole history of our country. So they borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet, we picked up 5.2 trillion just in the stock market. Possibly picked up the whole thing in terms of the first nine months, in terms of value. So you could say, in one sense, we’re really increasing values. And maybe in a sense we’re reducing debt. But we’re very honored by it. And we’re very, very happy with what’s happening on Wall Street.\nTrump made similar comments during a speech on tax reform in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that same day.\nTrump in Harrisburg, Oct. 11: And very proudly, just in the stock market alone, we have increased our economic worth by $5.2 trillion dollars. That’s right since Election Day — $5.2 trillion.\nThink about that. That’s a quarter of the $20 trillion that we owe. So we’ve already — but listen to this because we’ve doubled — in the last eight years of the previous administration, the debt doubled, so that in eight years our debt — literally hundreds of years of debt — doubled in eight years to $20 trillion.\nBut since the election on November 8th, I’ve increased the value of your U.S. assets by more than the $20 trillion that we currently owe. You haven’t heard those numbers.\nTrump is right that the federal debt increased under Obama.\nTotal public debt outstanding rose from $10.6 trillion to $19.9 trillion, an increase of $9.3 trillion. That includes all the money that the government owes to itself, including the Social Security trust funds. Under Obama, the federal debt held by the public grew from $6.3 trillion to $14.4 trillion, an $8.1 trillion increase, or a little more than 128 percent over Obama’s eight years.\nThe debt continues to rise under Trump. The debt held by the public is now at $14.7 trillion, and the total debt is at $20.4 trillion.\nIt’s also true that the stock market has been making steady gains.\nSince Trump took office, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 15.9 percent to 22,872 at the close on Oct. 11. Trump takes credit for the rise in the stock market dating back to his election last November — and an argument can be made for a “Trump Rally” that many attribute at least partly to investor optimism that the president-elect would, once in office, cut taxes and regulation as promised. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock average rose nearly 6 percent between Election Day and Obama’s last day in office.\nThe White House said Trump arrived at the $5.2 trillion figure by looking at the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index. (A single point in the Wilshire 5000 represents about $1.15 billion in index market value, and the Wilshire index grew by 4,439 between Nov. 8, 2016, and Oct. 12. That translates to $5.1 trillion growth in market value since Election Day.)\nBut Trump’s suggestion that stock value somehow reduces the national debt is misleading.\n“It’s nonsense,” Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Government, told us.\n“There is no relationship between the national debt and the value of the stock market, which is the total value of a selection of stocks owned by individuals and being held abroad,” Goldwein said. “It’s just silly. They are totally different economic indicators.”\nThose sentiments were echoed by political economist Greg Valliere of Horizon Investments to CNNMoney.\n“The stock market’s gains have virtually nothing to do with the size of the national debt, which continues to rise because government spending far exceeds government receipts,” Valliere said. “A higher stock market encourages consumers and companies to spend more, which helps the overall economy. But it’s absurd to contend that the national debt has fallen because of this.”\nIndeed, if Trump’s premise were accurate, the debt would have fallen significantly under Obama — because the rise in stock market value didn’t start with Trump’s election.\nThe S&P 500 index more than doubled — rising by 166 percent — under Obama. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 138 percent. And yet, as we said earlier, debt soared under Obama.\nThe White House referred us to an Oct. 12 interview that White House Legislative Director Marc Short gave to CNN’s Wolf Blitzer.\nShort was asked whether a booming stock market would reduce the national debt, as the president suggested. He said it would, because a “booming stock market means that people are continuing to pay more taxes and dividends, so there are additional resources coming in to the Treasury.”\nShort added that the country needs to “address its spending habit” but that “the booming stock market does help generate more revenue that can help pay down the debt.”\nHigh stock values can be an indicator of faster economic growth, Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget told us, but not always.\nAnd higher stock value should translate to moderately higher revenues from capital gains taxes and retirement account withdrawals, he said, but those increased revenues would never be equivalent to the debt. For starters, only 20 to 25 cents of every dollar from capital gains is taxed, Goldwein said. And, it is only taxed when the stocks are sold, not when they are held. So the amount of tax revenue the government gets from that is a tiny fraction of the overall value of stocks.\nIn its own fact-check of Trump’s comments, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget notes: “Last year, capital gains taxes accounted for only 4 percent of total federal revenue – even a record jump in capital gains next year would only reduce further borrowing by about $50 billion, which is less than a tenth of what we are projected to borrow next year.”\nAnd, Goldwein said, those increased revenues are already accounted for in the Congressional Budget Office’s deficit projections.\nThe CBO reported that the federal government ran a budget deficit of $668 billion in fiscal year 2017, which ended Sept. 30. That was about $25 billion less than the CBO projected in June, “largely because outlays were less than CBO anticipated.”\nA CBO analysis of Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2018 estimated that while Trump proposed significant spending cuts, the cumulative deficit over the 2018 to 2027 period would total $6.8 trillion (even as the deficits would decline as a percentage of GDP from 3.6 percent in 2017 to 2.6 percent at the end of the period).\nIn other words, the debt under Trump’s proposed budget would not be as high as projected under current law, but it would still grow. (We should note that Congress has not yet passed a spending plan for fiscal 2018.)\nThat Trump budget plan includes $1.9 trillion less in spending on health care in anticipation of a repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act — which hasn’t happened yet.\nThe president’s budget also assumes deficit neutral tax reform, which the Trump administration and Republican leaders are not proposing. An analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, for example, concluded the latest iteration of the tax plan would add $2.2 trillion to the debt.\nWhite House budget chief Mick Mulvaney told CNN, “If we simply look at this as being deficit-neutral [tax plan], you’re never going to get the type of tax reform and tax reductions that you need to get to sustain 3 percent economic growth.”\nTrump is right that the stock market has been soaring — a trend that began several years ago, but that has been even more pronounced since Trump’s election. But those stock gains are not reducing the ever-growing national debt. At best, the additional tax revenues may contribute to slowing the debt’s growth.\n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Additionally, sophomore and junior transfer candidates are eligible to apply for the January admission deadline. Please contact transfer@bc.edu for more information.\nIn recent years, a small number of Boston College applicants have faced challenges in meeting our application deadlines through no fault of their own. Natural disasters, political unrest, local school strikes and other unexpected events can add a level of complexity to the college application process. To the extent possible, Boston College is committed to working with students or those writing recommendations to extend deadlines, if necessary. Impacted students should contact us directly to discuss their circumstances.\nBoston College's transfer credit policies are established by the deans and faculty of each undergraduate division. Course evaluations are completed by the Office of Transfer Admission. In order for courses to be accepted, they must be equal in depth and breadth to courses taught at BC, and a grade of C- or better must be achieved. Course descriptions for all Boston College courses and information on requirements according to academic division can be found in the University Catalog.\nThe maximum number of transferable credits is 60 credits. All transfer students must enroll as full time students and spend a minimum of four semesters at Boston College to earn a degree. If you are interested in part-time studies, please visit the Woods College of Advancing Studies for more information.\nProspective students often call asking two important questions. First, which courses they should be taking at their current institutions to increase their chances of acceptance to Boston College? And second, which courses would most likely be accepted for credit should they be admitted and choose to enroll at Boston College?\nAppropriate course selection is one of the most important factors in presenting a strong transfer application.

Selectivity does vary a bit by semester because transfer enrollment figures depend on how many openings there are at the University, which can fluctuate from one semester to the next.\nHow many students apply for admission?\nWe generally have about 1,700 applicants for September and 400 for January.\nIf I applied as a freshman and was not accepted, should I apply?\nAs in freshman admission, the transfer admission process is highly selective. Students most successful in our transfer process will be competitive out of high school and have strong college records. Although students are welcome to re-apply, please be aware of the selectivity of our process.\nI am in my first semester of college, may I apply?\nTypically, the earliest students may apply to transfer is during their second semester of college. Our rationale is that we will not have an official college transcript with final semester grades to evaluate by the November 1st application deadline.\nAn exception to this policy will be made for students who were admitted as a freshman applicant yet chose to attend another institution. If you were offered admission in high school and wish to seek spring transfer enrollment, please contact our office.\nI'm an international applicant. Do I need to submit both the SAT and the English proficiency? Students whose first language is not English must have a current TOEFL IELTS, or DET score (within the last two years) and either the SAT or the ACT in order to apply. This applies to all international students, even those who attend schools where the primary language of instruction is English. The only way the TOEFL requirement will be waived is if the student scores 650 or above on the SAT EBRW or a 29 or above on the ACT English. If you attended a U.S. high school for at least three years and you are enrolled in a traditional university curriculum without ESOL coursework, an English proficiency exam is not required. If you feel further evidence of your English skills will enhance your application, you are still welcome to send those test scores.\nIs it easier to be admitted to one major over another?\nStudents must apply to one of the four academic divisions at Boston College (the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences, the Carroll School of Management, the Connell School of Nursing or the Lynch School of Education) and selectivity is very similar across the divisions. We aim to enroll transfer students in numbers proportionate to undergraduate division size at the University. In other words, Morrissey, as the largest division, typically has the most spaces available to add new transfers followed by the Carroll School of Management, the Lynch School of Education and Human Development, and the Connell School of Nursing. Please be advised that transferring into the Carroll School of Management once enrolled at Boston College is not allowed. The only way to enroll in the Carroll School of Management is to apply directly.\nCan I reactivate my application from a previous admission cycle?\nNo. If you wish to re-apply to Boston College, you must submit all new documents and a new application fee.\nIf I apply as a transfer candidate and do not get in can I reapply in the future?\nWe recommend that a student wait one full year before reapplying, so that they have time to improve their academic record in order to have the best chance of being admitted should they attempt to apply again. Please note: We do not hold or store past applications; therefore, students reapplying must submit all new documents and another application fee.\nWill I get housing as a transfer student?\nAll transfer students are awarded two years of guaranteed on-campus housing as part of their acceptance.\nWill applying for on campus housing hurt my chances of admission?\nNo. Students should apply for housing if they wish to live on campus. Your housing request in no way impacts our admission decision. For more information on the Office of Residential Life, click here.\n**Please note that due to current enrollment trends, we are not accepting transfer applications to the Connell School of Nursing for Fall 2026 entry. Please contact the Office of Undergraduate Admission at transfer@bc.edu if you have any questions.**\nWhat kind of undergraduate nursing program does Boston College offer?\nBoston College offers a Bachelor of Science (nursing) at the undergraduate level through the Connell School of Nursing.\nAm I able to attend the undergraduate Bachelor of Science (nursing) part-time?\nNo, the Bachelor of Science (nursing) program is only offered for full-time day students.\nDoes BC offer a RN to Bachelor of Science (nursing) program at the undergraduate level?\nNo, there is no formal RN to Bachelor of Science (nursing) program. However, students with an RN may apply as transfer students.\nDo you allow nursing transfer students?\nYes.

From Montana to Michigan, from septic systems to center-pivots, we wage war over waterits cleanliness, its availability, its highest use, its commodification, its spiritual essence. And as history proceeds from the settling of the prairies to the sprawling of suburbs, the struggles are becoming increasingly intense.\n- Montana farmers and environmentalists, for example, have sued a methane mining company for pumping millions of gallons of water into local rivers, damaging crops with \"industrial waste.\" A federal court agreed with the farmers. The mining company is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. Elsewhere in the state, irrigators skirmish with towns and anglers over scarce water supplies and \"dewatered\" streams.\n- In South Dakota, authorities are building massive pipelinesfinanced mostly with federal grantsto solve drinking water problems. But taxpayer watchdogs have attacked the projects' funding, saying it's an enormous subsidy to citizens who should be paying their own way.\n- In North Dakota, midstate farmers and eastern towns hope to pipe Missouri River water across the state, viewing the so-called Garrison Diversion as the savior of the heartland. Others claim it would be an environmental tragedy and the biggest water boondoggle in state history.\n- Fearing that high-capacity wells are draining public aquifers for private gain, some Wisconsin policymakers want to regulate such wells throughout the state. Other officials are worried about runoff from farmers' fields and private septic systems that contaminates rivers and lakes.\n- To improve water quality, Minnesota legislators this spring considered a prohibition on phosphorus in dishwasher detergent, but critics attacked the measure as expensive, unnecessary interference with commerce. Meanwhile, officials note that the proportion of Minnesota lakes considered fit for swimming declined from 79 percent to 64 percent between 1994 and 2000. In late June, the governor announced a clean water initiative; agency officials estimated a $3 billion price tag for water cleanup.\n- Drought and fear of global warming have raised water worries even among Great Lakes states like Michigan, where schemes to ship fresh water from lakes to other nations or Sun Belt states have citizens in Michiganthe Upper Peninsula (U.P.) includeddecrying a \"liquid gold rush.\" But Michigan offered $9.6 million in subsidies to attract a Perrier Group project to pump 200 gallons a minute for its bottled water.\nThese battles are not exclusive to the Ninth District, of course. Water wars were a key item at last year's Environmental Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa. In Oregon's Klamath River Basin, farmers fight with environmentalists over whether to use river water to irrigate crops or spawn fish. California and Colorado regularly feud over water supplies. And the U.S. Supreme Court has just agreed to rule on a centuries-old dispute between Virginia and Maryland over rights to Potomac River water.\nWhat all these disputes share is intense competition over a vital resource: water, the lifeblood of humanity. And from an economist's perspective, the difficulty of resolving the disputes lies not in simply reconciling supply and demand, but rather in the fact that water has a remarkably complex economic personality that renders it vulnerable to both market and government failure. In a nutshell, the provision and use of water are prone to what economists call externalities, decreasing costs and problematic public goods valuation.\nThese economic characteristicsand entrenched political realitiesmean that there are no easy answers to the allocative problems that water presents. A durable resolution will involve elements of both market forces and government intervention, but the right combination has remained elusive. The bottom line is that water will never meet an economist's definition of a simple market commodity or an obvious government serviceso water solutions will always be difficult to grasp. But because water will always be a critical need, we'll continue to struggle to find the right blend.\nGo wet, young man\nGovernment has historically played a major role in the provision of water for agriculture and home use. The aqueducts of ancient Rome, for instance, were the quintessential symbol of the empire's geographic reach and economic power. In the United States, government water supply has been the foundation of national growth. Teddy Roosevelt's Reclamation Act of 1902 launched the building of major dams and irrigation systems throughout the western United States, under the aegis of the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), with the goal of settling the West.\nOne of the BOR's first damsthe largest earth dam in the world upon its completion in 1914was the Belle Fourche Dam in western South Dakota. Built to \"reclaim\" arid land, the dam soon filled the irrigation ditches of Butte County farmers, and today the county, with about 1 percent of the state's population, accounts for 25 percent of the state's annual water withdrawals. (Butte County farmers irrigate to grow alfalfa and corn on 57,000 acres; they sign 25-year contracts at a flat fee per acre to cover maintenance and operation costs. So the price they pay for water has only a minor relationship to quantity of water used.)\nIrrigation is the primary focus of BOR projects, and in terms of the total quantity of water withdrawn and consumed from surface and ground water sources, it is the major water use in Ninth District states. (Coal and nuclear power plants also withdraw huge quantities of water for cooling, but about 98 percent of it is returned immediately for other uses; irrigation, in contrast, consumes most of the water it withdraws.) (See chart.)\nIn Montana, 97 percent of all water withdrawn from rivers, lakes and aquifers in 2000 was used for irrigation, according to provisional data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), which compiles water data every five years. The figures for South Dakota and North Dakota are nearly as high: 71 percent and 61 percent, respectively.\nIrrigation pulls a lot of water: Montana used about 8 billion gallons of water a day for irrigation in 2000, twice as much water as Minnesota used for all purposes. On a per capita basis, the contrast is even more dramatic: Montana used nearly 12 times as much water per capita as Minnesota, according to the USGS's provisional 2000 data. In the United States as a whole, in 1995, irrigation and livestock accounted for 85 percent of the nation's annual withdrawals of water.\nPublic supply and public decay\nThe BOR's powerful role in irrigation belies the picture of rugged individualism espoused by Roosevelt, but irrigation is only one type of water use supported by government. Water for domestic, commercial and industrial uses is also often supplied publiclytwo-thirds of Wisconsin's population, for example, was served by public systems in 2000. And in district states, the trend toward public supply is rising. In South Dakota, for example, 75,000 more people got their water from public supply systems in 2000 than in 1990, according to the latest USGS report on water use in South Dakota. The state's total population increased 8.5 percent over the decade, but the proportion supplied with public water increased faster, by 13.6 percent. \"The increase,\" said the report, \"can be attributed to the continued increase in the number of rural customers and towns served by rural water systems and the migration of people to cities.\"\nBut while government-run water systems are ubiquitous, they also suffer several fundamental flaws.\nUnder pressure to make water available at the lowest possible cost, government water systems tend not to account for the true capital depreciation costs of their systems (let alone for the actual opportunity cost or scarcity value of water). As a result, most public water systems are in advanced states of decay. Recent analyses by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency project that over the next two decades, communities will have to spend as much as $1 trillion to repair or replace drinking water and wastewater facilities. The EPA further estimates a $650 billion gap between current spending plans and needed funding for water system repair over the next 15 years.\nIn the U.P., for instance, the crumbling water systems of Ontonagon village, White Pine and Silver City were unable to meet the demands of residents, who petitioned for federal funds to rebuild and extend their systems. Their congressman, Rep. Bart Stupak of Menominee, brought home the pork: $15 million in federal loans and grants. \"In addition to assuring residents ... a safe, quality water supply,\" declared Stupak, \"this water project will help make this area more attractive for business development.\"\nOther Michigan townships and villages in Baraga, Gogebic, Houghton, Marquette and Ontonagon counties received $14.8 million in federal grants last year to repair and upgrade their water and sewer systems.\nPolitical connections\nGovernment-run water systems also are highly susceptible to political favoritism. Of course, political favors can be viewed as the natural outcome of the democratic process, but by the same token, such favors will remain controversial as other interest groups express their concerns.\nIn North Dakota, for instance, agricultural interests worked for decades to get federal funding for an irrigation system that would bring Missouri River water east. The original plan called for irrigating more than 1 million acres. National sentiment for big new irrigation schemes has dried up since this plan was first devised, but advocates of the Garrison Diversion Project, as it has long been known, came up with a revised project focused on drinking water for towns to the east. Critics continue to call Garrison \"the granddaddy of wasteful water projects,\" and former assistant Secretary of the Interior Nathaniel Reed said the revised project \"won't solve North Dakota's water problems and is returning Garrison to its well-earned reputation as a first-class boondoggle.\" The dispute, born in the 1940s, is unlikely to be resolved any time soon.\nIn South Dakota, Montana and southwestern Minnesota, local communities are counting on roughly $1.5 billion in federal dollars to build vast new drinking water systems. The Fort Peck Reservation system, for example, would cost $200 million and pull water from the Missouri to supply 31,000 people and 120,000 head of livestock in four northeastern Montana counties. The Rocky Boy's-North Central Montana Regional Water System would cost about $229 million and serve water from Lake Elwell to 7,000 homes in 20 communities.\nStill larger projects in South Dakotathe Mni Wiconi, the Mid Dakota and the Lewis & Clarkare planned or under way, but their completion is threatened by federal budget cutbacks. President Bush's 2004 budget included far less than state officials hoped for in annual appropriations for the South Dakota projects: Indeed, the Lewis & Clark project, which would bring Missouri River water to about 200,000 people, including much of Sioux Falls, received nothing in the Bush budget.\nThe importance of systems to provide clean water is undeniable. Those that would bring water to American Indian populations are especially critical. On the Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservationsjust a few counties south of South Dakota's well-watered Butte Countyground water wells provide too little water, according to public health officials, and what they do offer is often contaminated with arsenic, hydrocarbons or nitrates. Many residents rely on \"water buffalos\"large tank trucksto deliver water a few times a week.\nBut if the need is clear, the financing is questionable. The Mni Wiconi is a 4,500-mile pipeline project with 35 reservoirs that will serve more than 50,000 people in seven counties and three reservations. But it has experienced approximately $70 million in cost overruns on a $392.4 million project, according to audits by the Department of the Interior's Office of Inspector General. Possible mismanagement aside, critics say that federal underwriting for big drinking water projects obscures reality and avoids tough decisions.\n\"Very few of these are really just about drinking water, but drinking water is what will sell something,\" said Steve Ellis, vice president for programs at Taxpayers for Common Sense. Ellis argues that many of these projects are actually pushed by farmers who want to tap into the drinking water projects. \"The irrigation beneficiaries will just tie onto the system,\" he said. \"Getting the water to the irrigation folks is the main driver, but in some cases the [Indian] reservation is being used as political cover, as the justification.\"\nBuy me a drink?\nEven if the projects are just about drinking wateras their advocates insistgroups like Ellis' argue that local communities need to be more responsible for their own water costs. Under BOR rules, federal funding covers 100 percent of the cost for water supply projects to Indian reservations, and 80 percent for the non-Indian portion.\nThat cost-share funding is essential, according to Annemarie Robinson. Robinson is coordinator of the local administrative authority for the Rocky Boy's-North Central Montana Regional Water System. Would the local communities build the system without the federal subsidy? \"No, never happen. Never in a million years,\" said Robinson. \"It's just too expensive.\"\nAccording to Robinson, the $229 million project would serve about 19,000 peoplenearly seven times the per capita cost of the Lewis & Clark water system that would serve an area with greater population density. Planners suggest that the per capita costs will drop, since a new water system should help the area's population grow to about 30,000 after 50 years.\nWithout the project, predicts Robinson, things will go in the other direction. Boosting rates to cover the cost of water system improvements would cause an exodus. \"We'll price ourselves out of water,\" she said. \"When people start looking at $100 monthly bills for water, they're going to move out of there.\" Robinson acknowledges that the harsh climate already dissuades many from living in north central Montana, but she's committed to fighting \"the battle of the funding\" for the water project. \"A lot of people choose not to live up here because of the weather,\" she said. \"But us die-hards, we love it up here.\"\nFor Ellis, that's the problem. Why should the federal government subsidize a lifestyle choice? \"If there's anything that should be paid for by the users, it's drinking water,\" he said. \"If we're spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a very few people, we have to ask some really hard questions about whether this is really something that we should do.\"\nBattle of the Missouri\nThe Missouri Riverwhose flow through Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and then south to Missouri, is managed by the Army Corps of Engineers through an extensive system of dams, reservoirs and leveeshas also been involved in a long-standing upriver/downriver dispute. The northern states of the Ninth District rely on its waters for recreation, but southern states like Missouri want the river's water managed for flood control and barge transit. Upriver states have pressured the corps to use its dams to mimic natural ebb and flow cycles that would aid the fish and wildlife that bring in tourism dollars. But downstream states want steady water flow. Senators from the various states have been fighting this river battle in Congress for a decade, and the corps has maintained the status quo, to no one's satisfaction.\nSen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota says the economics are simple: A thriving $100 million recreation business should trump a dying $7 million barge industry. Many would dispute Daschle's calculations, but his underlying argument makes sense: The Missouri's waters should be managed so as to optimize its value, balancing costs against benefits to arrive at the highest net benefit to the nation as a whole. But with government-run water systems, it's clear that regional politicsnot national economicsare usually in charge.\nThe Missouri River battle and others in the Ninth District highlight the fact that market signals play a weak role in water allocation decisions. The inevitable consequence is waste, scarcity and disputes.\nMarkets to the rescue\nIn the face of growing problems with government-run water systems, markets are increasingly promoted as the solution. \"Water is a commodity like any other,\" states the Political Economy Research Center (PERC), an environmental think tank based in Bozeman, Mont. \"Water crises need not occur if individuals are allowed to respond to scarcity through market processes.\"\nThe problem, wrote Clay Landry and Terry Anderson of PERC, is that \"prices and allocation have been determined in the political arena [where] powerful interest groups have prevented any meaningful increases in water prices or reallocations.\" Markets, they argue, should bring the Invisible Hand to the clear liquid. \"With the high cost of development limiting expansion of water supply, the growing demand for water will be kept in check by higher prices, and supplies to meet the demand will have to come from reallocating water from current uses.\"\nIn Minnesota, a February 2003 report from the Environmental Quality Board suggested that the demand for water should, indeed, be more dependent on the willingness to pay. \"Minnesota, like most states, treats its water like a free good,\" said the report. \"People tend to waste a good that costs them nothing. ... The state could send a message to all Minnesotans by establishing a value-based fee on uses such as permitted water appropriations, drinking water connections and wastewater and septic system discharges.\"\nFederal officials, too, have called for greater reliance on water markets. In 1996, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt suggested that \"willing buyer/willing seller\" water markets would help ease water battles in the West. And in a May 2003 report, the current Interior Secretary, Gale Norton, emphasized that \"market-based transfers\" are one part of the solution to the West's water woes.\n\"The Department of the Interior strongly supports the use of these mechanisms to allow water to be shifted between competing water uses,\" says the report, ominously titled Water 2025: Preventing Crises and Conflict in the West. Notably, the report admits that \"the use of water banks and markets is sometimes a source of concern to agricultural areas and the communities that support them.\"\nMarket limitations\nThe argument for water markets has great merit. Water would be allocated more efficiently and wasted less if its allocation could be based on clear prices established by demand and supply. But the argument is also a bit too simplistic. Water is not a commodity like any other. Rather, it is inherently susceptible to market failurethat is, unfettered markets often will fail to allocate it optimally.\n\"Unfortunately,\" argued William Easter, an economist at the University of Minnesota, \"water has a number of characteristics which create market failure in its production and delivery to users.\" Easter, a World Bank consultant and international authority on the economics of water management, observes that these market failurescombined with the ideas that people have a basic right to receive water and that water projects induce economic developmenthave often impelled governments to intervene heavily in the provision of water. While government involvement itself leads to problems, a naive application of market theory to water supply and demand won't resolve the complexities of water allocationand could make them worsewithout an understanding of the market failures to which water is susceptible. The heart of the problem lies in the economic character of water.\nThe collection, treatment, delivery and use of water are inherently prone toin an economist's terminologydecreasing costs, externalities and challenging public goods valuation. And each of these characteristics leads to pricing problems that marketsabsent some level of government interventioncan't solve.\nThe first of thesedecreasing costs in the provision of water supplymay be the most obvious. While it makes economic sense for isolated farmers to dig separate wells for themselves, the gathering of human populations speaks powerfully for the building of central water systems: big dams, huge wells, capacious reservoirs, giant treatment plants and pumping stations, Byzantine pipeline networks. These capital-intensive, long-lived systems exhibit such large economies of scalethe cost of collecting, treating and distributing an additional gallon of potable water is less than producing the previous gallonthat it's usually most efficient for just one large entity to provide water for a given population group.\nBut that, of course, is a monopoly, and private monopolies have an incentive to maximize profits by lowering quantities and raising prices above the competitive level (marginal cost). If a single company runs a city water supply, therefore, the city is likelyif the company is unregulatedto face higher prices and receive less water than competitive markets would provide. It's for that reason, among others, that governments usually run water systems or regulate the companies that do.\nExternalities and free water rides\nMore difficultfrom an economic perspectiveare problems that stem from the inescapable interdependency of most water uses. Whether or not you turn on your television has no impact on your neighbor, but filling your swimming pool might well decrease his ability to water his lawn. More broadly, the quantity and quality of water used by one person will impose costs on other users farther \"downstream.\" It's a classic example of an externality, and externalities make pricing difficult.\nPollution in Minnesota rivers and lakes is a good illustration. Washing dishes in Minneapolis is likely to add phosphorus (from the detergent) to the Mississippi River and eventually to the Gulf of Mexico, where it will nurture algae and kill fish. So Minneapolis water use incurs costs for others downriver, but not a penny of that cost is reflected in the city's water billand wouldn't be even if the Minneapolis water system were run privately, not municipally.\nExternalities due to the interconnectedness of water systems are more obvious, and painful, when combined with another characteristic of water: It is rarely either a purely private good or a purely public good, but rather a mixture of the two, or what many economists call an \"open-access\" or \"common-property\" good.\nThose are the terms economists use to describe something used by many people without direct payment: parks and highways, for instance. They're akin to \"public goods\" in that they're nonexcludable (very difficult or expensive to prevent people from using them), but unlike true public goods (national defense or sunsets), they're also rivalrous: One person's consumption of them is diminished by another's.\n(As University of Arizona economist Gary Libecap wrote, \"[rivalry] distinguishes common-property resources from public goods.\" Private goods are also rivalrous, but they're easily excludable: You can prevent others from using them at low cost. Excludability is necessarily a matter of political and/or economic costmore on this laterand changing politics or improved technology can make exclusion possible when it wasn't before, by lowering the cost of making something exclusive.)\nA busy highway is a common-property good. It's hard to keep people off of it (nonexcludable), and the more people who get on, the less valuable it is to each individual (rivalrous). The economic puzzle, of course, is that when you can't exclude people from using something, you can't really charge them for ita pricing problem that economists call \"free riding\"and the more likely people are to use it, a phenomenon that can lead to the \"tragedy of the commons\" if excessive use depletes the resource.\nWater is sometimes a private goodthink Evianand sometimes a public good: the knowledge of Lake Superior's splendor. But usually, water is a common-property resource. \"Most uses of water are going to be found up in that common-pool resource realm. Rival and nonexclusive,\" observed David Marcouiller, an economist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It's difficult to keep people from using lakes, rivers and aquifersso free riding is common. And the more rowboats you put on a lake, the less solitude per person. Indeed, the word \"rival\" is derived from the Latin rivalis, meaning \"one who uses the same stream.\" But the same concept applies to other resources with fluid boundaries and hard-to-establish property rights, like clean air, schools of fish and petroleum reservoirs.\nCutthroat competition\nThe Smith River near Helena, Mont., is a watery ribbon of paradise, according to outfitters who will charge you $3,000 for five days of floating and fishing on it. But Montana Trout Unlimited, an organization working to save fish in Montana streamscutthroat trout, in particularsays the river's value is being compromised by farmers and others who draw off river water (or sink wells) for irrigation.\nA dispute currently in front of the state's Department of Natural Resources and Conservation pits ranchersand the county golf coursewho are applying for permits to draw more water from the river or nearby aquifers against Trout Unlimited and other parties, including outfitters, homeowners and power companies.\nFarmers simply want enough water to grow crops, but downstream users say they're pulling too much water away from the river, depleting fisheries needed for spawning the threatened cutthroat, diminishing the value of downriver trips and riverside homes, and restricting water flow for hydroelectric generation. The permits have passed their first round of environmental assessment, but more reviewand possible court battlesseems likely.\nThe Smith River is a perfect storm of externalities, nonexcludability and intense rivalry over a common-property resource, but its predicament is far from unique. In the town of Conrad in northern Montana, public works director Steve Ruhd is trying to raise $4 million to move the pump house that pulls water from Lake Frances through miles of pipeline down to the 2,700 residents. The pumppaid for largely with federal grants and loanswould be a substantial upgrade of an aging system.\nBut Lake Frances is also the water source for the Pondera County Canal and Reservoir Co., the local irrigation outfit, and when water is short, relations with Conrad officials can be tense. In 2000, the town threatened to file an injunction to force a halt to irrigation. The threat pushed the company and town to communicate better, said Ruhd, and now, \"we're actually really making some progress, relationship-wise.\"\nLooking out his window at a late April shower of rain and snow, Ruhd said he's generally optimistic about summer water supplies. But another drain on the system makes him nervous.\n\"The [government] has been funding irrigation systems for the farmers,\" he said. \"They'll grant the farms 75 percent of the cost of a pivot irrigation system.\" Center-pivots use water more efficiently than flooding irrigation ditches, explained Ruhd, \"but it's also made it a lot easier for them to use. Instead of having to go out and spend several hours every day changing pipe or working, they can push a button and they're done. So they're irrigating more. They're using it more efficiently, but they're using more of it.\" That means supply problems for Ruhd and the Conrad residents he serves. \"They use more water and drain the lake more frequently,\" he said, of the center-pivot irrigators. \"We're going to have this problem real regular now.\"\nShotgun wetting\nMany water disputes in the Ninth District are similar to these: groups of individuals deeply concerned about the quality and quantity of water they'll be able to get for their lives and livelihoods, and highly aware of the demands others are making on \"their\" sources. Who actually owns the wateror more accurately, who has the right to use itis central in such disputes (see Parting the Waters). Clear property rights could help reconcile these disagreements, and functioning water markets depend upon them. But definitive property rights to this indispensable but amorphous fluid tend to elude the tightest legal grasp.\nIn 1973, Montana sought to clarify water rights by establishing a statewide process of claim adjudication. Progress has been limited. As of January 2003, fewer than 8 percent of the 219,417 water claims had been finalized. \"Montana's General Stream Adjudication is nothing if not ambitious,\" observed Doug Ritter of the Montana Water Court, in a recent article. \"It is the largest judicial proceeding ever attempted by this state. While the final goal ... is vital for the future, the process requires a great deal of commitment from the state and its citizens.\"\nBut budget deficits have limited that commitment, constraining staff resources for the painstaking process. And a frontier mindset still threatens to prevail. \"People here grow very impatient with the whole adjudication process,\" said Dave Johnson, recently retired from the U.S. Geological Survey in Helena, Mont. \"It may not actually come to this, but a lot of people feel 'I'll still take my shotgun and want to be as far upstream as possibleas long as I get the water out in the field, that's fine.' And no matter what the rights say, the farther downstream you are, the less likely you are to get your full water rights.\"\nTransaction costs\nThe ability to exclude someone from using wateror a highway, for that matteris central to the issue of establishing an accurate price for it, a price that reflects willingness to pay. Shotguns are one method of exclusion, certainly, and claims adjudication is another. Both are means of establishing property rights.\nBut both methods are costlywaving a shotgun can damage community relations and adjudication is an expensive legal process. And in a world without free lunches, excludability depends on the cost of keeping others out.\nIf you have a great swimming pond in your back yard, for example, it will become a common-property good unless you incur the expense of building a fence to keep out neighbors; whether your pond remains a private good depends on the price of pickets. Similarly, public lakes are common-property goodsand may be overusedunless governments charge and enforce user fees. Increasingly, governments are doing just that (usually in an effort to address budget deficits without raising income taxes), but the cost of enforcement is itself an impediment to preventing free riding, just as the cost of claims adjudication slows the clarification of Montana water rights.\nNobel laureate economist Ronald Coase referred to such outlays as \"transaction costs,\" and he noted that that if they're high enough, transaction costs can blunt the motivation to clarify property rights that might improve market function. \"In order to carry out a market transaction,\" he wrote, \"it is necessary to discover who it is that one wishes to deal with, to inform people that one wishes to deal and on what terms, to conduct negotiation ... to draw up the contract, to undertake the inspection needed to make sure the terms of the contract are being observed, and so on. These operations are often extremely costly.\"\nHigh transaction costs are the rule in water wars, where parties are numerous, claims are hotly disputed, and measurement is difficult, so creating contracts for water markets is challenging. \"The reason why some activities are not the subject of contracts is exactly the same as the reason why some contracts are commonly unsatisfactory,\" wrote Coase. \"It would cost too much to put the matter right.\"\nThe value of beauty\nA final pricing problem that impedes water market solutions is the fact that water holds values that are difficult, and perhaps impossible, to determine. Economists distinguish between use values and nonuse values. An obvious use-value for water is irrigation, for example, and establishing that value of water is fairly straightforward: How much crop would be produced without it vs. how much with?\nBut nonuse values are harder to measure and price. Indeed, while some of these are difficult to estimate, others are probably beyond determination. In the first category is the amenity value of water to a property owner. A trout-filled stream in one's backyard adds thousands to its valuethus the antagonism between irrigators and homeowners in Montana's Smith Valley. Economists estimate such values using hedonic econometric modelslooking at a large data set of properties, taking into consideration as many variables as possible and then statistically calculating the monetary contribution of specific amenities; more simply put, comparing a home with a trout stream to a similar home without it.\n\"You can look around any lake in Minnesota or Wisconsin and see very clearly that there's a premium paid for being close to the lake,\" observed economist Marcouiller. \"Hedonic models try to get at that premium. And actually that provides one good market-based mechanism ... real estate provides a proxy mechanism for valuing water.\"\nPrice check on existence\nFar more difficult is determining the worth of what economists call \"existence value.\" Most would agree that Minnesota's Boundary Waters have value simply because they exist as an inviolable refuge of great natural beauty. (The fact that we can camp, canoe and fish there is a separate, added value.) But putting a definitive price tag on that nonuse value is impossible. Economists try to get at it by surveying people: What are they willing to pay for the existence of the Boundary Waters? But such hypotheticals obviously don't meet a real-world market test. \"Unless you really take your wallet out and plop down some cash, it's all theoretical,\" noted Marcouiller.\nIn between such values are things like habitat protection. Water is essential for the preservation of the cutthroat trout and the piping plover, for example. It might be possible to estimate the market value of water to preserve cutthroat trout, since tourists love to catch them. But the nonmarket value of water in ensuring a species' existence is a tougher call.\n\"We've actually done a number of economic studies in terms of the value of fishing in Montana,\" noted Glenn Phillips, chief of the habitat protection bureau for Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. \"It's a major segment of our economy. That's one part of it. But the other thing is: How do you put a value on a species that could potentially go out of existence?\" (And indeed, some might argue that barge operators and Northern Plains farmers are also endangered species needing recognition and protection.)\nSuch values tend to be public goodsthings that are neither excludable nor rival: We all share the benefits of preserving nature. And some predict that demand for water to preserve such values will increase as incomes rise. \"Services such as recreation and habitat preservation have experienced a significant growth in demand over the past twenty years partly because they have high-income elasticities of demand,\" wrote economist Easter. \"Thus, in the future water is likely to be allocated in larger volumes to [such] services.\"\nShared responsibility\nThe fact that water's intrinsic characteristics make its economic values difficult to determine means that markets and governments will necessarily share the responsibility for determining its allocation. It is not an either/or proposition. The challenge, then, will be to determine which of water's services or values can best be delegated to the marketplace and to change legal and political institutions to facilitate that process.\nThere are some signs of promise. \"There is growing realization that water management provides a bundle of services that can be divided up, with some of the services better, more efficiently provided by the private sector,\" contends Easter. \"By unbundling services, the public sector can maintain its role where it is most important, i.e., protect against monopoly power, negative externalities, the underprovision of public goods, and the overuse of open access water. The private sector and market forces can then be used to help better manage and allocate water services.\"\nAnd in district states, examples exist of emergent market forces. In Montana, an innovative water-leasing program is building water markets to save fish habitat. State agencies and environmental groups have entered leases with farmers for their water rights. The farmer gets an annual payment, and the fish get more water left instream. \"If we're surgical about where we do it, from a fisheries perspective, then we can protect whole stretches of headwater streams for miles and miles,\" said John Wilson, conservation director of Trout Unlimited in Montana. But striking a deal can be difficult. \"Pricing is a big problem,\" said Wilson. \"We're having difficulty actually pricing that stuff. That's embryonic.\"\nIn Calumet, in Michigan's U.P., the city water system is privately owned and operateda legacy from the Calumet and Hecla Mining Co. According to an analysis by the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a privatization advocacy group, Calumet's water system operates more efficiently than comparable government-run systems in other Michigan communities.\nMilwaukee is in the middle of a 10-year contract with United Water, a water management corporation, to manage the city's sewers and the arrangement has worked well so far. But a similar arrangement in Atlanta fell apart earlier this yearand industry analysts predict the Atlanta split will freeze the already glacial pace of water privatization in the United States. Even if privatization works for Milwaukee sewers, its water supply is still a bone of contention: The city is fighting with its suburbs over water sales. But at least water is on the market.\nSafe predictions\nExpanding market opportunities for water will require extensive institutional change, said economist Easterfrom amending tax laws to relaxing the Endangered Species Actand such changes are likely to occur only if forced by rising conflicts over demand and supply. The weather will play a role, as will population growth and the economy, and all are subject to uncertainty. But three predictions seem safe: The power of the market will be hard to ignore, government will continue to intervene, and Twain's saying will remain apt.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Each employee of the state or its political subdivisions may select the day on which the employee desires to take the additional holiday provided for in this section after consultation with the employer pursuant to guidelines to be promulgated by rule of the appropriate personnel authority, or in the case of local government by ordinance or resolution of the legislative authority.\n(3) Employees of the state and its political subdivisions, including employees of school districts and those nonclassified employees of institutions of higher education who hold appointments or are employed under contracts to perform services for periods of less than twelve consecutive months, are entitled to two unpaid holidays per calendar year for a reason of faith or conscience or an organized activity conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or religious organization. This includes employees of public institutions of higher education, including community colleges, technical colleges, and workforce training programs. The employee may select the days on which the employee desires to take the two unpaid holidays after consultation with the employer pursuant to guidelines to be promulgated by rule of the appropriate personnel authority, or in the case of local government by ordinance or resolution of the legislative authority. If an employee prefers to take the two unpaid holidays on specific days for a reason of faith or conscience, or an organized activity conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or religious organization, the employer must allow the employee to do so unless the employee's absence would impose an undue hardship on the employer or the employee is necessary to maintain public safety. Undue hardship shall have the meaning established in rule by the office of financial management under RCW 43.41.109.\n(4) If any of the state legal holidays specified in this section are also federal legal holidays but observed on different dates, only the state legal holidays are recognized as a paid legal holiday for employees of the state and its political subdivisions. However, for port districts and the law enforcement and public transit employees of municipal corporations, either the federal or the state legal holiday is recognized as a paid legal holiday, but in no case may both holidays be recognized as a paid legal holiday for employees.\n(5) Whenever any state legal holiday:\n(a) Other than Sunday, falls upon a Sunday, the following Monday is the legal holiday; or\n(b) Falls upon a Saturday, the preceding Friday is the legal holiday.\n(6) Nothing in this section may be construed to have the effect of adding or deleting the number of paid holidays provided for in an agreement between employees and employers of political subdivisions of the state or as established by ordinance or resolution of the local government legislative authority.\n(7) The legislature declares that the following days are recognized as provided in this subsection, but may not be considered legal holidays for any purpose:\n(a) The eleventh day of January, recognized as human trafficking awareness day;\n(b) The thirteenth day of January, recognized as Korean American day;\n(c) The date corresponding with the second new moon following the winter solstice, or the third new moon following the winter solstice should an intercalary month intervene, recognized as the lunar new year;\n(d) The twenty-sixth day of January, recognized as Washington army and air national guard day;\n(e) The nineteenth day of February, recognized as civil liberties day of remembrance;\n(f) The ninth day of March, recognized as Billy Frank Jr. day;\n(g) The thirtieth day of March, recognized as welcome home Vietnam veterans day;\n(h) The thirty-first day of March, recognized as Cesar Chavez day;\n(i) The ninth day of April, recognized as former prisoner of war recognition day;\n(j) The tenth day of April, recognized as Dolores Huerta day;\n(k) The sixteenth day of April, recognized as Mother Joseph day;\n(l) The fifteenth day of May, recognized as water safety day;\n(m) The twenty-seventh day of July, recognized as national Korean war veterans armistice day;\n(n) The seventh day of August, recognized as purple heart recipient recognition day;\n(o) The fourth day of September, recognized as Marcus Whitman day;\n(p) The fourth Saturday of September, recognized as public lands day;\n(q) The second Sunday in October, recognized as Washington state children's day;\n(r) The twelfth day of October, recognized as Columbus day;\n(s) The seventh day of December, recognized as Pearl Harbor remembrance day;\n(t) The eighteenth day of December, recognized as blood donor day;\n(u) The first day of the tenth month of the Islamic calendar, which is lunar-cycle based and shifts by approximately 10 to 11 days each year, commonly called Eid al-Fitr; and\n(v) The tenth day of the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar, which is lunar-cycle based and shifts by approximately 10 to 11 days each year, commonly called Eid al-Adha.\n[ 2025 c 58 s 1001; 2025 c 30 s 1; 2024 c 76 s 3.

Babies under one year of age are more likely to drown at home, and 23 percent of child drownings occur during a family gathering near a pool.\nThe legislature finds that most of these deaths are completely preventable through education around water safety and drowning prevention and increasing equitable access to swimming lessons and water safety tools and equipment. The victims of childhood drowning are disproportionately from communities of color. Forty-five percent of Hispanic children and 64 percent of African American children have limited or no ability to swim, compared to 40 percent of Caucasian children. African American children ages five through 19 are specifically five and one-half times more likely to drown in a swimming pool compared to their Caucasian counterparts. In addition, male children are twice as likely to drown. Socioeconomic factors also have an impact on disproportionate outcomes. Children whose parents are unable to swim often lack the skill as well, and 79 percent of children in households with an income under $50,000 have limited or no ability to swim.\nThe legislature emphasizes the importance of educating children, parents, and other caregivers about the basics of swimming, floating, signs of drowning, and how to help drowning victims, as well as bringing awareness to critical layers of protection such as barriers and water safety tools and equipment. Drowning happens quickly and quietly, making it important to watch children closely, raise awareness, and emphasize education around water safety.\" [ 2023 c 181 s 1.]\nShort title—2023 c 181: \"In memory of those lost to drowning, this act may be known and cited as \"Yori's law.\" [ 2023 c 181 s 4.]\nFindings—Intent—2021 c 295: \"The legislature finds that on June 19, 1865, two and one-half years after President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation and two months after the end of the Civil War, news finally reached Galveston, Texas, that the Civil War had ended and that all enslaved persons were now released from the bondage of slavery. Slavery has left a catastrophic and unrelenting legacy of trauma for generations of Black/African Americans. Racism, discrimination, and inequity have been prevalent throughout the United States of America since 1619, which has cost Black/African Americans life, liberty, and prosperity.\nThe legislature also finds that June 19th has been celebrated in smaller communities across the nation as Juneteenth. Also known as Freedom Day, Jubilee Day, Liberation Day, and Emancipation Day, Juneteenth is a holiday that celebrates the emancipation of those who had been enslaved in the United States. Although this day has special significance for Black/African Americans in the state of Washington, the historical and continued harms of slavery and the rejoicing of the end of this atrocity should be acknowledged and celebrated by all Washingtonians.\nThe legislature intends to designate Juneteenth as a state legal holiday to celebrate the end of chattel slavery.

All blood receives immediate, comprehensive testing so that it can be available to regional hospitals, usually in less than twenty-four hours after donation. About one in seven people entering a hospital need blood. Blood is always needed for treatment of accident victims, cancer patients, hemophiliacs, and surgery patients. Blood cannot be manufactured. Blood is collected at local donor centers and mobile units travel to hundreds of blood drives every month at work sites, schools, places of worship, and other community locations throughout the Pacific Northwest. Blood donation is one of the most significant contributions that a person can make towards our society. When the Amtrak Cascades passenger train 501 tragically derailed near Olympia on December 18, 2017, our state came together to save the lives of more than eighty injured passengers. A team comprised of emergency responders, health care providers, ordinary citizens, and blood donors at blood centers throughout the state collected over two thousand units to respond to the lives of those in need. Blood donation is an integral community responsibility that connects all of us in our state. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to recognize and celebrate the incredible value of blood donors and blood donations in Washington by designating the eighteenth day of December as blood donor day.\" [ 2020 c 74 s 1.]\nFinding—Intent—2019 c 224: \"The legislature finds that the public lands managed by federal, state, and local governments are one of the state's finest and most remarkable attributes.

The excellence and pervasiveness of public lands in Washington are also integral to making it an attractive place for people to live, work, and play.

that racism and continued inequality is the legacy of slavery and acknowledging it is the first step in its eradication; and that since 1980 June 19th has been celebrated as Juneteenth across the United States as a day for people to come together in the spirit of reconciliation to commemorate the contributions of African Americans to this country's history and culture.\nThe legislature declares that an annual day of recognition be observed in remembrance of the day the slaves realized they were free as a reminder that individual rights and freedoms must never be denied.\" [ 2007 c 61 s 1.]\nFindings—2007 c 19: \"The legislature finds that in the more than one hundred years that Koreans have immigrated to the United States, these immigrants and their descendants have made an invaluable contribution to our state and nation.

The legislature further finds that due to the close friendship between the people of Korea and the United States, it is fitting to recognize Korean-American contributions to our society in a dignified and fitting manner, and to encourage Korean-Americans to honor the sacrifices made by American citizens during the Korean War.\" [ 2007 c 19 s 1.]\nLegislative declaration for civil liberties day of remembrance—2003 c 68: See RCW 1.16.090.\nFinding—1993 c 129: \"The legislature finds that Washington's children are one of our most valuable assets, representing hope for the future.

The article describes cases of a rare lung infection, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia(PCP), in five young, previously healthy gay men in Los Angeles. Los Angeles immunologist Dr. Michael Gottlieb, CDC’s Dr. Wayne Shandera, and their colleagues report that all the men have other unusual infections as well, indicating that their immune systems are not working. Two have already died by the time the report is published and the others will die soon after. This edition of the MMWR marks the first official reporting of what will later become known as the AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) epidemic.\n- June 5: The same day that the MMWR is published, New York dermatologist Dr. Alvin Friedman-KienExit Disclaimer calls CDC to report a cluster of cases of a rare and unusually aggressive cancer—Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS)—among gay men in New York and California. Like PCP, KS is associated with people who have weakened immune systems.\n- June 5-6: The Associated Press, the Los Angeles Times, and the San Francisco Chronicle report on the MMWR article. Within days, CDC receives reports from around the nation of similar cases of PCP, KS, and other opportunistic infections among gay men.\n- June 8: In response to these reports, CDC establishes the Task Force on Kaposi’s Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections to identify risk factors and to develop a case definition for the as-yet-unnamed syndrome so that CDC can begin national surveillanceExit Disclaimer of new cases.,,\n- June 16: A 35-year-old, white gay man who is exhibiting symptoms of severe immunodeficiency is the first person with AIDS to be admitted to the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

On the same day, the New York Times publishes an article entitled “Rare Cancer Seen in 41 HomosexualsExit Disclaimer.” At this point, the term “gay cancerExit Disclaimer” enters the public lexicon.\n- August 11: Acclaimed writer and film producer Larry KramerExit Disclaimer holds a meetingExit Disclaimer of over 80 gay men in his New York City apartment to discuss the burgeoning epidemic. Kramer invites Dr. Friedman-Kien to speak, and he asks the group to contribute money to support his research because he has no access to rapid funding. The plea raises $6,635—essentially the only new money, public or private, that will be raised to fight the epidemic for the remainder of the year.\n- August 28: The latest MMWR article, “Follow-Up on Kaposi’s Sarcoma and Pneumocystis Pneumonia,” reports that CDC has received information on 70 additional cases of KS and/or PCP since the July 3 edition.

The Committee met at 10 a.m., in room 216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Sherrod Brown, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN SHERROD BROWN Chairman Brown. The Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs will come to order. Today's hearing is a hybrid format. Witnesses are in person. Thank you to all seven of you for joining us, and I know yesterday was a long, grueling day. Today will be shorter, if nothing else, so thank you for giving us your time. Members have the option, however, to appear either in person or virtually. There will be good turnout on both sides, and I assume most of our colleagues in both parties will be here in person. For too long, everyone called this Committee simply Senate Banking, because it always delivered for Wall Street. We changed that, as the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. We put the Main Street economy, and the workers who power it, at the center of everything we do. Part of that commitment is to hear directly from the biggest banks that hold so much power in this economy. It is our job to hold them accountable to their workers, to their customers, and to the American people. Today, we will continue a tradition we started last year, and hear from the CEOs of the Nation's seven biggest retail banks. After years of consolidation and concentration, through banking crises and rubber-stamped mergers, your banks dominate the banking industry. Together, you have over $13 trillion--$13 thousand billion--in assets. That is half the Nation's GDP. You have hundreds of millions of customers. You also have the benefit of a Federal back, a safety net, something that your customers do not have. Your decisions affect millions of peoples' lives--whether they can get their paycheck, how much it will cost to use their hard-earned money, whether they can save for retirement or their children's education, whether they can buy a house or make their rent payment. And you profit from all those transactions to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. With those profits, and with the taxpayer support you get, come a responsibility to actually serve your customers and the larger economy. And I think you know you do not always hold up your end of the bargain. All of your banks have promoted, for example, Zelle, the payment app that most of you own. You pushed this on customers, but you have not taken responsibility for the fraud that it has perpetuated. We all know about Wells Fargo's fake account scandal. And we have learned that Wells was not alone. In the never-ending quest for short-term profits, it turns out that other banks pressured their employees to open false checking and credit card accounts. Customers who trust you to look out for them ended up with unjustified fees, damaged credit reports, and accounts they did not want, or in many cases did not even know about. It is even worse for Black and Brown borrowers. Too often they walk into many of your banks not knowing if their check will be cashed or if they will be able to open an account. When mortgage rates were at record lows, many of you were more likely to deny mortgages for Black and Brown borrowers, making it even harder for these families to build wealth through homeownership. You focus on loans to wealthy clients with massive stock portfolios, and at least one of you has complained about the paperwork on mortgages or small business loans for Main Street. And when consumers try to hold you accountable for cheating them out of their money, you subject far too many of them to forced arbitration. You take away people's choice on how to pursue justice because as we all know if there is one thing Wall Street hates, it is real consequences. And it is not just the outright scams and fraud that damage our economy. It is your entire business model, with short-term, quarterly profits as the Holy Grail. I have talked with workers in Ohio and across the country, in places that so often get passed over for investment. They tell me about the challenges they have with the banking system. They have watched your banks let them down, time and time again. It is why so many people do not trust the financial system. They have been burned over and over by second-chance accounts, foreclosures, late fees, overdraft fees. They have been turned down for loans. They have seen branches close. They have been scammed out of their money. Yesterday, I spoke to an Ohioan whose accounts were illegally frozen by one of your banks. She had zero access to her funds for a whole week, and the bank intended to take $442 out of her account, leaving her with nothing. So it is not surprising that more and more Americans turn to shady payday lenders or risky crypto apps. They feel like they do not have any other choice when they have bills piling up and need to come up with the money. Over a third--and you have heard this number--over a third of Americans report they would not be able to cover a $400 expense in an emergency--think of that, if their car breaks down, if they lose their job, if their child needs surgery or something. All of you make tens of millions of dollars a year--150 to 900 times what your median employee makes. You do not think twice about $400. That is not a luxury that most Americans have. They do not get the same breaks you do. During the pandemic, the Federal Reserve waived overdraft fees for you, for banks, yet none of you waived those fees for your customers in 2020. And it is not just your customers who have to make tough choices because of decisions that you make. It is also your workers. You spend your billions in profits on exorbitant executive pay and stock buybacks instead of investing in your workers, your customers, your communities. You say that you provide your workers with good pay and benefits, but how does it feel as a worker to be pressured to open fake accounts, or to deny services to someone who walks in the door who does not look like you--hardly a culture promoting the dignity of work. Do not take it from me. Listen to what bank workers have said. From one Wells Fargo worker: ``We want the customer base to know we are forming a union really for them. We are tired of having our name dragged through the mud at Wells Fargo because of things that we have asked to have more control over, but the company refuses to give us that control.'' But it is not just Well Fargo. Another worker said, ``They keep telling us we no longer have sales goals but we are given expectations as far as loan volume, new accounts, day-one mobile activations. Not meeting these expectations will result in disciplinary action.'' They added, ``But the loyalty and responsibility I feel for my customers keeps me fighting every day.'' Just trust us, you say. We are making changes. We do not need Government watchdogs. We do not need regulations. But trust goes both ways. With crisis after crisis, with scandal after scandal, the biggest Wall Street banks have lost the trust of the American people. And as super regional banks get bigger and more complex, they are starting to look more and more like Wall Street. I expect all of your banks to buildup capital, and use it to invest in communities, not just your shareholders, not just your own compensation, and we expect you to treat your customers fairly. We expect you to take steps to make banking work better for your customers and your workers. Steps like eliminating overdraft and excessive fees, lowering the costs of basic bank accounts, ending forced arbitration, offering affordable home loans to all eligible borrowers in all communities. It means paying your workers, including contractors who feed you, contractors who clean your offices, contractors who keep your banks and offices safe, paying them a living wage. Some of your banks have taken positive steps to eliminate some fees and give consumers more power and choice over their own money. We thank you for that. Some of your banks have made commitments to increase your workers' wages. We thank you for that. That is a good start. These positive steps need to be part of a real commitment for changing how Wall Street does business, not just one-offs. You are among the most powerful people in this country, in our economy. Your entire industry and its substantial safety net are supported by American taxpayers. It is past time for the financial industry to be as good to the American people as the country has been to each you. We will continue to hold you to the highest standards so that Americans can keep more of their hard-earned money. Ranking Member Toomey. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PATRICK J. TOOMEY Senator Toomey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome back to many of the witnesses. Welcome for the first time to some. Today's hearing presents an opportunity to discuss the role of the Nation's largest banks. At the outset, let me acknowledge what should be obvious: banks are essential for supporting the economy and advancing American competitiveness. Their core functions of taking deposits, making loans, and processing payments, and in several cases, underwriting and making markets in securities, these all help to safeguard savings and provide credit, which enables economic growth. With nearly $13 trillion in combined assets and operations ranging from mortgage banking to small business lending, the banks here today make vital contributions to the Nation's prosperity. But where I see a system at the heart of free enterprise, I worry other policymakers see opportunity for social engineering. There are activist regulators and some of my colleagues who see banks as a tool by which they can advance their social policy. Unfortunately, there is a growing trend among some banks-- several of whom are represented here today--of inserting themselves into highly charged social and political issues really unrelated to their businesses. Banks' willingness to help liberal policymakers achieve their goals makes it very difficult to mount a principled defense against such politicization. Some of my colleagues are pressuring banks to use both their balance sheets and their influence to address issues wholly unrelated to banking, such as global warming, gun control, voter rights, even abortion. Several large banks have been too willing to acquiesce to these demands by embracing an ESG agenda that is harmful to America. Nearly every bank at this hearing has pledged to meet a ``net zero'' greenhouse gas emission goal by 2050, with several making even more specific commitments. But absent some major technological breakthrough, carrying through on such pledges will eventually lead these banks to artificially restrict, reduce, or even cutoff funding for traditional energy projects. Despite statements to the contrary, none of this really has much to do with borrowers' credit quality or so-called transition risk. It is because activists have made the traditional energy sector politically disfavored. We are witnessing the folly of such policy right now in Europe, which strangled its own fossil energy sector and now finds itself deeply reliant on Russia for gas. Does anyone really believe that as the U.S. experiences 40-year high inflation we should exacerbate the problem by reducing oil and natural gas production and increasing energy prices? But that is exactly what will happen if banks follow through with their ``net zero'' pledges and ESG agenda, as environmental activist groups have urged them to do. When you combine that with the SEC's proposed climate disclosure rule, these ``net zero'' pledges are setting up banks for lawsuits and legal liability. Apparently some banks may be starting to acknowledge this reality. A report in the Financial Times this week says some banks are considering leaving the so-called ``Net-Zero Banking Alliance,'' a UN-sponsored group that intends to name and shame banks that do not meet net zero pledges. In my view, it was a mistake to join this group in the first place, but for the sake of shareholders and the U.S. economy, banks distancing themselves now would be a welcome step. In addition, banks have inserted themselves into contentious social issues, and in some cases, even made business decisions based on these factors. For example, several banks responded to pressure from Democrats in the wake of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision by very publicly pledging to pay for the costs of their employees to travel to have abortions. This decision is certainly an individual bank's choice, but it does raise a number of questions, including, have these same banks also committed to pay the costs for their female employees facing unplanned pregnancies to place their children up for adoption? Notably, when it comes to the right to keep and bear arms, which is an actual constitutional right, some banks have gone out of their way to make it harder for law-abiding Americans to exercise this right, from stopping the financing of manufacturers of so-called military-style firearms for civilian use to de-banking retailers that sell firearms to customers under 21 years of age, even when such sales are lawful. I cannot help but observe that when banks do choose to weigh in on these highly charged social and political issues, they always seem to always come down on the liberal side of the political spectrum. Beyond the examples I have already given, there are others. Banks that have opined on abortion, but not religious liberty. Banks that have expressed support for voting access, but are silent on voting security. Banks that have expressed support for DACA, but I have not heard much about border security. So in my view it is bad business to alienate roughly half the country, but you are private companies and are free to opine as you see fit. But it is no wonder that there has been a backlash from policymakers in States like Texas, West Virginia, and Florida. If banks do not cease and desist from weighing in on social and cultural issues, do not be shocked if Republicans, once back in power nationally, seek to pressure banks to advance their goals. Now I would oppose such efforts, just as I oppose similar efforts by liberals. But once the precedent is set, the potential for future abuse is limitless. Throughout this Congress, I have repeatedly warned about the politicization of our financial regulators and our central bank. I have emphasized that addressing political issues requires difficult decisions involving tradeoffs. In a democratic society, those tradeoffs must be made by elected representatives who are accountable to the American people. Today, I am raising similar concerns about the politicization of our Nation's banks. Just as regulators and central bankers are not elected by the American people, neither are bank CEOs. So banks are currently at a critical crossroads: accept the role that some liberals prefer which is to have your institutions implement social policy on behalf of the State, or embrace your history as drivers and promoters of free enterprise and stay out of highly charged social and political issues. I strongly suggest you choose the latter path, and I suggest that if you do not, you do risk being treated as public utilities, by both parties, in the future. Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Toomey. Let me introduce the seven witnesses, starting with Mr. Scharf. Mr. Charles Scharf has been CEO of Wells Fargo since October of 2019. Welcome, Mr. Scharf.

I guess you know the first question. Mr. Scharf, you begin, please. STATEMENT OF CHARLES W. SCHARF, CEO AND PRESIDENT, WELLS FARGO & COMPANY Mr. Scharf. Thank you, Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Toomey, and Members of the Committee. Good morning and thank you for the opportunity to be here today. Since October of 2019, I have had the privilege of leading Wells Fargo. I reflect on my time at the company. I am incredibly proud of how we used our financial strength during difficult times to support our customers, employees, and communities we serve while we have worked to transform the company at the same time. I believe that our Nation benefits from a strong Wells Fargo, and it has never been more true than today. The last time I appeared before this Committee the country was in the middle of a pandemic, and my testimony and many of your question focused on what banks were doing to support the communities in which we operate. Those were important questions then and they are equally important today, given the complexities of the high inflationary environment. Since 2020, Wells Fargo has provided billions of dollars in emergency lending to America's small businesses. We donated approximately $420 million in fees from that lending to small business owners who struggled during the pandemic through our Open For Business Fund. These funds are estimated to have reached more than 150,000 business owners nationally, and preserve approximately 250,000 jobs. Last year alone, we helped more than half-a-million homeowners with new, low-rate loans to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and we closed billions of dollars in new commitments for affordable housing. Between 2017 and 2021, we increased average wages for our U.S. hourly employees by nearly 25 percent, and increased investments in our U.S. employee benefits by 20 percent, and we launched a unique special purpose credit program, committing $150 million to help eligible Black homeowners lower their interest rates and reduce their monthly payments. In addition, we issued a second sustainability bond in the amount of $2 billion that will finance projects and programs supporting housing affordability, economic opportunity, renewable energy, and clean transportation. Our work is bolstered by our Banking Inclusion Initiative, a 10-year program to help unbanked individuals gain access to affordable, mainstream, digitally enabled accounts. Though our work is not complete, Wells Fargo approaches issues differently and is a better company than when I arrived. We have driven a tremendous amount of change and established a much stronger foundation for the long term, with a clear sense of urgency on building our risk and control infrastructure. We have changed our operating structure, simplified our businesses, and have a new leadership team in place with the necessary skills and experience to transform Wells Fargo. Almost 70 percent of our company's Operating Committee is new since I joined. Additionally, well over half of the senior-most people in the company, meaning those one level below the Operating Committee, are new to their roles. We have also meaningfully improved diversity in our senior ranks. Additionally, last week we announced that we will commission an external, third-party racial equity audit. The assessment will focus on elements of Wells Fargo's efforts to serve diverse communities and promote a diverse workforce. Commissioning this work is a critical next step in reinforcing our commitment to racial equity and helping close the wealth gap in this country. Looking forward, I recognize that the country may be facing uncertain economic times for months to come. I can assure you that Wells Fargo is keeping a close eye on consumer spending and credit trends and that we will continue to be a constructive partner in forging an inclusive recovery. We recognize that COVID-19 has left many people still in need, and the current inflationary environment has added stress. As a company we will continue to provide support to our customers, employees, and communities we serve over the long term. In conclusion, I want to express my sincere gratitude to everyone at Wells Fargo who has continued to serve our customers and each other as well as our communities through these challenging times. I appreciate their dedication and resiliency as we have worked to make Wells Fargo better. While we still have much work to do, our foundation is stronger, our business is more focused, we are driving cultural change, and the changes we have made to the company are making a positive impact. I am confident that we have the management team in place to complete the work ahead. Thank you, and I welcome your questions. Chairman Brown. Thank you, Mr. Scharf. Mr. Moynihan, welcome. STATEMENT OF BRIAN THOMAS MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA Mr. Moynihan. Thank you, Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Toomey, and distinguished Members of the Committee. Good morning to all of you. It is an honor to be here to represent my 210,000-plus teammates at Bank of America and talk to you about how we deliver Responsible Growth. This is how we run our company. We deliver for our clients, our teammates, our communities, and our shareholders. We are delivering both profits and purpose. That includes being a great place to work, with a core tenet of Responsible Growth. We invest heavily in our teammates and their families. This year we raised our minimum hourly wage to $22 an hour, and are on track to increase it to $25 an hour by 2025. We also made an across-the-board pay adjustment to all U.S. employees who earn less than $100,000, increasing their wages by 3 to 7 percent based on the years of service. This is above and beyond the business-as-usual pay cycle. For the fifth time this year we delivered special compensation awards to our teammates worth $1 billion, that went to 97 percent of our employees. We did not raise medical premiums for teammates who earned under $50,000, the 12th year in a row we have done that. Our global workforce is 50 percent women, and 49 percent of our teammates are people of color. Our management team is 55 percent diverse, including 32 percent women. Our board is 53 diverse, including 33 percent women. We continue to help our clients manage their financial lives. Over the past year alone, our lending to individuals and families grew by 9 percent, our loans to small businesses grew by 8 percent, and our small business line of business we have $22 billion in outstanding loans today. Our brand and customer scores are the best sustained shape we have ever seen. We support our clients, with $1 trillion in loans, and we hold $1.9 trillion in their deposits, all to help them live their financial lives. Ninety-five percent of our PPP loans have been paid off or forgiven. We continue to expand our nationwide network of financial centers and invest heavily in our industry-leading and award-winning digital capabilities. Through both, we deliver transparent, easy-to-use products that serve to help our customers save, spend, and borrow. As an example, beginning in 2009, we began to take steps to empower our clients to reduce overdraft usage. We first eliminated overdraft fees for clients when using debit cards at the point of sale, and have not allowed opt-in for over a dozen years. We also created no-overdraft-fee accounts, and now have 4 million of those accounts. We have since eliminated fees for nonsufficient funds in our consumer deposit accounts. We reduced overdraft fees from $35 to $10 per occurrence, and we removed the ability to overdraft at the ATM. The second quarter call reports by the regulators show our nonsufficient funds and overdraft fees are down 66 percent from last year's second quarter, and they will continue to fall as the rest of the program is put in during the quarter. Responsive growth also shows where we have an impact in the communities where we live and work. In 2021, we continued our long record with $375 million in charitable giving. My teammates reported 1.6 million volunteer hours across our franchise. We continue to be a lender in support of small businesses and entrepreneurs in our communities. We provide more than $2 billion to CDFIs to finance affordable housing, community facilities, and small businesses. We invested in the common equity of dozens of minority depository institutions, and we have over $100 million in deposits for those institutions. We committed $350 million to 100 private equity funds. Those funds are operated by minority and woman entrepreneurs, and they providing funding to minority- and women-operated companies. Nearly 1,000 companies have been invested in by those funds. Responsible Growth requires the support of clients of every size and every sector to support a just transition to a sustainable future and energy security for the U.S. and around the world. We believe that capitalism remains the best way, and the only way, to tackle the challenges facing society and the transition to a secure energy environment. The private sector simply has the funding, the scale, the long-term thinking to help these toughest issues. In 2021, we had $250 billion in loans and other support to clients in the area of sustainable finance. This includes $150 billion focused on clean energy transition. We work with companies in all sectors, including oil and gas clients who are investing to help drive clean energy. I joined Senator Cramer in North Dakota to talk about carbon capture, and we are investing in a company we met there. Responsible Growth also means delivering for our shareholders. We delivered strong profitability, returned billions of dollars to our shareholders in dividend stock repurchase. This is Responsible Growth. This is capitalism in action. Thank you, and we look forward to our discussion. Chairman Brown. Thank you, Mr. Moynihan. Mr. Dimon, you are recognized. STATEMENT OF JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. Mr. Dimon. Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Toomey, and Members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about JPMorgan Chase, the role of America's largest banks as a force for good for the country, its citizens, and the global economy. We live in the greatest country in the world, built on foundational principles of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of enterprise, the sanctity of the individual, and the promise of equality and opportunity for all. These core values are the fabric that binds us Americans, where the best of what we are shines through, especially in times of adversity. This system has created what is still the most prosperous and innovative economy the world has ever seen, one that nurtures vibrant businesses, large and small, and is a welcoming environment for innovation, science, and technology. My enduring faith in the strength of the country remains as strong as ever. The free flow of credit and investments is key to our Nation's global competitiveness. Free enterprise is the flywheel of the economy as capital seeks out investments, individuals, and ideas that drive growth and innovation. And free enterprise celebrates and is inseparable from human freedom and innovation, which ultimately are the stimulus for all human progress. The secret sauce of free enterprise is not the free movement of capital but importantly the value of knowledge and free people exercising their rights. What this country needs most is free enterprise, extraordinarily competent Government and policies, and more civic-minded companies and citizens. The work we do at JPMorgan Chase matters in good times but particularly in tough times. We provide critical financing to nearly every sector, including manufacturing, service, energy, real estate, and transportation. We finance Federal, State, local governments for infrastructure projects and we finance schools, bridges, hospitals, and universities. We have long championed the central role of banking in a community as potential for bringing people together, to enable companies and individuals to reach for their dreams, and for being a source of strength in difficult times. We finance America's ambitions with loans for homes, autos, and growing a small business, and provide value, products, and services to more than half of American households. We know that our business is only as strong as our communities so we are focused in lifting up traditionally underserved communities by increasing home ownership, expanding affordable rental housing, and growing small business. The last few volatile years have brought stress and disruption to many, as the world grapples with war in Ukraine, economic volatility and inflation, economic insecurity, climate change, and a pandemic. It has also shown what great companies of the size and scale of JPMorgan Chase can do as a source of strength for the economy. Because we have a strong and healthy company, we can consistently serve and finance American households and businesses while building our communities and protecting America and the American economy. As guardians of the financial system, we support our Government and national security efforts to combat financial crimes and to carry out complex sanctions. Each year we practically identify Nation State and cyber-criminal threats and work closely with the Government to help protect critical infrastructure, and we fuel good American jobs. The businesses we finance collectively employ hundreds of millions of Americans, and as a large employer ourselves, we employ people in every State in the country with starting wages that far exceed any Government minimum wage, plus full benefits, retirement, job training, and career opportunities. I want to close by thanking the more than 280,000 employees of JPMorgan Chase. I want the public to know how proud I am of all of you who work in every State in this country, the work that you do tirelessly for our customers with a singular focus of doing the right thing. You work on behalf of our shareholders, real people in our communities including teachers, law enforcement, health care workers, and people saving for retirement. Many of you have faced personal challenges through the pandemic, whether it was your own health or the health of a loved one, or managing your children's education and child care needs. At the same time, our work has never been more important or more difficult than the last several years. You continued to persevere with the grace and fortitude that makes me extraordinarily proud. I have been particularly moved by our essential worker population, the tens of thousands of you who continued to come to work during the height of the pandemic to serve our customers when they needed you the most. You have my deep gratitude, and for all JPMorgan Chase employees who performed your jobs with integrity and excellence every day, you embody the best of American values and make your country proud. Thank you, Members of the Committee, for the work you do for our country. I look forward to working with all of you to solve the challenges facing our country and help grow and safeguard the economy. Chairman Brown. Thank you, Mr. Dimon. Ms. Fraser, you are recognized. STATEMENT OF JANE FRASER, CEO, CITIGROUP Ms. Fraser. Thank you very much, Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Toomey, and Members of the Committee. Good morning and thank you very much for the honor of representing Citigroup today. When a similar group convened with this Committee last year, we shared how our banks supported the economy during the global pandemic. Today, while the worst of COVID may be behind us, the economic challenges we are facing are no less daunting. The reforms you put in place and the work we have done since the financial crisis to strengthen our banks' financial foundation have enabled us to continue to be a source of stability. While today I am a proud American citizen, as someone who grew up in the U.K. I can attest to the strength and the fact that the banking system in the USA and the capital markets here in the States, they are the envy of the world. Our financial institutions and our financial markets are essential to American competitiveness, both abroad and here in the U.S., and they are the reason why the U.S. is such a top destination for foreign direct investment. As living expenses for Americans increase and concerns about the economy grow, we remain focused on our role as a bank in job and in wealth creation. Through Citi's extensive global network and footprint we partner with the most iconic American institutions and businesses as well as the Federal Government to help them navigate the global economy. We have been supporting our clients so that they build resiliency, they reconfigure supply chains, and they adapt to inflationary pressures. And we help these institutions invest in projects that put them in a position to succeed in the 21st century, and these investments put a lot of people to work here in the States. The private sector clients we serve are where millions of Americans proudly earn their living, and those clients rely on vendors and suppliers that, in turn, employ millions more. And at Citi, we employ 70,000 people here in the U.S., working in cities across the country such as Sioux Falls, Tucson, and Newark. The work we do with our public sector partners is a prime example of how we put our balance sheet to work to benefit local communities. In 2021 alone, we partnered with State and local governments to catalyze more than $27 billion in infrastructure investment such as schools, hospitals, and roads. And many of these large projects would not have been possible without a bank of Citi's scale to back them. We financed more than $5.6 billion in affordable housing projects last year in communities across 32 States, from California to Ohio to New York, and this total made us the number one affordable housing lender in the U.S. for the 12th year in a row. Breaking down barriers to banking is also a top priority for us. In fact, this past summer we became the first of the largest U.S. banks to completely eliminate overdraft fees and returned item fees for our customers, and earlier this year we launched a first of its kind Diverse Financial Institutions Group to lead our engagement with minority depository institutions and diverse broker-dealers and asset managers. This group is focused on helping these diverse institutions scale and expand into new markets, and includes a groundbreaking rotational program that embeds Citi executives within the MDIs, and that is for up to a year. So bottom line, my Citi colleagues and I understand and embrace the responsibility that banks play in advancing economic empowerment and mobility. I hope my pride in Citi's story has come through, but I also want to be clear about recognizing the need to continue improving, as we strive to build a safer and sounder bank for the future. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you about the work that we are doing to support American consumers and businesses, and I look forward to your questions. Thank you. Chairman Brown. Thank you, Ms. Fraser. Mr. Rogers, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Thank you. STATEMENT OF WILLIAM H. ROGERS, JR., CHAIRMAN AND CEO, TRUIST FINANCIAL CORPORATION Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Toomey, and Members of the Committee. Good morning. I am Bill Rogers. I am the Chairman and CEO of Truist, and I am proud to be here today on behalf of our 50,000 teammates. Thank you for this opportunity to testify today. Truist is a purpose-driven company, and that purpose is to inspire and build better lives and communities. This drives Truist's mission for our teammates, for our clients, and the many communities and stakeholders that we serve. For our teammates, our mission is to create an inclusive and energizing environment that empowers teammates to learn, grow, and have meaningful careers. Truist's minimum starting pay rate of $22 an hour is among the highest in the industry. Our career development programs provide a pathway to professional growth. They include offerings at the Truist Leadership Institute as well as tuition reimbursement for education that supports career advancement. We also accelerated career development for Truist leaders from diverse backgrounds, which has helped us meet our goal of 15 percent diverse representation in leadership roles a year ahead of our original goal. To help ensure our teammates' financial security extends into retirement, we offer eligible teammates both a defined benefit pension plan and a 401(k) match, at perhaps the highest levels in the industry. For our clients, our mission is to provide distinctive, secure, and successful client experience through touch and technology. We recently launched Truist One Banking, which includes two new deposit accounts with no overdraft fees as well as other features to accelerate our clients' journey toward financial well-being. Today, 87 percent of our clients interact with us digitally. We are evolving our products and services to help ensure we continue to offer a best-in-class client experience that is intuitive, efficient, and secure. Client security is a Truist priority, and my written testimony outlines actions we are taking to protect our clients. We welcome opportunities to work more closely with law enforcement and policymakers at every level to help protect our banking system from organized and sophisticated criminal attacks. Even when most client interactions occur digitally, exceptional client service often requires the personal touch that our Truist teammates provide. Personal touch made the difference for many of our clients navigating the PPP process. At the outset of the pandemic and in the middle of our merger, thousands of teammates worked directly with their business clients to meet their fast-changing financial needs. I am extremely proud and appreciative of the client letter we received, thanking our teammates for helping secure PPP loans that kept their small businesses open and their employees employed. For the many other stakeholders we serve our mission is to optimize long-term value through safe, sound, and ethnical practices. Truist is a Main Street bank. Our teammates serve our clients at more than 2,000 branches in 17 States and Washington, DC. We are committed to being a good neighbor and contributing back to the communities where we do business. In 2019, we committed to a $60 billion Community Benefits Plan, which included mortgage lending for low- and middle-income borrowers, commitments to small businesses, and community development lending, community development grants, as well as the establishment of 15 new branches in LMI communities. I am pleased to report through August 2022, we estimate that our combined lending, investing, and philanthropic financing activities have already exceeded this commitment, and we will open 16 new branches in LMI or majority-minority communities by the end of this year. In addition, Truist has been a strong supporter of MDIs and CDFIs. In 2020, a $40 million Truist donation helped establish CornerSquare, a new nonprofit that provides capital to racially and ethnically diverse small business owners. In 2021, Truist committed $50 million to serve as an anchor investor, along with Microsoft, on the FDIC's Mission Driven Institution investment fund. And in June, Truist committed an additional $120 million to strengthen and support small businesses with a focus on Black, Latine, and women-owned businesses. In conclusion, I want to thank all of our Truist teammates for the purposeful way that they serve our clients and our communities and each other. They inspire me every day, and I am honored to lead this company. Thank you for this opportunity to share our purpose journey, and I look forward to answering your questions. Chairman Brown. Thank you, Mr. Rogers. Mr. Cecere, welcome. STATEMENT OF ANDY CECERE, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT, AND CEO, U.S. BANCORP Mr. Cecere. Good morning, Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Toomey, and distinguished Members of the Committee. Thank you for inviting me to speak with you today. U.S. Bank is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and holds one of the longest active banking charters in the United States. We have spent nearly 160 years serving individuals, families, businesses, and communities, and striving to be a responsible and innovative leader in the financial services industry. At U.S. Bank we operate a simple, straightforward company, with four core businesses: consumer and business banking, corporate and commercial banking, payment services, and wealth management and investment services. We have earned a reputation for being well-managed, financially sound, and responsible in our approaches to underwriting and risk, and this is reflected in our high debt ratings. These achievements are possible only because of our 70,000 exceptional team members. We work hard to take care of their needs and invest in their career growth and development. This commitment has been further reflected in our newly expanded leave benefits and our recently announced increase in entry- level pay. Thanks to our incredible team, we provide exceptional banking experience to our customers. Our retail banking services are accessible when, where, and how our customers prefer, whether virtually or in-person in one of our retail branches, which we operate in 26 States. There are a few areas of our retail banking business that I want to highlight today. First, we have pioneered several digital enhancements. In addition to our award-winning mobile app we created a tool for our bankers to co-browse remotely with their customers on video. This solution helps customers feel heard and understood when they need help making important financial transactions. Second, we made it easier for individual customers and small businesses to access credit. I know policymakers on this Committee have been seeking a short-term, low-cost, small- dollar solution for people who have emergency cash needs. Four years ago we provided a solution for our customers. Our simple loan product allows customers to receive a loan of up to $1,000 in a matter of minutes on our mobile app. We have similarly streamlined our services for small businesses. We now can process and fund a small business loan in less than 15 minutes. Third, we are working to make home ownership a reality for more Americans across both rural communities and in our country's cities. One such initiative we have launched is Access Home, a program designed to increase Black home ownership by engaging with community partners. We continue to provide mortgage servicing to local housing finance authorities as we did throughout the pandemic, and we are a leading FHA lender. Our commitment to serving the financial needs of Americans truly includes all Americans. We recognize that being a good corporate citizen goes well beyond providing world-class financial services. In 2021, we developed Access Commitment, a multi-dimensional initiative to work to close the racial wealth gap across communities. Fulfilling these commitments is important to me, and we have made substantial progress. Last year, we provided nearly $200 million in capital to Black-owned or led businesses and organizations. We made $305 million in loan commitments to CDFIs, and we have made supplier diversity a priority, and we are spending nearly $500 million annually in that area. Still, we have pledged to do more. In addition to our commitment to close the racial wealth gap, U.S. Bank is also committed to promoting diversity. This commitment starts with me, and I have seen first-hand the benefits of championing diversity at U.S. Bank. Diversity strengthens our businesses, attracts talent, and allows us to better serve our customers. Our efforts in this area have been recognized. Earlier this year, DiversityInc named U.S. Bank to its top 50 companies for diversity for the fourth year in a row. In closing, we believe relationships are a key differentiator for our bank. That is why we are taking the best of our person-to-person interactions and enhancing them with new digital capabilities to connect our customers with their trusted partners and advisors. Today, as always, our focus is on serving people. Relationships are the center of our business and the core of the communities we serve, and that commitment will never change. With that, thank you for your time and for the work you do for your country. I look forward to your questions. Chairman Brown. Thank you, Mr. Cecere. Mr. Demchak, welcome. STATEMENT OF WILLIAM S. DEMCHAK, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT, AND CEO, THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP Mr. Demchak. Thank you, Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Toomey, and the distinguished Members of the Committee. I am pleased to be here today on behalf of PNC. PNC is a Main Street bank. We are not a Wall Street bank. My office is on Fifth Avenue, but Fifth Avenue in Pittsburgh. We are essentially in the same business as we have been in for 170 years since we founded the bank. We help customers save money, borrow money, and move money. We are a large bank by historical standards but we are just one-sixth the size of some of the institutions represented on this table. We have limited capital markets, derivate and foreign operations. PNC is not a global, systemically important bank. What we are is a financially strong and resilient bank that is committed to serving our consumers in a fair and transparent way. I am proud that PNC was the first large bank to modify its overdraft practices. Since the rollout of what we call Low Cash Mode, our overdraft fees have dropped by nearly 50 percent and continue to fall. We have also made it easier for consumers to send and receive payments. PNC, along with other owner banks of Early Warning Services developed and rolled out Zelle, a real-time P2P payment platform. Zelle provides consumers with a free and convenient way to send money to individuals and businesses. And despite the headlines, disputes within the Zelle network make up less than 10 basis points of all transactions. This is not true of other regulated P2P platforms. In one instance, one of those platforms has 13 times, at least in the case of PNC, 13 times the amount of disputes as the Zelle network. Better, however, is not good enough, and scams, in particular, continue to grow across our financial ecosystem. Scams are different than fraud, traditional fraud, in that a bad actor gets a consumer to initiate the transaction themselves. These scams are growing daily, and the industry regulators and legislators need to respond. It is not enough to apportion the blame after the fact. We need to stop fraud and scams before they occur. Secure networks like Zelle, Real-Time payments and potentially FedNow allow for direct authentication with a host bank. They also allow members of the network to identify, close, and police against scam accounts. This is not the case with nonbank networks. These networks are not held to the same security standards as banks. When a scam occurs, banks like PNC have zero visibility into where the money went, we have zero visibility to get the money back, and we have zero ability to close those bad accounts. Banks follow the standards set under Gramm-Leach-Bliley, and we are regularly, if not continually, examined for compliance. Nonbank data aggregators are not subject to examination and supervision. Instead, they hold the financial data of tens of millions of U.S. consumers, and rely on something called ``screen scraping'' to gather and sell that consumer information. Twelve years ago, the CFPB was given authority based on 1033 of Dodd-Frank to end screen scraping, to secure data, and to stop the reselling of confidential consumer data through the fintech ecosystem. Essentially, they were given the authority to stop scams before they occur. This has not happened, and consumers are paying the price. PNC has had a social purpose since the day it was founded. As a service organization, we believe our success is directly tied to the success of our customers and communities. We succeed when our customers and communities thrive and when our employees feel valued and are rewarded for helping fulfill our purpose. Our commitment to our communities is reflected in PNC's outstanding rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, a rating that we have enjoyed since that was enacted 40 years ago. We also succeed by being diverse and inclusive, which starts at the top of the organization. Half of our independent directors and half of my direct reports are women or people of color. I am honored to be here today and represent the 60,000 employees who work hard every day to serve our customers and deliver for our communities. It is a fairly safe assumption that all of our constituents are as divided on their views of today's challenges as everybody else in our country. Our job as a bank, and my job as a leader, is not to arbitrate on who is right or wrong, but rather to find common ground and to deliver on our promise to serve customers, to keep them safe, and to provide capital to our great economy so that everyone may prosper. Thank you, and I welcome any questions you may have. Chairman Brown. Thank you, Mr. Demchak. Mr. Scharf, is Wells Fargo too broken to fix? Mr. Scharf. Chairman Brown, I am very confident that we have made changes which will enable us to put all of our historical problems behind us. As I mentioned in my testimony, we are an entirely different company today. We have a new management team. We have changed our processes. The plans that we have in place, across all of the identified historical issues, are being executed upon. And the team that we have working on this has the experience and the knowledge to get the work done. Chairman Brown. Thank you. It just seems to a lot of us, CEO after CEO, year after year, scandal after scandal, nothing at Wells Fargo seems to improve. Let me go down the line. I will ask a series of yes-or-no questions. You all have a legal and moral responsibility to do right by your workers and your customers and expand access to affordable banking to everyone. Yet ordinary Americans still are denied basic access that all of us here take for granted. Ensuring fair access to banking requires your management teams to make it a central focus. I am going to ask questions with that in mind, how you can better serve your customers and workers. And please answer yes or no. Starting again with Mr. Scharf, will you eliminate all forced arbitration clauses which take away a consumer's choice on how best to pursue justice with a bank? Yes or no. Mr. Scharf. No. Chairman Brown. Mr. Moynihan. Mr. Moynihan. For bank products we eliminated it many years ago. Chairman Brown. Mr. Dimon. Mr. Dimon. No. Chairman Brown. Ms. Fraser. Ms. Fraser. No. Chairman Brown. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Rogers. We allow consumers of our new products to opt out of arbitration. Chairman Brown. Mr. Cerere. Mr. Cecere. No. Chairman Brown. Mr. Demchak. Mr. Demchak. We allow consumers to opt out. Chairman Brown. Raise your hands if you are committed to fighting against discrimination? [Show of hands.] Chairman Brown. Thank you. Thus, therefore, I think I can count on your support, right, for the Fair Access to Financial Services Act, which would prohibit banks and other financial institutions from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, the Fair access to Financial Services Act. Mr. Scharf, will you support it? Mr. Scharf. I do not know the specifics of it, but the things you mentioned, absolutely. Chairman Brown. Mr. Moynihan? Mr. Moynihan. The principles we already regulate to but I do not know the specifics of the act. Chairman Brown. Mr. Dimon? Mr. Dimon. Exactly the same position. Chairman Brown. Ms. Fraser? Ms. Fraser. Yes, the same position. We do not know the specifics but we endorse the principles. Chairman Brown. Mr. Rogers? Mr. Rogers. We endorse the principles you just outlined, but I am not aware of the specifics of that act. Mr. Cecere. Consistent, Chairman. We endorse the principles as well, and I do not know the specifics. Chairman Brown. Mr. Demchak? Mr. Demchak. The same. Thank you. Chairman Brown. OK. I think you all have really good staff, and I would have thought you would know more about a bill like that before you come in front of the Committee, but we will follow up. Next question. I will start from the right, Mr. Scharf, so you do not have to start this time. Mr. Denchak, is your bank opening unauthorized bank accounts? Mr. Demchak. I am sorry. Can you repeat that? Chairman Brown. Is your bank opening unauthorized bank accounts? Mr. Demchak. No. Chairman Brown. Mr. Cecere? Mr. Cecere. Chairman Brown, we regret, and I take full responsibility that we did open up unauthorized bank accounts. It is going back to 2010. It is unacceptable. It is inconsistent with our principles and procedures as well as our ethics. We identified 342 accounts over that time, and that is against a population of 40 million opened accounts. We took remediation, we took care of the customers, we corrected the credit polls, and we reimbursed any fees. We also made sure that we strengthen our policies and procedures back in 2016, and that plan is what we are consistently going to continue to do on a go-forward basis. Chairman Brown. And you will no longer open unauthorized accounts, I assume, for that answer? Mr. Cecere. That is not tolerated. Chairman Brown. Thank you. Mr. Rogers? Mr. Rogers. We do not tolerate the opening of unauthorized accounts, and we have extensive training policies with our teammates. Chairman Brown. Ms. Fraser? Ms. Fraser. We do not believe that we have opened any unauthorized accounts. Thank you. Chairman Brown. Mr. Dimon? Mr. Dimon. I certainly hope that we do not. We have procedures in place to stop it, and if someone violated those procedures they probably would not be at the company. Chairman Brown. Mr. Moynihan? Mr. Moynihan. We have procedures. There was a massive review done of all our banks in the mid-2010 to 2020 decade, and we run those procedures every day. Chairman Brown. Mr. Scharf? Mr. Scharf. We have made a host of changes from process to control to cultural changes to do everything to ensure that that does not happen. Chairman Brown. Thank you. Starting again with Mr. Denchak, will you commit today to fight fraud in the Zelle platform by giving your customers their money back? Yes or no. Mr. Demchak. We return money today for fraud. Scam is a different issue, and the Zelle network and the owners are working to improve--to get all customers' monies back. Chairman Brown. Mr. Cecere? Mr. Cecere. We also reimburse for fraud and unauthorized transactions, and we are working hard to work with our customers to educate them on scam issues. Chairman Brown. Understanding that people listening that with the exception of one of you, you are the owners of Zelle. Mr. Rogers? Mr. Rogers. We reimburse for unauthorized, and we will work together, and we do a lot of education for our clients to help avoid criminal activity. Chairman Brown. Ms. Fraser? Ms. Fraser. Fraud is obviously a top concern for us. We take it seriously. We reimburse the unauthorized transactions. Chairman Brown. Mr. Dimon? Mr. Dimon. We reimburse unauthorized, and we take a lot of activities to make sure that authorized transactions are not scams. Chairman Brown. Mr. Moynihan? Mr. Moynihan. We reimburse today for unauthorized transactions, and like Mr. Dimon said, we send out notices and everything to avoid---- Chairman Brown. Mr. Scharf? Mr. Scharf. We also reimburse for unauthorized transactions, and we, as a company, and certainly across EWS, we are all working toward reducing scam, to try and drive it out of the systems. Chairman Brown. OK. Last question in my remaining 20 seconds or so. Yes-or-no question. I asked this question last year. Will you remain neutral if your employees try to unionize? Mr. Scharf? Mr. Scharf. We believe that we should have a direct relationship with our employees. No. Chairman Brown. Mr. Moynihan? Mr. Moynihan. We will operate as far as shareholders, our customers, and employees within what the law allows us to do. Chairman Brown. Mr. Dimon? Mr. Dimon. No. Chairman Brown. Ms. Fraser? Ms. Fraser. We will not commit to being neutral. Chairman Brown. Mr. Rogers? Mr. Rogers. We will not obstruct any activity, but we cannot be neutral to the benefits of Truist and what we offer. Chairman Brown. Mr. Cecere? Mr. Cecere. We will not retaliate. We will continue and expect to be close to our employees, but we will abide by the law. Chairman Brown. Mr. Demchak, from the union town of Pittsburgh? [Laughter.] Chairman Brown. That was a little bit of dig---- Mr. Demchak. No, we would not obstruct, but of course, I would be in conversations with our customers about it. So yes, we would be involved. Chairman Brown. And the last statement. I will ask you, if I had more time, about supporting the child tax credit. You have often come in front of us talking about tax reform, and the child tax credit meant a lot of money for those 6 months, those payments of the families of 2 million children in my State alone. It meant a lot of money in your accounts. And I would ask you, not in a question now, but to support the extension of the child tax credit and what it means. Senator Toomey. Senator Toomey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Dimon, I suppose you have been dealing with bank regulators for most of your adult life. Do you believe that the U.S. banking regulators have the statutory authority to determine how quickly America transitions to a low-carbon economy? Mr. Dimon. I do not. Senator Toomey. I do not either. Mr. Dimon. That is your authority. Senator Toomey. That is the way I see it. But here is one of my concerns. I am concerned about the enormous power that some of the regulators have, especially the Fed, and power that is exercised in an opaque fashion. And so my question is, I am not accusing anybody at the Fed of anything, but do they, as a practical matter, have the power that if they wanted to they could effectively pressure financial institutions into directing capital where they want it? Mr. Dimon. So speaking for myself, they are my judge, my jury, and my hangman. They pretty much can do what they want unless constrained by you. So yeah, if they wanted to come up with ways to do some of those things they could easily do that. Senator Toomey. Yeah. So one of the concerns that I have is the interest that some have to use the financial regulators, especially in the climate space. In Europe, of course, the ECB has broader authority than our Fed has, and they are pursuing this very aggressively. I worry that the Fed's decision to join the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System and the ongoing development of these climate risk scenario analyses are a precursor to regulatory edicts, or at least pressure to de-bank energy companies, and that would be exercising a power that they do not legally have. Let me move on to the issue of some of America's largest money managers. We know that these managers routinely vote the shares that they hold, including the shares they hold on behalf of their customers, and they do that including for those shares invested in passive index funds. With $22 trillion in assets and an average of 25 percent of the votes at S&P 500 company shareholder meetings, a handful of asset managers can have, it seems to me, a huge impact on companies' decisions. Mr. Rogers, let me ask you, do you agree that the largest asset managers are capable of exercising significant influence over public companies? Mr. Rogers. Ranking Member, thank you for that question, and we want to engage with all of our shareholders. We want to engage with them individually, the largest and the smallest shareholder today. And certainly those who own more shares have more influence. Senator Toomey. Well, so one of my concerns is that the largest asset managers in the country have joined the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, that explicitly states as its goal a ``stewardship and engagement strategy with a clear escalation and voting policy that is consistent with our ambition for all assets under management to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, or sooner.'' Here is the problem. These large asset managers have enormous sway by virtue of the volume of votes they can cast, even though they do not even really own many of those shares. And, of course, control, if that sway goes to the level of control, then there are significant ramifications, legal and regulatory, especially if that control is exercised over financial institutions. So I have my staff looking into this issue with the intent of producing a report on this later. Mr. Denchak, there are folks, including prominent regulators, who seem to believe that large regional banks, although not as big as G-SIBs, are already too big to be resolved in the event of a crisis, and therefore, they just have to be sold to one of the other banks represented at this table. Correct me if I am wrong. Is it true that your bank is required to submit a resolution plan to the Fed and the FDIC every 3 years? Mr. Demchak. Yes. We have done so for 10 years. Senator Toomey. OK. Did any of those plans that you submitted contemplate, as the sole resolution, a Government bailout or the wholesale sale to one of these other banks? Mr. Demchak. No. It is pretty easy to draw circles around our regions and sell them. Senator Toomey. Now the regulators are fully authorized to reject a submitted plan if they thought it was not credible or otherwise deficient. Have the regulators ever rejected your plan? Mr. Demchak. No. Senator Toomey. So it seems to me that the approval of your plan is at least a tacit admission that there is a credible resolution plan---- Mr. Demchak. Yes. Senator Toomey. ----that has been articulated. And so let me make a final point here. Some seem to think that additional regulation and added capital requirements, there is no cost, so why not? It seems to me that there is a cost of adding unnecessary capital requirements on already well-capitalized institutions. Could you share with us your perspective on what is the downside of having unnecessarily high capital requirements? Mr. Demchak. Well, in this instance it would crowd out other financings that are needed in the market. It is also making it more expensive and difficult for us to lend at a time when our country needs it. The cost of capital went up. Funds are being used for something other than supporting our economy. It does not make sense to me. Senator Toomey. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Toomey. Senator Reed, from Rhode Island, is recognized. Senator Reed. Thank you very much, and I want to thank the panel for your excellent testimony. Yesterday the Federal Reserve announced another three-and- a-quarter percent increase in the interest rate to 3.25 percent, and with these higher interest rates obviously the industry has collected--all right. I will get closer. All right. Let us begin again. Thank you for being here. Interest rates are going up. I will cut to the chase. Interest rates are going up, but deposit rates, what you pay for your deposits are rarely stagnant, very, very low. And it raises the question, making a substantial amount of money on these increased rates, why are you not beginning to raise interest rates on deposits? And I will start with Mr. Scharf and go down. Mr. Scharf. Senator, thank you for the question. We are beginning to raise rates. We have products that have a range of alternatives, I think up to a peak of 1.5 percent as of the other day. And as rates continue to rise we would expect to continue to increase the rates that we pay our customers. Senator Reed. Mr. Moynihan? Mr. Moynihan. The rates are already increasing on deposit accounts, and that will take place as the rate structure settles in. You can look back in history and see it. And then on top of that, remember that for corporates and affluent clients, they will go and buy treasures and other things direct, so their money is moving outside the system. And so if you spot-judge it now you will see a low rate structure. It will increase over time. And then people forget zero-interest checking accounts, or zero-interest, in any rate, environment, that is what changes the rate calculation that many people cite. Senator Reed. Mr. Dimon? Mr. Dimon. Exactly the same as my two colleagues here. Senator Reed. Thank you. Ms. Fraser? Ms. Fraser. Yes. We have a broad range of different deposit products, and we are anticipating a continued rise in the deposit rate. Senator Reed. Mr. Rogers? Mr. Rogers. We are anticipating that we would have an increase in our rates on our deposit products. We have a wide range of products, and we also offer a lot of services other than rate paid to our clients. We want to make sure that we continue to focus on those as well. Mr. Cecere. Consistent with that answer, Senator, we offer a wide range of rates, and I would expect them to increase in the future. Senator Reed. And finally, Mr. Demchak? Mr. Demchak. Senator, it is an incredibly competitive market. We have raised rates. Rates will continue to go up in line with what the Fed is doing. Senator Reed. Well thank you. I want to go back to something that we talked about last year, and that is the legislation that Chairman Brown and I submitted that would establish a nationwide 36 percent interest rate cap. Our goal is, frankly, to eliminate, if we can, predatory lending. I think even in this rising interest rate environment you have been able to make substantial profits without even approaching 36 percent interest rate. So I think the number is a valid one. As you know, we already have that protection for service men and women through the Defense Department and the efforts we have done with the Military Lending Act. Last year, when I brought up the issue, there was a consideration that the principle was sound but you had to look at it. You have had a year to look at it, so would you be able to operate successfully under a 36 percent interest rate, and as such, would you support this legislation? And I will begin with Mr. Scharf. Mr. Scharf. Senator, we still continue to believe that what you are trying to solve for is something that we should be supportive of, and we would just want to make sure that in whatever legislation was prepared there was contemplation of all the rate scenarios, to ensure that this did not result in the reduction of credit in any way for the population you are trying to help. Senator Reed. Mr. Moynihan? Mr. Moynihan. Senator, similar to my colleague, at the end of the day this is really relevant to our company in terms of rate structure and things. But I would always caution to be careful what you wish for. If you do this outside our industry and other places, does it constrain credit? And I think that is a judgment that you all have to make. But in terms of just a simple number, you know, it is not relevant to us. We do not have anything like that. Mr. Dimon. Yeah, Senator, I totally applaud the effort to stop payday lenders, and I think we should try to do things like that. And I think in certain products and services, 36 percent absolutely works. I just want to give you one example. If we modify it, you can make it work. A lot of you want to do small loans for 3 months, 4 months. So a $400 loan, for 4 months, 3 months, it will cost us $40 just to process the loan, no interest rate. But because the $40 cost goes into the APR, that would come out as 40 percent. So if we changed it to the marginal cost of processing a loan plus 12 percent, we would definitely be willing to do something like that to help customers. Senator Reed. Thank you. Ma'am? Ms. Fraser. Similarly, we do not charge 36 percent interest rates and completely agree with the principle of the legislation. As my colleague said, the details matter, and we want to make sure that there are not areas that would inadvertently constrain credit, particularly to the more LMI borrowers. And I am always very happy to work with your office to help achieve the spirit of the legislation. Senator Reed. And my time has expired, so a very short answer. Mr. Rogers. We would certainly look at the legislation, and I would have the same concerns about small-dollar lending, to make sure that stays within the banking system. And anything that discourages it, to leave the banking system, we would be against. Mr. Cecere. Short-term cash needs are an important priority. Four years ago, working with our regulators, we developed our simple loan product, which offers the structure that is well below $50 for the average loan versus $350 for payday lenders. Mr. Demchak. I do not have anything new to add. Senator Reed. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Reed. Senator Scott, of South Carolina, is recognized. Senator Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will perhaps start with Mr. Dimon, a question on inflation. For the last 17 months we have seen inflation higher than wage growth, which means that the average person's spending power is going down, not up. In the last 6 months we have seen inflation over 8 percent. Fast-forwarding another 6 to 12 months, where are we and why? Mr. Dimon. The economy is facing some very tough things, OK. We have a strong U.S. consumer. They are spending money. Still 10 percent over last year, 35 percent over the prior year. Their checking accounts are in better shape. Their balance sheets are in better shape. Their debt service ratio is actually almost at historical lows. Obviously it is being eroded by inflation, and that is kind of current. Now future, not that far away, you have QT, rising rates, you know, more inflation, war in Ukraine which is deteriorating oil price, which I still think are kind of precarious, and yeah, those things have the potential to put the country and the world into a recession, which will obviously help inflation but it is not the preferred way to get there. The worst outcome is stagflation, so conquering inflation is a very important thing to do. Senator Scott. So when I look at the credit card balances, they are going up, not down. The challenges for small businesses finding employees is worse, not better. The truth is that in many ways our economy is looking at some really strong headwinds. We would hope that the worst is in the rear-view mirror, but truly perhaps it is in the windshield. And I just wonder, as we think about the stress tests and trying to break this down for the average person at home, listening to a banking hearing--I am not sure why they would be listening, but just in case they are--the question I ask myself is, we have these conversations about capital requirements going up, which means that loans will go down and inflation still is heading in the wrong direction. Finding employees is harder than it was. Having been a small business owner, that formula looks like a first-time business owner, minority business owners, are going to have a harder time getting the credit they need to grow and strengthen the economy in their neighborhoods. Am I wrong when you add all that together? Mr. Dimon. I think there are capital requirements which are causing us to reduce lending right now to buildup capital because of a recent stress test, which I thought was completely unnecessary. So you are not wrong. Senator Scott. The stress test actually proved that you all are in a healthier position than you have ever been in. Therefore, increasing the capital requirements that reduces loans might have the unintended, perverse consequence for small business owners trying to figure out how to bring more opportunities to their communities. Is that accurate, Ms. Fraser? Mr. Dimon. Seems abnormal to me, yeah. Ms. Fraser. Yes, that seems a possible outcome. Senator Scott. Does anyone disagree with that? So me it seems like, and the solution is if our stress test and the challenges that we are putting our banks through in order to make sure that they are healthy enough to endure a pandemic or 2008, should suggest if we want more lending for more business startups then we would be heading, according to Vice Chairman Barr's comments, we would be heading in the wrong direction. Thoughts? I love when you guys are silent. It says so much. Mr. Demchak. Senator, if I may, there are two things that have changed over the last few years. One is the CECL accounting standard, which causes banks to have to reserve for the life of the loan potential losses. As we go into a slower economic period, which I believe we are going to go into, it is going to cause banks to reserve and pull money off the table, at the same time as we are raising capital requirements which is also going to pull money off the table. So effectively we are procyclical in the potential downturn that we are going to face here from those two effects. Senator Scott. And let me just wrap up my thoughts so that we can go on to another colleague with this simple synopsis. All that we have talked about makes it harder for the average person in our country to grow their confidence in our institutions, number one. Number two, there is probably, according to the numbers, about 5.4 percent of 7 million Americans who are unbanked. The whole concept of financial inclusion gets harder, not easier. In the current environment as we go through weathering more storms, those unbanked may not look positively on a system that they do not understand anyway in that the rates are going up and the loans are going down. I think this is a very frustrating time for Americans who are looking for a chance to achieve the American dream, to achieve that dream. I just wonder if we are not doing more harm than good as it relates to the environment that is not consistent with the average person wanting to lean into opportunity in a time that we need more people getting capital off the sidelines and into the market. Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Scott. Senator Menendez, of New Jersey, is recognized. Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A 2021 report by the Financial Health Network found that nearly 60 percent of all overdraft fees in 2020 were paid by low- and moderate-income households, and about 25 percent were paid by Latino households specifically. Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Scharf, Mr. Dimon, your banks each charged over $1 billion in overdraft fees last year, and while each of your banks have recently reduced or modified the fees, your customers, particularly your low-income and minority customers, are still at risk of incurring an overdraft fee every time they make a payment from one of your banks. So can you commit to us today that before we see you next year your institutions will fully eliminate overdraft fees? Mr. Scharf. Senator, we have an account that has no overdraft fees available for our customers, and we believe that the customer should have a choice of the way they want their services and the way they want to pay for them at the company. Mr. Moynihan. Senator, if you look at the last quarter call report you will see that the overdraft fees in our company dropped 66 percent from last year. Recently we announced that they will drop further because during that quarter we made some of these changes. We do not believe the full elimination of them is actually a good result, but the amount of overdraft fees we will collect we have told people will be down 90 percent. That is a 12- to 13-year commitment that we have been able to live up to because we are big and because we have the operating costs and because we are allowed to do mergers and put together a great franchise. It allows us to pass those benefits through to the customers. So eliminating, I think, has attributes which are different than people say, which the rep payment could be rejected, but we reduced the cost to $10 on those instances. We also have 4 million people in a no-overdraft account, and it is open to 25, 30 percent of all of the new accounts. So I think you have to look at---- Senator Menendez. That requires certain standards to have a no-overdraft account. Mr. Moynihan. No. Five dollars a month. I mean, anybody can open it that has an ID, yes. Senator Menendez. Mr. Dimon? Mr. Dimon. Yeah, we also offer it, which I think is the right thing to do. Twenty-three percent opt in, so it is not like everyone wants it, but those who want it, sometimes it is abused. But there are two sides to this, which are very critical. First, I have faith in the American public to make their own choices. When people use it, remember there are a lot of occasions where if it is not used they will be charged a higher fee on the other side. That includes parking tickets, rent, mortgages, or you need pharmacies immediately and you get bounced. So people want it for those reasons, and it can often reduce the cost on the other side and stop them from going to payday lenders. So that is why we are trying to navigate this. I do agree with the concept. It does get overused, and we try to do things like financial counseling, and on occasion just turn it off for someone because we think they just use it too much. Senator Menendez. I have faith in the American people as you do, Mr. Dimon. I do not think that their choice is to end up in overdrafts. Your banks made $64 billion, collectively, last quarter--$64 billion. So it is clear to me that there is no reasonable explanation to continue to charge overdraft fees on working families. You just had a conversation with my colleague and friend, Senator Scott. One of the reasons so many Americans are still hesitant to enter the formal financial system is this issue. I hope you will give more consideration to how you deal with this overdraft issue. I think it would inure to everybody's benefit. I have heard story after story from New Jersey constituents who have fallen victim to scams and frauds in Zelle, and in many instances the banks have denied their customers relief. That is why in July I led a letter, with some of my colleagues, to seven of the banks that created and jointly own Zelle, which includes most of you. I found several of your responses really inadequate. In particular the responses from JPMorgan Chase and PNC did not address the fundamental questions we asked regarding the number of frauds and scams reported by your customers as well as information regarding refunds and referrals to law enforcement. So Mr. Dimon and Mr. Demchak, will you commit to making the information we asked available to me and my staff as your other colleagues have? Mr. Dimon. Absolutely, and I am sorry we did not meet it the first time. Mr. Demchak. Yes, the same. I am sorry we did not send it in the first instance. Senator Menendez. I appreciate it because that information helps us as we are trying to figure out that consumers are slipping through the cracks of Regulation E, and detailed information will help us figure out what we do with it. Finally, Mr. Scharf, in March Bloomberg reported that Wells Fargo disproportionately rejected refinancing applications from African American and Hispanic homeowners. You and I had an opportunity, and I appreciate your visit. One of the things that you told me in response to my questions was this was partially due to the fact that Wells encourages more minority borrowers to go through the full application process, while some of your competitors turn them away at an earlier stage. Is that correct? Mr. Scharf. Just one clarification, is we encourage all borrowers, not just minority borrowers. Senator Menendez. OK. But that would include the whole universe of minority borrowers, therefore. Why do not the rest of you do the same, encourage them to go through the full application process? OK. The silence is---- Mr. Demchak. To be fair, I just do not know if we do or do not, but we will look at that. Senator Menendez. Would you respond to us for the record please? Because look, the Latino community has a $2 trillion domestic marketplace impact already. It will grow exponentially. But it needs to be treated fairly in the process. And Ms. Fraser, it is good to see you because this is about the only diversity we have in this industry. Thank you. Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Menendez. Senator Kennedy, from Louisiana, is recognized. Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You are all American companies, and I am very proud of that. And I thank you for that and I congratulate you on your success. It seems to me that your institutions are a lot like America. You are not perfect but you are good. Capitalism works. That is why America has the strongest economy in all of human history. Capitalism has done more to lift people out of poverty than all the social programs put together. The poverty rate in our country is 3 percent. Now the Census Bureau will tell you it is 12 percent, but the Census Bureau only counts cash payments, not in-kind payments. The Census Bureau does not count Medicaid. It does not count food stamps. It does not count the earned income tax credit. If you count all of those, all those programs, our poverty rate is 3 percent. And that money to help our neighbors who are less fortunate than we are did not come from leprechauns. It came from the American people and their generosity, and they have that money because of capitalism. Number two. I am not going to ask you to comment on this. Senator Toomey touched on it. You will never win, never, the uber-woke sweepstakes. I understand that the pressure to run that race is fierce. You will never win it. Nothing you do will ever be enough. The uber-woke people in positions of power in this town think America was evil when it was founded and it is even more evil today. You are not going to convince them otherwise. I believe that you are not free if you cannot say what you think. I encourage you to do that. I believe that you are not free if you cannot express yourself. You have your opinion. Be candid. Do not try to win the uber-woke sweepstakes. Number three. I do not like to brag about the expensive places I have been, but the night before last I went to the grocery store. Inflation is gutting the American people like a fish. Now we know what our Federal Reserve is doing on the monetary side. I want to ask you what you think we should do-- ``we'' meaning the Federal Government--on the fiscal side. And if you could just give me direct answers because I only have about a minute and a quarter, though I might ask for a little extra time with the indulgence of the Chairman. Ms. Fraser, tell me what you think we should do on the fiscal side to help curtail inflation? Ms. Fraser. There is a considerable amount of savings still in the system. We do not believe that we need more additional stimulus being put through into the economy, and therefore making sure that we are supporting those that are suffering from the high prices and what is likely to be a very challenging year ahead, but that support is directed to them. Senator Kennedy. Mr. Dimon? Mr. Dimon. Yeah, I think a little less fiscal spending would be good because we had 30 percent of GDP spent over a 2- year period, which is literally unprecedented. But I also think on the supply side, taxation, immigration, regulation, health care, infrastructure, this permitting bill, if you did some of those things you will help grow the economy to reduce inflation. Senator Kennedy. Would a tax cut be out of the question for you? Mr. Dimon. I would say calibrate taxes so that you create more growth. Senator Kennedy. How about get a little Government off the backs of the American people in terms of regulation? Mr. Dimon. That would be helpful, I think, particularly for small business. I do not want to sit here and complain about big companies, but I urge everyone to take ten small businesses out to lunch and ask them what it like to live through Federal, State, and local regulations, even if they have one store, and that could help a lot. Senator Kennedy. I am sorry we do not have more time. Thank you all for being here. Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Senator Tester, of Montana, is recognized. Senator Tester. Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is always good following Senator Kennedy. It is always a pleasure. You are right. Capitalism works if there is competition, and in the meat industry right now there is not any competition, and the reason you got hooked going to the grocery store is because those packers are making bank--no pun intended. And so I look forward to your---- Senator Kennedy. I am with you, Senator. We both love meat. Senator Tester. All right. Right on, baby. Senator Kennedy. Right on. [Laughter.] Senator Tester. My special investigator bill to enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act, but I am here to talk to you guys, and ma'am, and I want to thank you all for being here, and I want to thank you for your testimony. I come from a very rural area in a very rural State, and as you guys know better than anybody, access to capital is critical important if you are going to have business expansion and employment and economic growth. It was a few years ago in my small town of 600, the bank, one of your banks actually, decided to pull out. Fortunately we had a community bank come in and they are doing a great job. But that potential pullout and that access to that brick-and- mortar facility could have really raised heck with my little, small town, where post offices are still important and schools are still important and banks are still important. So this question is for all of you. Are you guys committed to brick-and-mortar facilities in rural America, and if you are not, why not? We can start with you, Mr. Scharf. Mr. Scharf. Senator, thank you. I think you know this. We are, I think, the biggest of the banks here in terms of our presence in rural America. We very much are committed to continuing that. To the extent that we have exited a location we have tried to be very, very conscious of ensuring that we are not leaving the town unbanked, whether that be through having another bank there or working with another bank to take over our facility. But we do view the fact that we are so big in rural America as something that is important, and we need to make sure we continue. Senator Tester. Go ahead. Just go right down the line. Mr. Moynihan. Mr. Moynihan. Our branches are in the market, 90-odd markets we serve, plus extended beyond that, 150 to 200 markets, and we will continue to be there. I would tell you that back earlier in 2011 or 2012, we sold a bunch of our branches to smaller community banks to make them stronger, 400 branches in the rural areas we served--we were not in your State but in other States--with that exact idea in mind, which is the town or city needed banking, and if you sold the deposits to another community bank it would be helpful. Senator Tester. OK. Mr. Dimon. Mr. Dimon. I am so proud that we are now in 48 States. We have opened branches in North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, North Carolina, South Carolina, Montana, Billings, Bozeman. I think we are doing Ennis, and we will take a look at your little town. Senator Tester. OK. Ms. Fraser. Thank you for the question, Senator. We are a bank that has a smaller retail footprint in the States. We have a larger focus on corporate clients than on the retail clients. I would certainly commit that we will be doing our best to support the Montana enterprises. Mr. Rogers. We have long been committee to rural markets. I believe our bank as a percent of branches has the most in rural markets. But in additional to rural markets also important, they are also digital deserts. So we are also committed to focusing on areas such as broadband to make sure that we can serve those markets, not only physically but equally digitally. Mr. Cecere. Senator, as you know we are a large player in rural markets, North and South Dakota as well as Montana, and most cities in Montana. We also have large operation centers in some of those rural markets to provide jobs. Senator Tester. OK. Mr. Demchak. Mr. Demchak. We have grown our presence in rural markets over the last several years and we have augmented that with a fleet of mobile branches that can cover multiple small towns in the same day. Senator Tester. OK. I have got limited time, and this is a more complex question, but you guys all know the threats of cyber out there. You know that you are probably being attacked as we speak right now by a cyberattack of some sort. We need to continue to adapt and work to combat these evil threats. And so I am just going to pick Mr. Rogers and Mr. Dimon. How do your companies ensure that you are devoting adequate resources to cyber threats? Mr. Rogers. One of the reasons, Senator, we merged was to create more capacity to protect our clients and our company against cyber threats. So we do a variety of things. One of the things we do is we bring in third parties to help us. We bring in third parties to look at our systems, attack our systems, to do horizontal reviews about where we are relative to others, to make sure that our defense are as strong as they can be, to secure our clients' data. And then we also participate in all the efforts that our regulatory bodies undertake as it relates to cybersecurity. Senator Tester. Mr. Dimon? Mr. Dimon. Yeah, we spend several million a year. Everything we do goes through cyber reviews and cyber checks. We do oversight on third parties. Every time you access our systems it is running through multiple cyber type of things. We have worked with the Federal Government, the Governments in Europe. It is a nonstop battle. My board reviews it. We will do anything we can. I put this way up there, right behind competition with China and this war in Ukraine. Cyber risks are extraordinary. Senator Tester. Yeah. Thank you all for being here. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Tester. Senator Lummis, of Wyoming, is recognized. Senator Lummis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being here. This a bit of a flogging element to what is happening today, but there is also an opportunity for us to learn from each other, so I hope that you will provide that when I ask questions of you. And I want to thank Senator Kennedy for pointing out that America is the leader in world financial services. But that said, it is a privilege, and there are other countries that are working at a transformative pace in innovation. So having China come up at the conclusion of Mr. Tester's conversations with you, I want to start with that issue. Mr. Dimon, I want to ask you about a comment you made last month. You said, ``China looks at America and they say, `you have been incompetent and lazy.' '' And then you said, ``There is some truth to that.'' So I too am concerned that too many in the financial services industry have been lazy, and they do not see the transformative pace at which the rest of the world is innovating. Payments technology, for example, is far too slow and costly. So your bank is currently testing JPM coin, it is a type of stablecoin, for faster settlement. Could you talk a little bit about our duty to responsibly innovate, to stay a world leader? Same question to Mr. Cecere. Mr. Dimon. Yeah. America already is the world innovator and world leader, and China is a serious competitive, strategic issue we all have to deal with. And so I totally agree with that. I do not think Americans should be embarrassed. I mean, we still have the most prosperous Nation on the plant, all the food and energy we need, free enterprise, the gifts of God, the gifts of our Founding Fathers. They have autocracy, not enough food or energy. They need 15 million barrels of oil a day. They get 4 for themselves or their immediate neighbors, stuff like that. We are in very good shape. The lazy part, talking about policy, is things we got wrong where we could have done better--immigration, taxation, regulation, health care, litigation, all those things. I think it has slowed down America, and I think we should all be focusing more on how can we grow more and create more, wealthier, afford more in the military, et cetera, et cetera. And innovation and cryptocurrency, they are probably ahead in a couple of areas, and I think we should recognize that and combat that. I am not really worried about it as long as we get our act together. Senator Lummis. Mr. Cecere? Mr. Cecere. I agree. I think one particular area of innovation that is critically important is money movement and payments activity, and I think the banks are working together with each other as well as our regulators on activities like real-time payments, Zelle, even FedNow. All those things I think will position us well for future payments activity. Senator Lummis. Anyone else want to weigh in on this? Mr. Moynihan. I think our colleague spoke to it, but the real-time payment system, the ability to get a 24/7 wire system at the Fed would be critical to it, and their new real-time system ought to provide that. But one of the disadvantages in payment system technology is the ability to pay on the weekends and move a substantial amount of money that actually clears. T-plus-zero security settlement would be doable if you actually could have the money move during the night. So I think we are all aware of that. We have connected our real-time payment system. We are connecting it to other parts of the world that we have put together through the clearing house. That ought to enable money to move real-time. You connect that with Zelle and things, you can move it with no cost to another banking client, as long as someone does not step in and say, oh, that is not sufficient to have sent to there in Spain. You do the KYC so we can rely on it. We need some enabling things, and I think if we do that right you will see the innovation that is already set up and already moving. And by the way, we move trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars a day very efficiently. So I think people's view of what is inefficient is kind of interesting, but you have to look at what really moves. Senator Lummis. Well, we are aware that money was transferred in cryptocurrency as donations to Ukraine. They were spending it the next day. And if it had been transferred in U.S. dollars it would have taken about 10 days for it to reach--I see some of you shaking your heads. Disagree, Mr. Dimon? Mr. Dimon. Right now we are moving $10 trillion around the world, zipping and zapping through AML systems, OFAC systems, regulations, AI systems, cyber system, safely and immediately. A lot of is real time. You are talking about retail payments. Senator Lummis. Yes, I am. Mr. Dimon. Yes, and I agree with that. That is a thing that we all can work on and fix. But that is a very small thing relative to the other. Senator Lummis. Thank you for being here. I yield back. Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Lummis. Senator Warner, from Virginia, is recognized. Senator Warner. Well thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is good to see all of you. I am reflecting back on the fact that I first got here in the middle of the meltdown in 2009, and I think Mr. Dimon and Mr. Moynihan were on the panel. Everybody else has changed. So maybe your turnover rate is even higher than the turnover rate on the panel up on this side. I am not sure what it says about Brian and Jamie. The first question I want to get to CDFIs, MDIs, something I have talked to you all about over the years. Clearly during COVID we saw, as effective as some of our programs were, minority, low-income businesses got left out. I am very proud of the fact that we worked in a bipartisan way with a lot of Members on this Committee. I want to give a shout-out to Mike Crapo, where we got $12 billion to CDFIs and MDIs, $3 billion in loan, and I was just on the line yesterday with the Vice President, about $9 billion in tier one capital. My concern, though, is we have got to do more. There was a public-private initiative that some of you are participating in, Economic Opportunity Council, to try to shore up access to capital issues for LMI borrowers. So I am going to start, as one of the new guys on the panel, Mr. Rogers. What can we do--what can you all do, as the largest institutions in the country, to help shore up CDFIs and MDIs? Clearly the Community Reinvestment Act reforms, in fact, I have got some ideas about nudging you to get some CRA credit to help CDFIs and MDIs, but I would like you to speak to that. Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Senator, and thank you for your focus on CDFIs. I think the private and public cooperation has put a lot of capital into CDFIs and I think that is actually great, great for the country and great for the expansion of our economy. In spending a lot of time with CDFIs and spending a lot of time with the recipients of the CDFIs, I think they are now starting to prioritize revenue versus capital, as how can you help us get business. So I think the areas where we can support CDFIs more are the areas that we do in things like supplier diversity. Let us make sure that we are including more people in the diversity. Let us make sure that they are getting revenue to go along with that capital so they can use that capital and deploy it efficiently. I think we can play an important role that. Senator Warner. I have got a second question. Does anybody else want to lean in on this, because I am going to be back to you with specific requests in this space. I am going to say, for Mr. Dimon and Ms. Fraser, I got the next question. But does anybody want to weigh in here on CDFIs and MDIs? Mr. Moynihan. I think, Senator, just generally, this group of banks has done a lot with the CDFIs and MDIs, sometimes a little different flavor of ice cream but we all have major deposits with them. A lot of put equity into to them. Some put preferred stock into them. But there are cooperating agreements, ATM access, et cetera, that allows them to have access to our scale in different ways. And beyond that we just did an innovative program where we gave them a certain amount of money just to go to community medical centers, to extend medical centers. So I think we are all getting very creative in asking them what they need from us, and I think you have seen the---- Senator Warner. I do think we need some additional help in terms of back-office operations. Mr. Moynihan. Yeah, I think there are elements like that. Senator Warner. Let me get to my next question. I mentioned the fact that my first time up here with you guys was in the midst of the financial crisis in 2009. We had seen an overheated real estate market. We had seen a series of things that had kind of gone unobserved. Yet we are now, I fear, at times we have got a whole section of a nonbanked, nonregulated financial market, and this will sound like a little bit of a lay-up to you all. But the percentage of mortgages being originated on a non-banked basis. We are talking about a number of consumer products. I think some of the old ideas around OCC charters or CFPB charters, I think they may need a new look. And I will start with Ms. Fraser and Mr. Dimon, and I will be anxious to hear, Mr. Dimon, your comments because you made these comments against regulations, so you think it is a good idea that this whole non-banked sector competes with you guys with no regulatory oversight at all? Mr. Dimon. I have never been against regulations. I think we need proper and properly calibrated regulations. You can always improve and enhance. You know, sometimes they go too far and sometimes it was not enough. That is totally true, and I have given credit to parts of Dodd-Frank. You know, Lehman Brothers would not happen again. But if you look at some of these things--and this is an honest assessment, not a complaint--there are a lot of these folks that do not have social requirements, FDIC requirements, transparency requirements, they do not have regulatory type requirements, AML requirements, BSA requirements, same kind of cyber requirements. That is your decision. We will deal with whatever you all and the regulators decide. And so it has driven a lot of stuff outside of banking, which is fine. We can deal with it. I am not sure it is the right policy for the United States, particularly around mortgages. Senator Warner. Although I would also quickly say, you know, and I think some of us on my side of the aisle need to maybe revisit this in terms of concerns about watered-down charters versus no regulatory oversight at all. I think we have got to figure out how we pick our poison here. Ms. Fraser? Ms. Fraser. The balance is very important. The U.S. financial system is one of the great assets of the country. It is the envy of the world, and strong financial institutions is important. Part of that is a rigorous and fair and effective regulatory structure and framework, and one in which the same activity has the same regulation as opposed to the entity being regulated. I think the strength of the system here in the States should be around the same activity having the same regulation. Senator Warner. I do think we are going to need them, particularly, Mr. Chairman, on some of these innovative new financial products, because most customers do not care whether it is a bank or another entity. We are going to need some consumer protections. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Brown. Senator Tillis is next. Senator Cramer, from North Dakota, is recognized. Thank you, Senator Warner. Senator Cramer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Toomey, and all of our panelists. First of all, I want to apologize for Senator Scott's implication that this is not interesting to all Americans. I think it is a pay-per-view event. This has been very good, particularly when Senator Kennedy started asking questions. That said, I also want to thank you all, and by the way, all of your colleagues at every level of banking, for delivering so well during the pandemic. We were building an airplane while flying it, and I think that you all did very well in delivering the services and the products at a time when American desperately needed it. Frankly, I think it built the foundation that is saving us today, so thank you for that. But I also want to join Senator Kennedy in this admonition. Please resist the impulse to respond to the very loud noise in your left ears. I am happy to be the loud noise in your right ear. When it comes to being one of the cool crowd I know the pressure that you feel, and I am sorry that sometimes those of us on the conservative side are not as activist oriented. But I want to help you. And this has not come up so I am going to bring it up. Last evening I led a letter, that was signed by nearly all of the Republicans on this dais, to the Bank Policy Institute, and you are all, of course, members, regarding this new merchant category code that is for gun and ammunition stores. And I want to be clear about who did this. You know, the credit card companies are taking a lot of heat, but it is the ISO that did it. It is the International Organization for Standardization, and they did it against the wishes of the credit card companies, who opposed it in the beginning, they voted against it on the advisory committee, their opposition was upheld, and then ISO did it anyway. And they did it at the urging of a very liberal, activist bank, Amalgamated Bank. And so I want to ask each of you, as the carriers, the acquirers, as the facilitators that are providing the capital, will you commit to me, can you commit in front of this Committee and the pay-per-view audience that is listening and watching, that your bank will process all transactions for the purchase of legal goods and services, and I might add, constitutionally protected goods? We will start with you, Mr. Scharf. Mr. Scharf. Senator, we are going to implement the rule that has to be implemented as a member of the network, and we are going to continue to process transactions as we do today. Mr. Moynihan. I agree with my colleague's comments. It will not change anything we do. Mr. Dimon. No, I totally agree, and we cannot be involved in telling the American citizens how their money will be used. That is not our job. Ms. Fraser. Similarly, Senator, we do not intend to use the code to limit or restrict the purchase of firearms by our customer base. Mr. Rogers. Senator, we do not intend to have any restrictions. Mr. Cecere. I agree with the comments. We will abide by the rule, but no restrictions. Mr. Demchak. We will not have restrictions. Senator Cramer. Thank you all. Good answers from all of you. I do want to come back to you, Ms. Fraser, just a little bit, because Citibank has, in particular, given me some pause, when your bank has voluntarily committed to restrict lending to firearm retail clients unless they meet your specific criteria, which in many cases exceeds the law. And I want just extra assurances that law-abiding gun purchasers across the country will not be discriminated against, using this merchant category code as a means to an end. Ms. Fraser. Senator, thank you for the question. We respect the Second Amendment. As I said, we do not intend to use the code to restrict or limit any purchases of firearm sales by our credit card customers. We do not do so today. We do believe in best practices, best practices for the retail sale of firearms, and that is the policy that we have had for a while now. Most retailers follow those best practices. Senator Cramer. I would say most gun owners do as well. The vast majority of them are very good people. Ms. Fraser. Indeed. Senator Cramer. So thank you for that. I am just going to wrap up by just inviting you all to follow in the footsteps of Mr. Moynihan. Come to North Dakota. I want to show you real progress in transitioning to a cleaner energy economy that utilizes not regulation but rather innovation and the great riches that God has given us, below, on top, and above the Earth. And with that I thank you and yield. Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Cramer. Senator Warren, of Massachusetts, is recognized. Senator Warren. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So six of the seven banks who are here today--Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Truist, U.S. Bank, and PNC-- jointly created and own the Nation's most popular peer-to-peer payment platform, Zelle. The banks market Zelle as, quote, ``fast, safe, and an easy way to spend money,'' end quote. That is only partly true. It is definitely fast--Zelle is fast--Zelle is easy, and they increase bank profit margins, but Zelle is not safe. Last year alone, Zelle users were defrauded out of about half-a-billion dollars, that we know of. Now you built the system, you profit from every transaction on the system, and you tell people that it is safe. But when someone is defrauded you claim that is the customer's problem. We do oversight on the Banking Committee, so I want to know exactly how big this problem is. In July, other Senators and I wrote to ask you how many fraudulent Zelle transactions your customers have reported since 2018. Only Mr. Rogers, of Truist, provided the data, 52,000 claims of fraud totaling $46 million. Thank you, Mr. Rogers, for being transparent. But the rest of you stonewalled. So today I get to ask you in person. Do I have any volunteers who want to go first and share the numbers that I asked for in July, or will I just pick volunteers? OK, Mr. Dimon, you represent the largest bank here today so let me start with you. You did not provide any of the information that we requested in our letter, none of it. So what I want to know is, is that because you do not keep track when your customers report fraudulent Zelle transactions, or is it because you do keep track and you know exactly how many fraudulent transactions have been reported and you want to keep that report a secret? Mr. Dimon. I deeply apologize that we did not give you the numbers you asked for. I am sure we responded. And we pay-- anything that is unauthorized we do cover. So you are really talking about authorized transactions that we have an enormous amount of systems to stop, and the amount of fraud relatively is very small for this free-of-charge service. Senator Warren. I very much appreciate that you are going to give the commercial for Zelle, but if I do not have the numbers I do not have any way to verify that. Mr. Dimon. You are going to get them immediately, OK? Senator Warren. Do you want to give me a ballpark right now? Mr. Dimon. I do not have the number in front of me. Senator Warren. Do you know generally? This is a serious problem that has been going on in this bank. Mr. Dimon. I will get you the number immediately. I do not want to make it up. Senator Warren. Well, I do not want you to make it up either, but I do not want you to wait another two-and-a-half months before I get to see--it is very simple data. Mr. Dimon. I promise you by the end of the day today you will get it. Senator Warren. Terrific. All right. We will get it by the end of the day, once nobody is here to talk about it. How about you, Mr. Scharf? Do you have numbers? Mr. Scharf. I do not here. I apologize for not getting to you, but we will get it to you immediately. Senator Warren. Does anybody here have numbers? Yes, Mr. Cecere. Good. Mr. Cecere. I apologize that we did not get you the numbers. We transact about $1.1 billion a month, 3 million transactions, 0.07 percent have fraud involved. Senator Warren. OK. I am sorry but that is not the number I asked for. The number I asked for is how many customer fraud claims have you received. Mr. Dimon wanted to say, well, we, the bank, are going to determine what we think is a fraud claim that we think should be reimbursed. What I need to see is I need to see the number coming in on the front end, and that is how many customers held up their hand, called the bank, and said, ``I have a fraud complaint with Zelle.'' It is not hard. I presume you guys collect this information. Mr. Cecere. We do. Senator Warren. What is your number. Mr. Cecere. 0.07 on fraud, 0.05 on customers raising their hand. Senator Warren. I am sorry. I just need a real number. How many customer complaints have you received to fraud on Zelle system since 2018? Mr. Cecere. I do not have that number in front of me but I will get it to you by the end of the day. Senator Warren. Anybody else? Mr. Demchak? Mr. Demchak. I know the percentages, 6 basis points of scams and fraud. Fraud is much less. Senator Warren. And you define it, right? Mr. Demchak. Total disputes are six basis points. Senator Warren. You know, what troubles me here is the one person who gave us numbers, the numbers are pretty alarming, and the overall numbers are enormous. We know of at least half- a-billion dollars in transactions. It may not seem like a lot of money to you, but to the person who just lost $450 it is a lot of money to them. So let me ask this the other way around. This would not be the same kind of problem if the banks stood behind the product. After all, you are the ones who invented it. You are the ones who made it work. You are the ones who profit off it. And then, when customers say, ``I have got a problem,'' you say, ``I am only going to reimburse a narrow slice of those who hold up their hands and say that they have been defrauded on the system.'' But we could fix that problem right now, in this Committee, if you would all be willing to say, or any of you would be willing to say if a customer is defrauded on Zelle and they come and complain to the bank, then the bank will make it good. Let us do this one by a show of hands. Who is willing to make that commitment to your customers? Mr. Demchak. Senator, we are working--the owners of EWS are actually working. We are a closed network owned by banks, so you are exactly correct that we have an ability to make a difference here, and we are working on answer to your question. We are in the throes of figuring it out. Now let me continue, please. Zelle is one of the P2P networks that you highlight. The others have 15 times the number of disputes coming in to our company that we have no ability to have insight---- Chairman Brown. Senator Warren---- Senator Warren. Mr. Demchak---- Chairman Brown. ----your time has expired. Senator Warren. Let me just finish here, if I can please. I just want to say on this, you tell me you are so much better than the others, and yet you have had two-and-a-half months to bring the data forward, and you have not produced any numbers on this. I am sorry, your credibility right now is riding at zero. Mr. Demchak. We will---- Chairman Brown. Senator Rounds---- Senator Warren. You created the perfect---- Chairman Brown. Senator Rounds---- Senator Warren. ----weapon for criminals---- Chairman Brown. Senator Warren---- Senator Warren. ----to use, and they have used it, and you have not stood behind your customers. Look, you are inviting---- Chairman Brown. Senator Warren, your time has expired. Senator Warren. ----come in and regulate this. Chairman Brown. Senator Rounds is recognized. Senator Rounds. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to follow up a little bit, the responses, or the discussion that has just attempted to be completed, and I would like to give each of you the opportunity here to perhaps clarify the situation. I think we are talking about Regulation E, which has to do with whether or not you have a fraudulent activity in which currently, under Regulation E, there are certain types in which your banks clearly would have a liability exposure. But the CFPB has suggested, and I think what Senator Warren was getting at, was to promote the need for CFPB or some other Government organization to get actively involved in demanding that you pick up additional liability exposures on what we call rather than a person-to-person but rather a me-to-me transactions, where someone is defrauded by a criminal who is out to get their money and they voluntarily decide that they are going to transact or move money from one location to another. Now based on that, if my assumption is correct, could I just quickly move down the line, and I will just start with Mr. Scharf. Is it your responsibility to make the decision or to reimburse an individual who voluntarily, even though it is under a scam, is it your responsibility to repay or to get in the middle of that transaction and make someone whole again? Mr. Scharf. Senator, I way I will answer the question is I think what one of my colleagues was trying to say, which is there a tremendous amount that we can do as owners of the network to drive down the ability for thieves to take advantage of the network. That is what we are working on. That is what we have to do, and at the same time we do that the education that we do with our customers, so that they do not put themselves in harm's way. And those two things should lead to the elimination of almost all of this fraud that exists. Senator Rounds. Thank you. Mr. Moynihan? Mr. Moynihan. Thank you, Senator, for clarifying that. On unauthorized transactions, you heard earlier that all of us reimburse. And then the rate of fraud claims, the broad claims, is in the low single digits basis points, which is lower than-- the same as it is for check. But when a person authorizes a transaction to a third party---- Senator Rounds. When you say that a lot of folks have to say, ``What are they talking about, low basis points?'' You are talking about a very small percent, less than 1 percent---- Mr. Moynihan. It is 99.98 I think would be the right math. Senator Rounds. 99.98 of clean transactions. Mr. Moynihan. There are no claims. Senator Rounds. OK. Mr. Moynihan. Now the other thing that you talked about is unauthorized we take care of. If a person sends money to someone--I think last quarter or month we sent out $800 million notices, ``Do you know this person that you are sending Zelle to?'' to try to stop what my colleague, Mr. Scharf, talked about, and we are all doing the same thing. And then the person still sends money to the person that promises to send them something. That is a difficult case. But we are working to make sure the receiver of that is disciplined and kept out of the system, and for that we have had multiple institutions who will not police their customer base not able to continue on Zelle. That is what we are working on. But if somebody says, ``I never authorized this,'' we take care of it. Senator Rounds. Thank you. Mr. Dimon? Mr. Dimon. Totally the same answer. We would love to solve this problem. I am sympathetic. No one wants these criminals and crooks. We would like to get them in jail. Keep in mind if you simply said that if you authorize a transaction, no matter what you would be repaid if you claim it is a scam, think of the problem of that, and that is why you cannot go all the way the other way either. Senator Rounds. Thank you. Ms. Fraser? Ms. Fraser. Thank you very much for the question. I think what you are hearing from all of us is that we take fraud very, very seriously. We do not want our customers to be defrauded. We will repay when there is an unauthorized transaction, and we put a lot of investment, all of us, into the tools and the capabilities to try and stop and prevent the fraud from happening in the first place, and to protect our customers. And it is a responsibility we all take very seriously. Senator Rounds. Thank you. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Rogers. Senator, thank you for your focus on this important issue, and similar to the others on this panel we do reimburse according to Regulation E. We reimburse way beyond that and focus in on our clients and try to take care of the challenges that they are facing. But as I said in my testimony, we also all need to focus on working together, a partnership--law enforcement, regulatory agencies--to actually catch the criminals who are perpetuating this fraud against our consumers. Senator Rounds. Thank you. Mr. Cecere? Mr. Cecere. I agree with everything that was said, and I think I would also say we are all working together to inform, educate, and help our customers in situations that may be fraud to help them understand those situations. Senator Rounds. Thank you. Mr. Demchak? Mr. Demchak. Thank you, Senator. I am sorry the other Senator left the room and did not hear the answers. We are focused on Zelle. Zelle is this big in terms of the fraud, and we need to fix it. The banks own it. These unregulated networks are this big, and that is where you need to help. We cannot do anything about that. We will fix Zelle. Senator Rounds. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time has expired. Chairman Brown. You are not wrong about that, Mr. Demchak. Senator Van Hollen, of Maryland, is recognized. Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank all of you for being here. I want to pick up a little bit on some of Senator Warner's question with respect to CDFIs and MDIs. As all of you know, the Congress, on a bipartisan basis, made a major commitment to these institutions back in December 2000, as part of the omnibus there. In fact, yesterday the Treasury Department just announced $86 million coming to Maryland institutions, CDFIs and MDIs. And I want to focus on some of the banks represented here that have the biggest footprint in the State of Maryland, and I am familiar, from our conversations, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Rogers, and Mr. Scharf, with what your banks are doing with respect to CDFIs and MDIs. I would just like to ask each of you for your continued commitment to these efforts in the State of Maryland, and beyond, but in the State of Maryland because I do think they play a vital role in economic empowerment. If I could just ask each of you to commit to continuing to work with us in Maryland. Mr. Scharf. Absolutely, Senator. Mr. Moynihan. You have our commitment, Senator. Mr. Rogers. Senator, thank you for your leadership on this, and we absolutely commit to continuing to support. Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. And I know Citi has also made some investments in CDFIs in Prince George's County, and others have too. Mr. Demchak, on PNC, we have not had a chance to talk about this. Could you talk a little bit, briefly, about what you are doing in Maryland with respect to CDFIs and MDIs? Mr. Demchak. In Maryland and across the country in markets we have been contributing capital, expertise, opening up ATM networks to MDIs, technology expertise, and we have been sending perhaps the most important thing as part of our Community Benefits Plan is we have been sending dedicated mortgage officers into the CDFIs to help support low-income housing. Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. No, I understand the broad efforts. I was looking at some of the banks that have a footprint, bigger footprint in Maryland, than some of the other. Mr. Demchak. We do as well, and we are there, and we put money into the CDFIs, and we support them. Senator Van Hollen. And we appreciate that. If you could just give me some information--not now--on what you are doing in Maryland. Mr. Demchak. Will do. Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. Let me get to the issue of overdraft fees. This seems to be an area where I know Citi announced in June that they are going to end their overdraft fees. Am I right about that? Ms. Fraser. Yes. We have eliminated our overdraft fees and NSFs. Senator Van Hollen. But you still do provide customers with some flexibility with respect to their payments? Ms. Fraser. Yes, we do. We provide the ability to overdraft, and we give them plenty of warning if they are going to be doing so, and the tools to manage their financial health and well-being. Senator Van Hollen. Got it. So I would just like to ask, I have been trying to review the policies with respect to overdrafts. I know everybody has been trying to make efforts here. I did notice that Wells Fargo generated $1.4 billion in overdraft revenue in 2021, JPMorgan Chase $1.2 billion. If I could just ask each of you whether you have plans to try to phaseout revenue from overdraft fees or whether this is an important part of your business model as you see it. Mr. Dimon? Mr. Dimon. You know, those fees are coming down dramatically because change was already implemented. Like you have got to go negative 50 before it gets charged. You have 24- hour recovery and grace period, advanced deposits and paychecks, et cetera. We think it is a service that clients want. So many people opt in. Seventy percent of the time they do not pay a fee at all. We do an overdraft and we simply do not charge a fee because it is in those parameters I was telling you about. I also am reminding people that if you do not overdraft they could pay an awful lot on the other side, including municipal bills, tax bills---- Senator Van Hollen. No, I---- Mr. Dimon. OK. It is not that simple. Senator Van Hollen. ----I am fully aware of that, Mr. Dimon. I did notice, and we can get into some differences later, that Citi--and it just happens to be the case in this instance--was able to provide that kind of flexibility, apparently, while eliminating revenue going forward from overdrafts. Look, I think everybody knows that we are talking about lower-income people, paycheck to paycheck. We are talking about billions of dollars in losses. I mean, this is an example of why it is expensive to be poor in the United States. Mr. Scharf, can you comment briefly on what you are thinking with respect to the future on overdraft payments? Mr. Scharf. Yes, Senator. So one of the things we should point out is we have made a series of changes, the last of which was just implemented recently. So we would also expect to see our overdraft fees decline. We have an account that has no overdraft fees in it, and so we give our customers the choice, and we are doing everything we can to make sure that those that do overdraft and pay the fees in these other accounts understand that there are other options for them. And we are going to continue to look at the fee structures that we have and ensure that we are competitive out in the marketplace. Senator Van Hollen. I appreciate it. Look, I think part of the answer here is the FedNow's real-time payment system, which I have been a strong proponent, pushing them to really accelerate the deployment. I have also introduced today, with colleagues from the House and the Senate, the Payment Modernization Act, which would essentially require institutions to make deposits available as soon as they are deposited. Because people living paycheck to paycheck, nobody should be making money off of them, in my view. They have the ongoing revenue. It is just that their check is deposited. One day they cannot access it? That makes no sense. As you know, many other countries have already gone to real-time payment systems, so we are going to be pushing that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen. Senator Tillis, of North Carolina, is recognized. Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all for being here. I want to echo what Senator Cramer said about the miraculous work you did for Paycheck Protection Program. I mean, back when I was advising banking clients, I am not sure I would have put my foot on the accelerator as much as you all did, given that you were trying to figure out the rules of the road, when the Treasury Secretary was giving you updates on facts. I mean, if people really understand the risks that you took ahead of the curve, everybody in Congress should be thankful that you did it, because I think it could save the economy. As a matter of fact, we had several bipartisan bills. We were reacting to something none of us had ever seen. We had not seen a pandemic in 100 years. And those bipartisan bills, I think, made the difference between what I think could have been a fiscal disaster and helped us weather the storm. But now I want to talk about what has happened over the last year-and-a-half. We went from a series of bipartisan bills, that we spent more than any one of us would have wanted to, into a series of partisan bills that I think are at least in part one of the reasons why we have the problems that we do today. Two-and-a-half trillion dollars on a purely partisan basis, flooding the zone with more liquidity than we probably needed. Under President Biden, we are authorizing 80,000 more IRS agents, we are going to retire student loan debt which is going to be more stimulus into the system, $201 billion in additional regulatory costs, 131 million hours of net new paperwork. The President has signed 77 Executive orders, the highest since President Ford, 40 times more than President Trump in the same time period, and three times more than President Obama. Last week, I had the occasion to go to Jacksonville, Florida. I always make time to drive 15 minutes away from it to visit the trailer park that I grew up in. At that time it was about a plot of land about 10 acres with six or seven trailers on it. Now it has got 100, and all but 6 are permanent residences. One of the reasons I do that--and I will be going to the trailer park I grew up in, in Nashville, next month--one of the reasons I go through there is just to have a chance conversation with somebody who is there like me, a 19-year-old kid. I moved from Waikiki Boulevard, which was called Hawaiian Village, where my parents lived, to Sugar Cane Lane, in the same trailer park, putting myself through community college. I like that chance opportunity to go to people and say, ``Where you are today, it is not where you can be.'' But I did not go to that trailer park on Friday, and I will not go to the one next month and have the same sort of optimism. In Chair Powell's speech from Jackson Hole, he has clearly indicated to me that we are into tough sledding next year. The rates are going to get up to 4 to 4.25 percent, and I do not see how it is possible--in his words he is talking about we are going to have to have a period of below trend growth. To a layperson, what I would tell that person in the trailer park is we are headed for a recession, and it is probably going to happen sometimes in the second half of next year. And I know also Chair Powell said, perception is reality, so let us not think that we are going into a recession because that could actually hasten it. I get that. But this is ``go'' time. Then is when people need to start planning. And I think it is almost unavoidable that those people that are growing up in the same circumstances that I have are going to suffer from the policies coming from this body, not what you all are doing. And we have to recognize that and we have to prepare people for that. I do have one question, and I may have a few other comments. I actually believe the stakeholder feedback and engagement has been foundational to what you banks have done since you were founded. You invest in the community. I just spoke to the President of the North Carolina bank for Bank of America. You have got a pilot in five cities now, trying to go into some of the most distressed neighborhoods and encourage business and growth. You take stakeholders' input into account. But I have just got one simple question, if you can raise your hands if you agree with this. At the end of the day, is it still shareholder promises that ultimately drives your decision process? At the end of the day, the people who have invested in your banks, the people who have risk in it? Just a show of hands. At the end of the day, when you have to make a decision, you take the input from stakeholders but then you make a decision. [Show of hands.] Senator Tillis. Thank you. Did I not see a show of hand over there? OK. Thank you. So I think we need to get away from the woke and everything else. The only other question I have for you. There are people talking about stakeholder capitalism is going to cause you all to make a strategic decision to unbank the energy industry, particularly fossil fuels. Are any of you planning to get out of that business? OK. So I, for one, think that we need fewer regulations in this space, and just to something that Senator Kennedy made, and I will finish here, he said that you all need to speak up. But how on earth can you speak up if you are fulfilling your fiduciary responsibility to shareholders, when you have got somebody out of control at the CFPB, the FDIC is a shambles, and the SEC. How can you possibly do that and fulfill your fiduciary responsibility to your shareholders because they will rain down hell on you? So I, for one, think that, Mr. Dimon, many others have alluded to it, if we want to avoid the bad story that I have got to tell those folks in the trailer park I will go visit next month in Nashville, we better get our act together, stop spending, stop taxing, right-size regulations, because we can do more to avoid a fiscal crisis next year, a recession next year, than anything you all could possibly do. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Chairman Brown. Thank you, Senator Tillis. Senator Smith, of Minnesota, is recognized. Senator Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chair and Ranking Member, and thank you to all of you for being with us today. Earlier this year, the Minneapolis Fed published a paper examining the role that race plays in mortgage denials. You may know that the Minneapolis metropolitan area has the largest Black-White home ownership gap in the entire country. And so while the Minneapolis Fed's findings were not surprising, the pervasiveness of this issue is really dramatic. In the Twin Cities, people of color are up to three times more likely to be denied a conventional 30-year mortgage than White applicants. And we understand there are lots of issues at play, of course, but this study specifically focused on low- risk borrowers. And even when controlling for difference in income and credit scores and even where a home is located, Black and Latino and Asian borrowers continued to be denied at high rates. I want to ask Mr. Scharf and Mr. Dimon first. Your two banks are the two largest mortgage loan originators last year. Could you tell us briefly what steps you are taking to address this issue and how policymakers can assist and support the efforts that need to be taken here? Mr. Scharf. Yes, Senator. Thank you for that. First of all, I think we are all deeply committed to increasing the amount of lending that we do to the minority community. I can speak to at our company we believe that our underwriting practices are applied equally, regardless of race, but there are a series of things that make it more complex and harder for certainly ethnic minorities to achieve an approval on a loan. We have been working with the Government agencies on special purpose lending facilities, to be able to target those most in need, and we have found the agencies to be very willing and able to do that. We know that things like FICO score are something which we all rely on and certainly is one of the things in the GSE underwriting criteria, and it does not appropriately account for things such as rent, some utilities, phone bills, and things like that. And certainly for those that are not homeowners, those payments are extremely important. So the more that we can do to work to bring those things into credit scoring I think would be extremely useful. Senator Smith. Mr. Dimon, would you like to add, please? Mr. Dimon. We also use these special credit facilities like looking at rent, utilities, et cetera. We have community branches. We opened a branch not far from where George Floyd was murdered. We are putting more loan offices in there. I agree there are problems with appraisals, there are problems with how you look at income, and we are trying to work on all of that. That is what we are doing. I also think the Government can do some things to reduce the cost of origination, servicing, securitization, and would make smaller mortgages--so think of a mortgage of $100,000 to $200,000--much more affordable, and that obviously would help lower-income individuals. So there is a lot that can be done to improve upon this. Senator Smith. Thank you. Mr. Cecere, U.S. Bank is headquartered in Minnesota. I believe your address is Nicollet Avenue, not Wall Street. And I know from our conversations that you and U.S. Bank have wrestled with this, particularly in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, which happened in both of our hometowns. It is impossible to look away from the systemic racism that we see in our community, and in all communities, I believe. So could you discuss how you and U.S. Bank is approaching this issue and addressing this disparity in our hometown? Mr. Cecere. Certainly. I think one of the things we all realize is how complicated and complex the mortgage process can be, and one of the areas we are focused on, like one of my colleagues said, is putting loan officers in those low- and moderate-income communities that look just like the person applying for the mortgage and helping them through that complex progress. That, coupled with some of the other thing we talked about with rent payments and utilities as being part of the underwriting process, I think all these things help the origination process be smoother, easier, and more successful for those individuals. Senator Smith. And are you at U.S. Bank looking at ways to sort of track your progress on this? Mr. Cecere. We are. In fact, after that study came out I personally met with the Fed leadership to talk about the data that they provided, some ideas we had, and we actually have a joint team working on it. Senator Smith. Thank you very much. I want to also just associated myself with the comments from Senator Warner and Senator Van Hollen about the power of CDFIs to help expand access to capital in communities, and I appreciate the comments of many of you on that topic. I will yield back, Mr. Chair. Senator Warnock [presiding]. Thank you so much, Senator Smith. Senator Hagerty. Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I would like to turn to a topic that disturbs me greatly. That is the trends in so-called ESG. I am going to ask a series of simple questions and would appreciate a yes or no answer from each of you. thanks. Mr. Rogers, by and large, when someone buys shares of your company they get to vote on company directors and management in proportion to their ownership share and their class of stock. Is that correct? Mr. Rogers. That is correct, Senator. Senator Hagerty. Thank you. Mr. Moynihan, when hard-working Americans plan ahead by investing in a retirement fund, for example, a BlackRock or a Vanguard fund that tracks the S&P 500, they are effectively buying a small share of each company in the index, including your companies. Is that correct? Mr. Moynihan. Yes, sir, that is correct. Senator Hagerty. Thank you. Mr. Cecere, when retirement investors buy shares in your companies through a fund managed by one of the major index fund providers most of these votes are not cast by the shareholders. Instead, companies like BlackRock or so-called proxy advisors, effectively make the voting determination for them. Correct? Mr. Cecere. That is correct. Senator Hagerty. And how does BlackRock or Vanguard decide how to vote the average American's shares? They have what is called an investment stewardship team that makes those decisions for them. This is at the heart of a troubling trend in the financial markets of weaponizing unsuspecting Americans' voting rights in the name of the radical environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, agenda. What these activists have figured out is that any radical policy that they cannot get enacted through Government can be advanced through corporate America by hijacking the trillions of dollars in voting rights from everyday Americans' retirement accounts. So a retired schoolteacher in Tennessee, like my mom, without her knowledge, is having the control that she paid for in her retirement accounts being wielded to push woke policies on corporations that she, and a vast majority of Americans, would find quite disturbing. Just last week I spoke with the CEO of a publicly traded company who was given marching orders by a young man from the Shareholder Stewardship Department of a large index fund provider. This young man was 2 years removed from college. In fact, the young man advised the CEO to divest his core business in the name of ESG. Why did this kid feel emboldened to do so? Well, because as an asset manager he controlled a significant portion of his company's shares, voting rights that were essentially robbed from American shareholders. And this year's proxy season was particularly egregious. Most of your banks had to fight off activist proposals including so-called racial equity audits and the forced de- banking of oil and gas companies. Mr. Dimon, I would like to turn to you. Do you believe that these activist shareholder stewards are accurately representing the views of the individual investors who actually own these shares? Mr. Dimon. Yeah, so all of those investors have a fiduciary responsibility to do their homework and vote. I personally think it is a disgrace when they rely on proxy advisors, and I think the proxy advisors are terrible. I am probably one of the few people who says that. I think it is a little bit worse than what you are saying because we have gone from 7,000 public companies to 4,000 operating companies over the last 20 years or so, and that is a problem. We are driving them private. This is part of the reason. And one thing I want to add, they are starting to do this passthrough proxy voting so that your mother can vote her shares. I am kind of in favor of that. But the way shares get voted today, if the person does not vote it counts as a yes vote on all those proxies you are talking about. You have got to change that. It has got to be a quorum of all those who vote. Senator Hagerty. Senator Sullivan is working on legislation to address this right now, and I support that legislation. Mr. Dimon, can I stay with you for just a moment longer. As an industry that is trying to refute claims from both sides of the aisle with being partisan, do you think that this trend in so-called shareholder activism actually complicates your ability to serve your clients or to yield value for your shareholders, more broadly? Mr. Dimon. Well, I am going to do the right thing, regardless of all that. But it is causing a lot of consternation in corporate America. Senator Hagerty. I would like to take a minute to go to a topic that Senator Toomey has already touched on, and that is bank capital. Capital requirements are designed to be countercyclical, meaning banks buildup capital during good economic times so that they can absorb losses and still deploy capital during economic downturns. That allows them to lend to consumers and small businesses when access to credit is most needed. Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr all but indicated during a recent speech at the Brookings Institution that he intends to increase capital requirements for a large number of U.S. financial institutions, even as our economy has suffered two consecutive quarters of negative growth. That is the technical definition of a recession. So as our economy is in the midst of a serious weakening, do any of you believe that increases in capital requirements now will not have a negative impact on economic growth or on your ability to lend to growing businesses? I did not think so. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Senator Warnock. Senator Cortez Masto. Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you to the panel members for being here. Let me talk about an issue that is important in my State to help lower costs, which is affordable housing. And I want to thank both Mr. Scharf and Ms. Fraser. We have had this conversation. I just recently toured Decatur Commons. It is a $110 million affordable housing rental development in Las Vegas. It is a beautiful, multi-family apartment development. It has 480 new units, 240 units for low-income families and 240 units for low-income seniors. Citi and Wells Fargo helped provide the financing to build this with Nevada HAND in Nevada. Mr. Scharf, in the past 2 years Wells Fargo provided $128 million to finance six affordable rental housing projects, providing nearly 1,000 new affordable units in Nevada. For those six developments, and in affordable housing just in general, your bank cannot just finance the entire cost of a large development. Is that not correct? In other words, you look to other complex financing that may come from low-income housing tax credits, the housing trust funds, vouchers, and other funds to make the deal pencil out. Is that right? Mr. Scharf. That is generally correct, yes. Senator Cortez Masto. And Ms. Fraser, in your testimony you shared that Citi has also provided $5.6 billion in 32 States to build affordable housing. Can you also share how Federal funds work with the housing developments Citi finances? Ms. Fraser. I think similar to how you described it. The low tax credits are an absolutely critical component to be able to bring together the different elements of a financing for the affordable housing projects, and we would certainly be encouraging the expansion of those credits so we can bring more and more capital into this critical need. Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you, because I do think it is important. I have listened to my colleagues. We all agree that we have got to lower costs around affordable housing. There is a role for Congress to play here. There is legislation that is out there that I support, and some of my colleagues do, that we should be passing to address this, to bring back the opportunity for families, first-time home buyers, for seniors, for low-income families, and so many, to be able to afford housing in this country. So I thank you for that. Let me give an opportunity to the other panelists. I am curious, with your banks, the work that you are doing around affordable housing as well. And I do not know, Mr. Moynihan, if you want to start. Mr. Moynihan. A couple of things, Senator. One, we compete for those projects and so we are all among the largest people who invest in low-income tax credit-driven transactions, and I think we have 2,700 properties around the country we invest in. One of the things I would raise with you to think about is in the Federal Advisory Committee you will see some reference, and we were asked by the Fed what could you do. So I think things like permitting, I think making sure that these tax credits are not lost if the OECD 15 percent tax rate is approved, because at the end of the day it drives the activity, and that is at risk if that gets approved, and that is up to you. I think the other thing is to continue to be inventive, a little bit like you did with the MDIs and CDFIs, with equity to developers to enhance the equity part, because we can only lend lenders something underneath us and you need both the expertise of development but also the equity. But it is a critical issue, and we all work on it every day. I mean, we have got literally $5 billion we did last year. We will do another $5 or $6 billion this year. It is not something we are not familiar with. And I would encourage you to sit with our experts, and they can give you 8,000 things that could make it easier. Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. Anyone else? Mr. Rogers. Thank you for your leadership on this, Senator. We have about $5 billion invested in affordable projects and about $1 billion last year, about 19,000 individual units. The only thing I could add to the discussion, I think opportunities to fast-track those projects in certain communities. As we talk to our builders they are often having times getting the approvals to get started. And I think if we could get affordable housing to the front of the line in communities it would be really helpful. Senator Cortez Masto. OK. Mr. Cecere. We have similar numbers, Senator, and I would also say, as you mentioned, the banks not only play a role in the low-income housing tax credit but it is collecting capital from all sources and making sure that the project is successful and is subjective. And I think that is a key component of our focus as well. Senator Cortez Masto. OK. Thank you. Mr. Demchak. We are obviously large in the business as well. I would just point out that this is one of the most successful private-public partnerships that I think we could point to in terms of having the intended outcome. And we should expand it and we should do more things like it. Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. Thank you to the panelists. I appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Warnock. Thank you so very much, Senator Cortez Masto. Senator Daines. Senator Daines. Senator Warnock, thank you. As we sit here today, inflation is up 8.3 percent from a year ago. It is barely below 40-year highs that we reached earlier this year. Food prices, shelter, new cars, medical services all increased by nearly a percentage point from last month. It is not surprising that we are seeing inflation. Those of us on this side of the aisle were warning the Administration back in March of 2021 about pushing forward here with these massive stimulus bills, when there was $1 trillion of unspent COVID funds sitting out there in December of 2020. Unfortunately, that was just the start of the spending for this Administration. In fact, an analysis from the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget estimates the Biden administration has approved $4.8 trillion in new borrowing through 2031, in the form of executive actions and enacted legislation. The student debt cancellation announced last month could cost as much as $1 trillion if you ask the folks over at Penn Wharton. It is amazing to me the Biden administration can say, with a straight face, that we are working to get inflation under control. While they have approved $4.8 trillion in additional borrowing, the so-called Inflation Reduction Act will reduce deficits by only $238 billion, leaving about $4.6 trillion in inflation creation. And, of course, this inflation comes at real consequences for Montanans and all American workers. We are seeing the decreases now in real wages of about 2.8 percent over the last year. I want to start, Mr. Dimon, President Biden recently said, during a ``60 Minutes'' interview, that inflation, quote, ``needs to be put in perspective'' and that the monthly inflation rate had, and I quote, ``hardly risen.'' My question is, do you agree with that assessment and with the President's implication that we are overreacting to the inflation that we are seeing in this economy? Mr. Dimon. I am not going to comment on what the President said, but it is high. It is likely to come down a little bit because some of those things could go away. But pieces are more embedded, like wages, housing, which are not going to go that quickly. And a lot of that stimulus is not spent yet. So rising rates may have to go higher than what people expect, and of course, if you have a global recession for whatever reason, it would help ameliorate that, but that is the bad reason. The most important thing is to avoid stagflation. Stagflation is the most damaging to every part of society, every industry, all income levels, and, therefore, I think it is important to get our hands around inflation as quickly as possible. Senator Daines. Mr. Scharf, what are your thoughts there on the inflation battle? Mr. Scharf. I would agree with Mr. Dimon. Senator Daines. All right. Thank you. I want to shift gears for a moment and talk about board composition. I am very concerned as we look across corporate America. You know, I spent a good part of my private sector career working for a Fortune 50 company, to ensure that we have boards that have, I will just call it balanced ideological tension, for lack of a better phrase. We have seen what has happened with journalism, has gone left. Entertainment has gone left. I do not want to see corporate America tip the teeter-totter, frankly, one way or the other, as they work every day to take care of their shareholders. Mr. Moynihan, I know as we think about diversity I know you believe that is important, of course. Mr. Moynihan. Yeah. Senator Daines. And the question is ideological diversity. I heard somebody describe diversity at Harvard is where everybody looks really different but thinks exactly the same. The question is, I have looked at the Bank of America's board. It contains twice as many Democrat donors as Republican donors. And I am not asking that you tip the teeter-totter to the right, but how do you maintain ideological diversity as it relates to board composition? Mr. Moynihan. Honestly, I do not know what our board does for political contributions. It is not part of what we look at. Our company gives to candidates on both sides of the aisle--not our company but our PAC does, which is independent of me. I do not make decisions. But I think if you look at our board members, the thing you will find with consistency is executives have been in very senior roles, like you, in big companies, because of the complexity. So former CEOs, former bankers. It is a great board and they do a great job. But that experience base of making decisions in a big, complex company, is what we look for. I have never asked a director how they vote, honestly. I have asked them about their experiences and what they could do to help our company be better. Senator Daines. Ms. Fraser, I question on energy. We are seeing, of course, energy prices going up dramatically. Europe is a case study of what not to do at the moment. It is going to be a really tough winter over in Europe because of very poor choices made, starting with the Germans and others, in terms of taking out baseload power. You stated back in April of 2020, that you would not finance Arctic drilling in Alaska. However, Citi has had no problems doing business with Russian oil companies, and was the last to announce a pullout from Russia. In fact, Citigroup did not even stop soliciting clients in Russia for 3 weeks after the February 24th invasion. My question is, why would you be using market share to put pressure on a shut-down American energy when the world's energy supply is in great need of more made-in-America energy? Of course, energy demand is going to increase 50 percent in the next 25 years, for the world, so we need more energy, not less, and coal, oil, and gas should be part of it. Senator Warnock. I just want to note that the gentleman is 50 seconds over already. Senator Daines. All right. I will let her respond. Ms. Fraser. Thank you for the question. Very briefly, I think there is a very important balance to be attained over the next few decades, the balance between energy security and energy supply, as well as a transition to cleaner energy sources, and that is going to be an important balance. We will play an important role in both. Senator Daines. Yeah. The Europeans lost sight of balance, let the record state. Thank you. Senator Warnock. Thank you, Mr. Daines. I will now acknowledge myself for questions. When it comes to the costs for families, the country's biggest banks often set the pace for the rest of the country. This is why it is so important for us to hold the biggest banks accountable for the services they provide. Smaller banks imitate policies that you set for your banks throughout the Nation. This is especially true for the fees you charge your customers. And in a recent report, the CFPB detailed the crippling effects of overdraft fees and the impact that this is continuing to have on families. These penalties fall on a small number of folks who carry most of the fees, with banks charging 80 percent of fees to only 9 percent of account holders--80 percent of fees to 9 percent of account holders. Typically these lower-income folks are already struggling financially. These fees make conditions worse and can keep them trapped in a cycle of debt. I do want to recognize that some of the banks present, such Citi and Bank of America, have eliminated or taken strides to reduce their fees. Mr. Rogers, earlier this year Truist announced a new account type with no overdraft fees. How do these accounts affect customers' overall financial health? What are you seeing, especially for those who frequently overdraft and lower-income folks? Mr. Rogers. Thanks, Senator. Specifically as to Truist One, this is an account with no overdraft fees. But the other feature that I think is almost more important is it has a negative $100 buffer. So in addition to not charging a fee, we did a lot of study and a lot of work about how much clients typically overdraw in terms of an amount. So this $100 negative buffer is afforded to every client and allows them to continue to transact. So not only not have fees but able to pay the daycare bill, pay the rental bill. And the activity we have seen in that is really important. And then also we have another account called the Truist Confidence Account. And I think in that case we have seen, and we have tried to do some studies around this to learn more, we have actually seen new entrants into the banking system. So someone who was previously unbanked who may have not come to Truist for some of our other account capabilities came into our system with these types of accounts. So I think in addition to providing the buffers, I think we are affording more entrants into the banking system, which I believe has got to be a goal for us. Senator Warnock. Well thank you. And some of the banks that are testifying today still have restrictive policies in place that make it difficult for hard-working families to meet their basic needs. So I would like to ask each of you, will you commit today to work to eliminate onerous fees? A simple yes or no would suffice, and you can elaborate in writing after the hearing. I will begin with Mr. Scharf. Will you work to eliminate onerous fees? Mr. Scharf. Senator, we have an account that does---- Senator Warnock. A simple yes or no. Mr. Scharf. ----well, we have an account that does not have fees, so the customer has the option, and we are going to continue to look at our fee structures. Senator Warnock. Mr. Dimon? Mr. Dimon. I would say the same thing, that we have already made a lot of changes since that report, which I would love to share with you, and we have the same type of ways to make it easier for people. I do think giving people a choice and letting them opt in or out is the proper thing to do, and it actually saves them from far worse pain and suffering. They do not bounce a check or something. And a lot of people, they get charged much more on the other side. So when we looked at this we said it is more respectful. I agree with the fact it gets misused sometimes, and we have got to do a better job of counseling, closing, et cetera, for those where it is just too much. Senator Warnock. So you are committed to doing a better job? Mr. Dimon. Yes. Senator Warnock. Mr. Cecere? Mr. Cecere. Senator, we also have an account that provides no overdraft fees. I think an important component of this, as well, though, is education and alerts to the customers when they are entering a situation that they may overdraft, and help them in advance with other alternatives, and that is something we are also focused on. Senator Warnock. Mr. Demchak? Mr. Demchak. Senator, we led the charge to drop overdraft fees. We have two accounts with no fees. We have a unique product that actually allows the client to choose in the moment if they want to return the item or pay the item. And we will continue to look on how to improve that. Senator Warnock. I have seen, personally, as a Senator, as a pastor, the impact that these fees have on ordinary folks who are just struggling, trying to make ends meet. So this is an important issue, one that I will stay on. Now I am concerned with part of what is happening in this moment. According to the FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile, the banking sector's profits declined 8.5 percent year over year in the second quarter of 2022. And here is my concern, is that as you are dealing with that large economic reality I imagine that you have discussed ways to find new revenue streams or to cut costs. Mr. Moynihan, has Bank of America discussed opening up other revenue streams or reintroducing financial products to offset these losses? Mr. Moynihan. No, sir. Senator Warnock. Have you considered looking back at the changes your bank has made to reduce fees over the past year? Mr. Moynihan. No, sir. Senator Warnock. Ms. Fraser, same question. Ms. Fraser. We are perpetually looking at what we can do to make our fees more customer friendly and what we can do to make sure we provide access to those who do not have ready access to banking services. So it is a perpetual move that we make. Senator Warnock. So you are committed to not balancing your budget on the banks of the most marginalized customers. Ms. Fraser. Yes. We absolutely are committed to that. Senator Warnock. Thank you so very much, Mr. Chair. The distinguished Senator from Georgia. Senator Ossoff. I remember when you were all the way down here with me. I do not know what happened. [Laughter.] Senator Ossoff. OK. Thank you all for being here. I am going to try to get through a lot as efficiently as possible. I want to begin, Mr. Scharf, by talking about housing supply and affordable housing. I recently wrote to you and several other mortgage lenders about accessory dwelling units, so basement or backyard apartments, in-lawsuites. There are some regulatory changes that the FHFA related to agencies that may allow more lending to capitalize the construction of accessory dwelling units. I would just like your commitment that you are going to respond to my letter thoughtfully and consider how you can capitalize more of that construction to bring more housing supply online and help more families afford housing. Mr. Scharf. Absolutely, Senator. We will. Senator Ossoff. Thank you, Mr. Scharf. Ms. Fraser, I would like to ask you about language access to banking services for prospective homeowners, for entrepreneurs. Accessing credit, accessing depository services in languages other than English is important for many of my constituents. I noted that Citigroup now offers the Citi Mobile app entirely in Spanish. That is a step that I applaud. Just in brief, can you talk about other opportunities to expand access to banking services for Spanish speakers, Korean speakers, other non-English language speakers? Ms. Fraser. Well first of all I agree with you. The importance of making this very accessible, having it in a language one understands is an important element of providing access to banking services. The other efforts are also on the digital technologies that have evolved. Making sure that those are readily available for those populations that have not been used to working with a bank and may be intimidated walking into a bank branch or asking for assistance is also an important step forward. So I think both the app and also working with our different partners in various communities, making sure that we are providing webinars or other areas. So it is a friendliness toward the bank to build trust and understanding and comfort, with using the many services we have available. Senator Ossoff. Thank you, Ms. Fraser, and let us remain in touch about how the industry can better serve linguistically diverse communities. Mr. Moynihan, I would like to ask you a question about the vulnerability of various communities to fraud. There has been some discussion of Zelle here. I am particularly worried about scams and fraud that we have seen in Georgia, targeting veterans, targeting new mothers. I would like for you to just commit to following up with my office, your staff can follow up with my office, about the steps that you are taking and that you recommend based upon what you have seen is effective to protect veterans and new mothers and families in Georgia and across the country from fraud. Will you do that, please? Mr. Moynihan. Sure, Senator. I think you may have missed it earlier but we had a fairly robust discussion about all the commitments, with all of my colleagues and ourselves, to continue to work on the fraud side of this. Senator Ossoff. I did not miss it. I followed it closely. But I would just like to hear from your team on how we can work together to continue to crack down on fraud. Thank you so much. Mr. Scharf, a question for you about rural bank closures. Many rural counties in Georgia--Hancock County, Wheeler County, Dooly County--have lost branches. What steps can banks take-- and I have just got a-minute-and-a-half left, so more ground to cover--but in a nutshell, to sustain the availability of credit and banking services in rural communities? Mr. Scharf. First of all I think banks should be very, very sensitive, and I think we are, about not leaving the community unbanked. And so if we are looking at closing facilities we should think twice about it if there is no other banking service there. And that could mean us staying or working with a community bank or selling those deposits and customers to someone else there. That, in addition to some innovative solutions that we are all working through, such as mobile banking--I mean, physical mobile banking, which comes to different communities at different points in the week--is also an interesting solution. Senator Ossoff. Mr. Scharf, a follow-up for you. Obviously, as lenders you have obligations, fiduciary obligations, shareholder obligations, regulatory obligations, to assess the credit-worthiness of borrowers, and that is part of your job. How can credit-worthiness be accurately assessed without using methodologies with unintended consequences that might, for example, discriminate on race or other lines? Mr. Scharf. Well, I think, you know, one of the things that we talked about earlier is the need to continue to try and refine FICO scores, which I think we are all doing work on. A lot of it is being led by the OCC, but we all have our individual efforts as well, to look at things like rent payments, utilities, phone bills, and things like that, because those very often are the consistent payments that more diverse people wind up building their credit upon and are not always reflected in a FICO score. Senator Ossoff. Thank you. With the Chairman's indulgence, one final question. Chairman Brown [presiding]. Sure. Senator Ossoff. It is a compound question. You will forgive me, I hope. Mr. Dimon, this is a good one to close on. Dodd-Frank, what is working? What is not? And is financial regulation fragmented across too many agencies with overlapping jurisdiction? Let us see. Maybe the Chairman will give you a minute to answer that one. Chairman Brown. Mr. Dimon, try to answer it in 60 seconds. Mr. Dimon. What worked is to resolution recovery capital liquidity. That was all good. There are a lot of things in there that had nothing to do with all that. Lehman Brothers simply would not happen today. Too much capital, too much vulnerable debt, too much liquidity, et cetera. Regulation needs to be calibrated, so the things that do not work--as I mentioned yesterday, we are going to have a trillion dollars of cash at one point, unable to deploy it to help clients because you are going to run into these red lines of various capital. My request is people should just thoughtfully look at the effect of these things, and the regulatory system also made it very hard for regulators. So we talk about housing here. There are seven people with independent authority on mortgages, so it is almost impossible to change them in a way that would benefit America. And I wish one day we would fix that problem. We have Balkan-ized the system. Chairman Brown. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Dimon. Thank you, Senator Ossoff. That concludes the hearing. Anyone listening today heard a lot from you about the strength of your industry, how well- capitalized your banks are, how well you weathered the pandemic, how well your depositors did, how generously your banks have changed your overdraft fee schedule. But let us be clear. You are well-capitalized and you thrived throughout the pandemic because of the capital requirements and safety and soundness measures that we passed in Dodd-Frank, which you lobbied against, I would add. Your depositors had more money in their accounts because we put money in their pockets with the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan and the child tax credit. You reformed your overdraft practices after years of pressure from this Committee. Most of what you boasted about today came about either because of laws this Committee and the Senate passed or because of pressure we placed on your industry, often despite some of your very expensive and very often effective lobbying efforts. Like most big corporations, big banks have repeatedly shown you will not do the right thing without strong laws, without accountability, without public pressure, without oversight. That is the job of this Committee. I say that, and I also say that as Chair I look for places of agreement, places we can work together. Today, not surprisingly, we found some. I listened to you about regulating what we should do about regulating fintech. I particularly appreciate the chair of PNC, and even when he did this, especially, [indicating] and how that, I think, really reached people on this Committee that were listening or watching, that we need to make sure that the growing part of the economy, the fintechs, what we need to do with ILCs, how we cannot count on them to do the right thing out of the goodness of their hearts, and they need strong rules too. Thank you again to the witnesses. For Senators who wish to submit questions, those questions are due 1 week from today, Thursday, September 29th. To all of the seven of you, again thanks for your cooperation. You have 45 days to respond to any of those questions. Thank you again. Senator Toomey, thank you. The Committee is adjourned. [Whereupon, at 12:20 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.] [Prepared statements, responses to written questions, and additional material supplied for the record follow:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN SHERROD BROWN For too long, everyone called this Committee Senate Banking-- because it always delivered for Wall Street. We changed that, at the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. We put the Main Street economy--and the workers who power it--at the center of everything we do. Part of that commitment is to hear directly from the biggest banks that hold so much power in the economy. It's our job to hold them accountable to their workers, to their customers, and to the American people. Today, we will continue a tradition we started last year, and hear from the CEOs of the Nation's seven biggest retail banks. After years of consolidation and concentration--through banking crises and rubber-stamped mergers--your banks dominate the banking industry. Together, you have over $13 trillion in assets--that's half the Nation's GDP. You have hundreds of millions of customers. You also have the benefit of a Federal backstop--a safety net--something that your customers don't have. Your decisions affect millions of peoples' lives--whether they can get their paycheck, how much it will cost to use their hard-earned money, whether they can save for retirement or their kids' education, whether they can buy a house or make rent. And you profit from all those transactions--to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. With those profits--and with the taxpayer support you get--come a responsibility to actually serve your customers and the larger economy. And I think you know you don't always hold up your end of the bargain: All of your banks have promoted Zelle, the payment app that most of you own. You pushed this on customers--but you haven't taken responsibility for the fraud that it's perpetuated. We all know about Wells Fargo's fake account scandal. And we've learned that Wells wasn't alone. In the never-ending quest for short- term profits, it turns out that other banks pressured their employees to open fake checking and credit card accounts. Customers who trust you to look out for them ended up with unjustified fees, damaged credit reports, and accounts they did not want.or even know about. It's even worse for Black and Brown consumers. Too often they walk into many of your banks not knowing if their check will be cashed or if they'll be able to open an account. When mortgage rates were at record lows, many of you were more likely to deny mortgages for Black and Latino borrowers, making it even harder for these families to build wealth through home ownership. You focus on loans to wealthy clients who have massive stock portfolios. And at least one of you has complained about the paperwork on mortgages or small business loans for Main Street. And when consumers try to hold you accountable for cheating them out of their money, you subject them to forced arbitration. You take away people's choice on how to pursue justice--because as we all know, if there's one thing Wall Street hates, it's real consequences. And it isn't just the outright scams and fraud that damage our economy. It's your entire business model, with short-term, quarterly profits as the Holy Grail. I have talked with workers in Ohio and across the country--in places that so often get passed over for investment. They tell me about the challenges they have with the banking system. They've watched your banks let them down, time and time again. It's why so many people don't trust the financial system. They've been burned over and over by second-chance accounts, foreclosures, late fees, overdraft fees. They've been turned down for loans. They've seen branches close. They've been scammed out of their money. Yesterday, I spoke to an Ohioan whose accounts were illegally frozen by one of your banks. She had zero access to her funds for a whole week, and the bank intended to take $442 out of her account, leaving her with nothing. So it's not surprising that more and more Americans turn to shady payday lenders or risky crypto apps. They feel like they don't have any other choice, when they have bills piling up and need to come up with the money. Over a third of Americans report they wouldn't be able to cover a $400 expense in an emergency--if their car breaks down, if they lose their job, if their child needs surgery. All of you make tens of millions of dollars a year--150 to 900 times what your median employee makes. You probably don't think twice about $400. That's not a luxury that most Americans have. They don't get the same breaks you do. During the pandemic, the Federal Reserve waived overdraft fees for banks--yet none of you waived those fees for your customers in 2020. And it's not just your customers who have to make tough choices because of decisions that you make. It's also your workers. You spend your billions in profits on exorbitant executive pay and stock buybacks--instead of investing in your workers, your customers, your communities. You say that you provide your workers with good pay and benefits, but how does it feel as a worker to be pressured to open fake accounts, to deny services to someone who walks in the door who doesn't look like you--hardly a culture promoting the dignity of work. Don't take it from me. Listen to what bank workers have said: From one Wells Fargo worker: ``We want the customer base to know we're forming a union really for them. We're tired of having our name dragged through the mud at Wells Fargo because of things that we've asked to have more control over, but the company refuses to give us that control.'' Another worker said, ``They keep telling us we no longer have sales goals but we are given expectations as far as loan volume, new accounts, day-one mobile activations. Not meeting these expectations will result in disciplinary action.'' They added, ``But the loyalty and responsibility I feel for my customers keeps me fighting every day.'' Just trust us, you say. We're making changes, we don't need Government watchdogs, we don't need regulations. But trust goes both ways. And with crisis after crisis, and scandal after scandal, the biggest Wall Street banks have lost the trust of the American people. And as super regional banks get bigger and more complex, they're starting to look more and more like Wall Street. I expect all of your banks to build up capital, and use it to invest in communities--not just your shareholders, not just your own compensation. I expect you to treat all your customers fairly. And I expect you to take steps to make banking work better for your customers and your workers. Steps like: eliminating overdraft and excessive fees, lowering the costs of basic bank accounts, ending forced arbitration, offering affordable home loans to all eligible borrowers in all communities. It means paying your workers--including contractors who feed you, who clean your office, who keep your banks and offices safe--a living wage. Some of your banks have taken positive steps to eliminate some fees and give consumers more power and choice over their own money. Some of your banks have made commitments to increase your workers' wages. That's a good start. These positive steps need to be part of a real commitment to changing how Wall Street does business--not just one-offs. You are among the most powerful actors in our economy. Your entire industry, and its substantial safety net are supported by American taxpayers. It's past time for the financial industry to be as good to the American people as the country has been to you. We will continue to hold you to the highest standards, so that Americans can keep more of their hard-earned money. ______ PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR PATRICK J. TOOMEY Today's hearing presents an opportunity to discuss the role of the Nation's largest banks. At the outset, let me acknowledge what should be obvious: banks are essential for supporting the economy and advancing American competiveness. Their core functions--taking deposits, making loans, and processing payments, and, in several cases, underwriting and making markets in securities--help to safeguard savings and provide credit, which enables economic growth. With nearly $13 trillion in combined assets and operations ranging from mortgage banking to small business lending, the banks here today make vital contributions to the Nation's prosperity. But where I see a system at the heart of free enterprise, I worry other policymakers see opportunity for social engineering. Activist regulators and some of my colleagues see banks as a tool by which they can advance their social policy. Unfortunately, there's a growing trend of banks--several of them are represented here today--inserting themselves into highly charged social and political issues unrelated to their businesses. Banks' willingness to help liberal policymakers achieve their liberal goals makes it very difficult to mount a principled defense against such politicization. Some of my colleagues are pressuring banks to use both their balance sheets and their influence to address issues wholly unrelated to banking, such as global warming, gun control, voter rights, and abortion. Several large banks have been far too willing to acquiesce to these demands by embracing a liberal ESG agenda that harms America. Nearly every bank at this hearing has pledged to meet a ``net zero'' greenhouse gas emission goal by 2050, with several making even more specific commitments. Carrying through on such pledges will eventually lead these banks to artificially restrict, reduce, or cut- off funding for traditional energy projects. Despite statements to the contrary, none of this has much to do with borrowers' credit quality or so-called transition risk. It's because activists have made the traditional energy sector politically disfavored. We're witnessing the folly of such policy right now in Europe, which strangled its own fossil energy sector and now finds itself deeply reliant on Russian gas. Does anyone really believe that as the U.S. experiences 40-year high inflation we should exacerbate the problem by reducing oil and natural gas production and increasing energy prices? But that's exactly what will happen if banks follow through with their ``net zero'' pledges and ESG agenda, as environmental activist groups have urged. When combined with the SEC's proposed climate disclosure rule, these ``net zero'' pledges are setting up banks for lawsuits and legal liability. Apparently some banks are starting to acknowledge this reality. A report in the Financial Times this week says some banks are considering leaving the so-called ``Net-Zero Banking Alliance''--a UN- sponsored group that intends to name and shame banks that don't meet net zero pledges. It was a mistake to join this group in the first place, but, for the sake of shareholders and the U.S. economy, banks distancing themselves now would be a welcome step. In addition, banks have inserted themselves into contentious social issues, and, in some cases, even made business decisions based on these factors. For example, several banks responded to pressure from Democrats in the wake of the Supreme Court's Dobbs' decision by very publicly pledging to pay for the costs of their employees to travel to have abortions. This decision is an individual bank's choice, but it raises a number of questions, such as: Have these same banks also committed to pay the costs for their female employees facing unplanned pregnancies to place their children for adoption? Notably, when it comes to the right to keep and bear arms--which is an actual constitutional right--some banks have gone out of their way to make it harder for law-abiding Americans to exercise this right, from stopping the financing of manufacturers of so-called military- style firearms for civilian use, to de-banking retailers that sell firearms to customers under 21 years of age, even when such sales are lawful. I can't help but observe that when banks do weigh-in on highly charged social and political issues, they seem to always come down on the liberal side. Beyond the examples I've already given, there are others. Banks have opined on abortion, but not religious liberty. Banks have expressed support for voting access, but are silent on voting security. Banks have expressed support for DACA, but I've heard nothing about border security. My view is it's bad business to alienate roughly half the country, but you are private companies and are free to opine as you see fit. However, it's no wonder there's been a strong backlash from policymakers in States like Texas, West Virginia, and Florida. If banks don't cease and desist from weighing in on social and cultural issues, don't be shocked if Republicans, once back in power nationally, seek to pressure banks to advance their goals. Could banks be forced to explicitly de-bank corporate customers that engage in woke policy debates, like Disney did in Florida? Or will banks be incentivized to subsidize oil and gas financing? Or explicitly reject ESG? I would oppose such efforts, just as I oppose similar efforts by liberals. But once the precedent is set, the potential for future abuse is limitless. Throughout this Congress, I've repeatedly warned about the politicization of our financial regulators and our central bank. I've emphasized that addressing political issues requires difficult decisions involving tradeoffs. In a democratic society, those tradeoffs must be made by elected representatives, who are accountable to the American people. Today, I'm raising similar concerns about the politicization of our Nation's banks. Just as regulators and central bankers are not elected by the American people, neither are bank CEOs. Banks are currently at a critical crossroads: Accept the role that some liberals prefer which is to have your institutions implement social policy on behalf of the State, or embrace your history as drivers and promoters of free enterprise and stay out of highly charged social and political issues. I strongly suggest you choose the latter path. If you don't, you risk being treated as public utilities--by both parties--in the future. PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHARLES W.

The following provide answers to frequently asked questions about the employer shared responsibility provisions. More detailed information is available on the Employer Shared Responsibility page and in final regulations under section 4980H.\n- Basics of the Employer Shared Responsibility Provisions: Questions 1-4\n- Employers Subject to the Employer Shared Responsibility Provisions: Questions 5-18\n- Identification of Full-Time Employees: Questions 19-28\n- Offers of Coverage: Questions 29-38\n- Affordability and Minimum Value: Questions 39-42\n- Liability for the Employer Shared Responsibility Payment: Questions 43-52\n- Calculation of the Employer Shared Responsibility Payment: Questions 53-55\n- Making an Employer Shared Responsibility Payment: Questions 56-59\n- Limited Transition Relief in 2016: Questions 60-64\n- Related Provisions: Questions 65-67\nBasics of the employer shared responsibility provisions\nThe employer shared responsibility provisions were added under section 4980H of the Internal Revenue Code by the Affordable Care Act. Under these provisions, certain employers (called applicable large employers or ALEs) must either offer health coverage that is “affordable” and that provides “minimum value” to their full-time employees (and offer coverage to the full-time employees’ dependents), or potentially make an employer shared responsibility payment to the IRS, if at least one of their full-time employees receives a premium tax credit for purchasing individual coverage on a Health Insurance Marketplace (Marketplace), also called the Exchange.\nWhether an employer is an ALE and is therefore subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions depends on the size of its workforce. In general, employers employing at least a certain threshold number of employees (generally 50 full-time employees including full-time equivalent employees, which means a combination of part-time employees that count as one or more full-time employees) are ALEs. The vast majority of employers fall below the ALE size threshold and therefore are not subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions.\nThe employer shared responsibility provisions generally were first effective in 2015 but several forms of transition relief were available for 2015. Several forms of transition relief also were available to some employers for 2016. No transition relief is available for 2017 and future years. For more information see Limited Transition Relief in 2016.\nYes. Employers that are subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions (that is, ALEs) are required to report information about whether they offered coverage to employees and if so, information about the offer of coverage. ALEs are required to send this information to the IRS on Form 1094-C, Transmittal of Employer-Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage Information Returns, and Form 1095-C, Employer-Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage. ALEs are also required to send the Form 1095-C for each employee to that employee. The information on these forms is used to determine whether an ALE owes a payment under the employer shared responsibility provisions and whether employees are eligible for the premium tax credit. For additional information, see the section 6056 final regulations, the Instructions for Forms 1094-C and 1095-C, the Questions and Answers about Information Reporting by Employers on Form 1094-C and Form 1095-C, and the IRS Q&A page for offers of health insurance coverage by employers (Section 6056).\nAlso, an employer that sponsors self-insured health coverage – whether or not the employer is an ALE – has information reporting responsibilities as a provider of minimum essential coverage. In general, an ALE that sponsors self-insured health coverage will use the same form it uses to report about offers of coverage (Form 1095-C) to satisfy this requirement by filling out an additional section (Part III) for employees and family members who enroll in the coverage. See the Instructions for Forms 1094-C and 1095-C. For additional information, including for employers that are not ALEs but that sponsor self-insured health coverage, see the section 6055 final regulations, the Instructions for Forms 1094-B and 1095-B, and the IRS Q&A page for information reporting by coverage providers (Section 6055).\nYes. The latest news and a list of resources are available at the Applicable Large Employer Information Center and the ACA Legal Guidance and Other Resources page. The information available includes links to recorded webinars that anyone can review at any time to better understand the employer shared responsibility provisions and the related information reporting requirements.\nThe Applicable Large Employer Information Center includes links to a wide variety of resources regarding the employer shared responsibility provision, such as links to current webinars, tax provisions, questions and answers, forms and instructions, and other publications.\nThe ACA Legal Guidance and Other Resources page includes links to YouTube videos, podcasts and other IRS outreach materials regarding the employer shared responsibility provisions and other ACA topics.\nEmployers subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions\nWhether an employer is an ALE in a particular calendar year generally depends on the size of the employer’s workforce in the preceding calendar year. For example, an employer will use information about the size of its workforce during 2016 to determine if it is an ALE for 2017.\nTo be an ALE for a calendar year, an employer must have employed an average of at least 50 full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) during the preceding calendar year. To determine its workforce size for a calendar year, an employer adds its total number of full-time employees for each month of the prior calendar year to the total number of full-time equivalent employees for each month of the prior calendar year and divides by 12.\nIn general, for this purpose, an employer determines its number of full-time employees for a month by counting individuals employed on average for at least 30 hours of service per week during the month or at least 130 hours of service during the month. An employer determines its number of full-time equivalent employees for a month by combining the number of hours of service of all non-full-time employees for the month (but not including more than 120 hours of service per employee), and dividing the total by 120. For example, an employer that employs 40 full-time employees and 20 employees each with 60 hours of service in a month has the equivalent of 50 full-time employees in the month (40 full-time employees plus 10 full-time equivalent employees (20 X 60 = 1200, and 1200/120 =10)).\nFor section 4980H purposes, the number of an employer’s full-time equivalent employees is relevant only to determine if the employer is an ALE; full-time equivalent employees are not taken into account in determining the amount of employer shared responsibility payment, if any, that an ALE may owe.\nGenerally, all employees are counted (either as full-time employees or full-time equivalent employees) when an employer is determining whether it is an ALE, but there are some exceptions.\n- Seasonal workers: An employer is not an ALE if both of the following apply: (1) the employer’s workforce exceeds 50 full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) for 120 days or fewer during the preceding calendar year, and (2) all of the employees in excess of 50 employed during that period of no more than 120 days are seasonal workers. Seasonal workers are workers who perform labor or services on a seasonal basis as defined by the Department of Labor, and retail workers employed exclusively during holiday seasons. For this purpose, employers may apply a reasonable, good faith interpretation of the term “seasonal worker” and a reasonable, good faith interpretation of the Department of Labor’s definition of seasonal worker.\n- TRICARE/Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Coverage: Employees who have coverage under TRICARE or a VA health program are not taken into account in determining if an employer is an ALE.\nThese exceptions apply solely for purposes of determining whether an employer is an ALE. For additional information, see section 4980H(c)(2)(F) and section 54.4980H-2(b) of the regulations.\nAn employer that was not in existence on any business day in the prior calendar year is considered to be an ALE in the current calendar year if the employer is reasonably expected to employ, and actually does employ, an average of at least 50 full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) on business days during the current calendar year. For this purpose, an employer does not take into account employees who have coverage under TRICARE or a VA health program (as described in section 4980H(c)(2)(F)). See section 54.4980H-2(b) of the regulations for how the seasonal worker exception applies in this case.\nIn contrast, for the next calendar year (the year after the first year the employer was in existence), the employer determines its status as an ALE under the general rules.\nAn employer determines if it is an ALE for a current calendar year based on its number of full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) during the prior calendar year. If an employer hires additional employees, including some part-time employees, during the current calendar year, the employer will take those employees into account when determining if it is an ALE for the next calendar year.\nAll employers that are ALEs are subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions, including for-profit, nonprofit (whether or not a tax-exempt organization), and government entity employers.\nYes. There is no exclusion from the employer shared responsibility provisions for government entities. All employers that are ALEs are subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions, including federal, state, local, and Indian tribal government employers.\nYes. The employer shared responsibility provisions include a rule that also applies for certain other tax and employee benefit purposes (section 414). Under this rule, two or more businesses that have a certain level of common or related ownership generally are treated as a single employer, and are combined for purposes of determining whether or not they collectively employ at least 50 full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees). If the combined total meets the ALE threshold, then each separate business is considered to be part of an ALE and is therefore subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions. This includes any business that does not employ enough employees to meet the ALE threshold on its own. Under this rule, an ALE may be a single employer or a group of related employers treated as an aggregated ALE group, which is a group of employers treated as a single employer under section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o). Each employer that is a member of an aggregated ALE group is referred to as an ALE member.\nFor example, if an individual owns 80 percent or more of two businesses that are separate legal entities, the total number of full-time employees of that employer is based on the full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) in both businesses combined together. If the employees in the combined businesses add up to fewer than 50 full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) in a calendar year, the employer shared responsibility provisions will not apply to those businesses for the following calendar year.\nCommon or related ownership affects only whether an employer is an ALE member and therefore subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions. Employers with a certain level of common or related ownership are treated as a single employer for determining whether an employer is an ALE. The rules for combining employers do not apply for purposes of determining whether any particular ALE member owes an employer shared responsibility payment or the amount of any payment. That is determined separately for each related ALE member.\nYes. But a special standard applies to government entity employers in applying the rules for combining employers under section 414 for purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions. Because specific rules under section 414 have not yet been developed for government entities and because section 414 relates to a certain level of common or related ownership and government entities are not typically “owned” by other entities, government entities may apply a good faith reasonable interpretation of section 414 to determine whether they should be combined with other entities.\nUnder the section 414 rules for combining employers that apply for purposes of determining which employers are ALEs under the employer shared responsibility provisions, the employees of employers that have a certain level of common or related ownership are added together to determine if an employer employs at least 50 full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees). The rules under section 414 for combining employers have applied for purposes of applying the federal tax rules for 401(k) and other retirement plans to employers with certain common or related ownership for years.\nYes. For purposes of determining if an employer is an ALE, all employees are counted (subject to limited exceptions for certain seasonal workers and employees who have coverage under TRICARE or a VA health program), regardless of whether the employees are eligible for coverage from other sources.\nYes. For purposes of determining if an employer is an ALE, all employees are counted (subject to limited exceptions for certain seasonal workers and employees who have coverage under TRICARE or a VA health program), regardless of whether the employees are exempt from the individual shared responsibility provision.\nGenerally, the employer shared responsibility provisions apply to an employer with employees (U.S. citizens or non-citizens) working abroad only if the employer has at least 50 full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees), determined by taking into account only work performed in the United States. For this purpose, the hours of service that an employee works does not include an hour of service to the extent the compensation for services performed constitutes income from sources outside the United States. (The term United States refers only to the 50 States and the District of Columbia and does not include the U.S. territories.) Thus, employees (U.S. citizens or non-citizens) working only abroad generally are not taken into account for purposes of determining whether an employer is an ALE or for purposes of determining whether the employer owes an employer shared responsibility payment or the amount of any such payment.\nNo. Whether an employer member of an association that offers coverage through an AHP is an ALE that is subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions depends on the number of full-time employees (and full-time equivalent employees) the member employer employed in the prior calendar year and is unrelated to whether the employer offers coverage through an AHP. An employer that is not an ALE under the employer shared responsibility provisions does not become an ALE due to participation in an AHP, and an employer that is an ALE under the employer shared responsibility provisions continues to be an ALE subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions regardless of its participation in an AHP. (The only circumstances in which multiple employers are treated as a single employer for purposes of determining whether the employer is an ALE is if the employers have a certain level of common or related ownership. For more information see the questions about common or related ownership in this section.)\nFor more information on AHPs, see regulations PDF issued on June 21, 2018 by the Department of Labor.\nIdentification of full-time employees\nFor purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions, an employee is an individual who is an employee under the common-law standard for determining employer-employee relationships. An employee does not include a sole proprietor, a partner in a partnership, an S corporation shareholder who owns at least 2 percent of the S corporation, a leased employee within the meaning of section 414(n), or a worker that is a qualified real estate agent or direct seller. See Pub.15-A, Employer’s Supplemental Tax Guide, for more information on determining who is an employee.\nAn employee is considered full-time if he or she has sufficient hours of service. In particular, for purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions, an employee is a full-time employee for a calendar month if he or she averages at least 30 hours of service per week or has 130 hours of service in the month (130 hours of service in a month is treated as the monthly equivalent of at least 30 hours of service per week).\nThere are two methods for determining whether an employee is a full-time employee:\n- Monthly measurement method: Under the monthly measurement method, an employer determines whether an employee is a full-time employee by counting the employee’s hours of service for each month.\n- Look-back measurement method: Under the look-back measurement method, an employer determines whether an employee is a full-time employee for a future period (referred to as the stability period), based upon the employee’s hours of service in a prior period (referred to as the measurement period). The look-back measurement method for identifying full-time employees is available only for purposes of determining and computing liability for an employer shared responsibility payment, and not for purposes of determining if the employer is an ALE. The look-back measurement method provides special rules that apply in various circumstances, such as for variable-hour employees, seasonal employees, and employees of educational organizations.\nFor rules on when an employer may use different methods of determining full-time employee status for different categories of employees, see section 54.4980H-3(e) of the regulations.\nThese methods are used to determine full-time employee status for purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions; these rules do not affect whether an employer may offer coverage to part-time employees. Employers always may make additional employees eligible for coverage, or otherwise offer coverage more expansively than would be required to avoid an assessable payment under the employer shared responsibility provisions.\nYes. Full-time equivalent employees are counted by combining the hours of part-time employees, each of whom individually is not a full-time employee, but who in combination count as one or more full-time employees. For purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions, the number of an employer’s full-time equivalent employees is only relevant for purposes of determining whether the employer is an ALE.\nAn ALE need not offer coverage to its part-time employees to avoid an employer shared responsibility payment, and a part-time employee’s receipt of a premium tax credit for purchasing coverage through the Marketplace cannot be the basis for liability for an employer shared responsibility payment.\nGenerally, an hour of service means each hour for which an employee is paid, or entitled to payment, for the performance of duties for the employer, and each hour for which an employee is paid, or entitled to payment, for a period of time during which no duties are performed due to vacation, holiday, illness, incapacity (including disability), layoff, jury duty, military duty or leave of absence.\nFor more information on the interaction of the rules relating to the hour of service definition in the employer shared responsibility provisions with the definition in the Department of Labor regulations, which is incorporated into the section 4980H regulations, see Notice 2015-87 PDF (question 14).\nYes. Hours for services performed in certain capacities are excluded from the definition of hour of service and not counted as hours of service for purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions:\n- Volunteer employees: Hours of service do not include hours of bona fide volunteer service for a government entity or tax-exempt organization, even if certain compensation is received for those hours.\n- Students performing work-study: Hours of service do not include hours performed by students as part of a Federal Work Study Program or a substantially similar program of a State or political subdivision.\n- Compensation that is not U.S. source income: Hours of service do not include hours for which an employee receives compensation that is taxed as income from sources outside the United States (generally meaning certain work overseas). For this purpose, the term United States refers to only the 50 States and the District of Columbia and does not include the U.S. territories.\n- Certain members of religious orders: Until further guidance is issued, under certain circumstances a religious order is permitted to not count as an hour of service work performed by an individual who is subject to a vow of poverty. For this exclusion to apply, the employee must be a member of the religious order and must be performing tasks that are usually required of active members of that order.\nTreasury and the IRS continue to consider additional rules for the determination of hours of service:\n- for certain categories of employees whose hours of service are particularly challenging to identify or track or for whom the general rules for determining hours of service may present special difficulties (including adjunct faculty, commissioned sales people and airline employees); and\n- for certain categories of work hours associated with some positions of employment, including layover hours (for example for airline employees) and on-call hours.\nUntil further guidance is issued, employers are required to use a reasonable method of crediting hours of service that is consistent with the employer shared responsibility provisions. The preamble to the final regulations includes examples of methods of crediting these hours that are reasonable and that are not reasonable, including a method that is considered reasonable for crediting hours of service for adjunct faculty members.\nIn general, for purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions, the section 414 rules for combining employers that have a certain level of common or related ownership apply for purposes of determining whether an employer employs at least 50 full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees). Under these rules, the employers that are members of an aggregated ALE group are treated as a single employer, so that all of an employee’s hours of service for any of the different employers in the group are added together to count the employee’s total hours of service.\nHowever, for purposes of determining any potential employer shared responsibility payment and applying the related information reporting requirements, if, during a calendar month, an employee is an employee of more than one member of an aggregated ALE group, the employee is treated as an employee of the employer member for whom the employee has the greatest number of hours of service for that calendar month. If the employee has an equal number of hours of service for two or more employer members of the same aggregated ALE group for the calendar month, those employers must treat one of the employers as the employer of that employee for that calendar month. For more information, see the Instructions for the Forms 1094-C and 1095-C.\nIf an employee is employed by two employers that are unrelated and, therefore, are not treated as a single employer for purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions, an employee’s hours of service for one of the employers are not treated as hours of service for the other employer.\nThe terms “seasonal employee” and “seasonal worker” have different but overlapping meanings for purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions.\nThe term “seasonal employee” is relevant for determining whether an employee is a full-time employee under the look-back measurement method. The look-back measurement method includes special rules that apply to new employees who are seasonal employees. For this purpose, a seasonal employee means an employee who is hired into a position for which the customary annual employment is six months or less and for which the period of employment begins each calendar year in approximately the same part of the year, such as summer or winter. The look-back measurement method is not available for purposes of determining whether the employer is an ALE.\nThe term “seasonal worker” is relevant for determining whether an employer is an ALE subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions. To be an ALE, an employer must have employed, during the previous calendar year, at least 50 full-time employees, including full-time equivalent employees. However, if an employer’s workforce exceeds 50 full-time employees, including full-time equivalent employees, for 120 days or fewer during the preceding calendar year, and all of the employees in excess of 50 who were employed during that period of no more than 120 days were seasonal workers, the employer is not considered an ALE. Seasonal workers are workers who perform labor or services on a seasonal basis, including seasonal workers as defined by the Department of Labor, and retail workers employed exclusively during holiday seasons. For this purpose, employers may apply a reasonable, good faith interpretation of the term “seasonal worker” and of the Department of Labor’s definition of the term “seasonal worker.” For more information about the Department of Labor definition see 29 CFR 500.20(s)(1).\nFor purposes of determining hours of service, interns are treated like all other employees. Therefore, under the general rule, an employee, including an intern, who receives no payment from an employer will not have any hours of service.\nAn employee, including an intern, who is paid, or entitled to payment, for the performance of duties (or for a period of time during which no duties are performed) will have hours of service. However, under the final regulations, an hour of service does not include any hour of service performed as a bona fide volunteer (as defined in the regulations) for a government entity or tax-exempt entity, as part of a Federal Work-Study Program (or a substantially similar program of a State or political subdivision thereof), or to the extent the compensation for services performed constitutes income from sources without the United States. See section 54.4980H-1(a)(24) of the regulations.\nOffers of coverage\nIn general, an ALE makes an offer of coverage to an employee if it provides the employee an effective opportunity to enroll in the coverage (or to decline that coverage) at least once for each plan year. Whether an employee has an effective opportunity to enroll is based on all the relevant facts and circumstances. An ALE offers coverage for a month only if the coverage would be provided for every day of that calendar month.\nFor purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions and these Q&As, “coverage” refers to minimum essential coverage that is health coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan. For more details on minimum essential coverage, see Publication 974, Premium Tax Credit.\nMandatory coverage that an ALE provides to employees only counts as an offer of coverage if that coverage meets certain requirements. If an ALE provides mandatory coverage and does not provide the employee an effective opportunity to waive or otherwise decline the coverage, the ALE is treated as having made an offer of coverage to the employee only if that mandatory coverage:\n- provides minimum value; and\n- does not require an employee contribution for any calendar month of more than 9.5 percent (as adjusted) of a monthly amount determined as the mainland federal poverty line for a single individual for the applicable calendar year, divided by 12.\nNo. An ALE is not considered to have made an offer of coverage to a full-time employee unless it provides the employee an effective opportunity to enroll in the coverage (or to decline that coverage) at least once for each plan year. Whether an employee has an effective opportunity to enroll is based on all the relevant facts and circumstances. If an ALE would terminate a full-time employee’s employment if the employee attempted to enroll in the coverage, the employee would not have an effective opportunity to enroll in the coverage. For more information about offers of coverage see section 54.4980H-4(b) and -5(b) of the regulations.\nNo. An ALE is not considered to have made an offer of coverage to a full-time employee’s dependents unless it provides the employee an effective opportunity to enroll the dependents in the coverage (or to decline that coverage) at least once for each plan year. Whether an employee has an effective opportunity to enroll his or her dependents is based on all the relevant facts and circumstances. If an ALE would terminate a full-time employee’s employment if the employee attempted to enroll his or her dependents in the coverage, the dependents would not have an effective opportunity to enroll in the coverage. For more information about offers of coverage see section 54.4980H-4(b) and -5(b) of the regulations.\nSometimes, yes. An ALE is considered to offer coverage to an employee if coverage is offered on behalf of the ALE by\n- another employer in the aggregated ALE group of employers treated as a single employer,\n- a multiemployer or single employer Taft-Hartley plan,\n- a multiple employer welfare arrangement (MEWA), or\n- in certain cases, a staffing firm.\nYes. Treasury and the IRS have provided a special rule for multiemployer arrangements. An ALE is treated as offering coverage to an employee if the ALE is required by a collective bargaining agreement or related participation agreement to make contributions for that employee to a multiemployer plan that offers, to individuals who satisfy the plan’s eligibility conditions, coverage that is affordable and provides minimum value, and that also offers coverage to those individuals’ dependents. For more information, see section XV.E of the preamble to the employer shared responsibility final regulations.\nYes. The employer shared responsibility provisions apply to ALEs regardless of whether their full-time employees have coverage from another source such as Medicare, Medicaid, or a spouse’s employer. If an ALE does not offer coverage to its full-time employees (and their dependents) or offers coverage to less than 95 percent of its full-time employees (and their dependents) and one or more of its full-time employees receives a premium tax credit, the ALE may be liable for an employer shared responsibility payment. The amount of the payment will be based on the number of the employer’s full-time employees, including full-time employees who are eligible for coverage from another source.\nHowever, certain employees are not eligible for a premium tax credit, including employees who are eligible for Medicare or Medicaid. If no full-time employee receives a premium tax credit (for example, because all of an employer’s full-time employees are eligible for Medicare or Medicaid), the employer will not be liable for an employer shared responsibility payment.\nYes. Employees who have coverage under TRICARE or a VA health program (as described in section 4980H(c)(2)(F)) are not taken into account when determining if an employer is an ALE. However, if the employer had at least 50 full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) in the preceding calendar year even after excluding employees that had coverage under TRICARE or a VA health program, the employer is subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions and all full-time employees (including those covered by TRICARE or a VA health program) are taken into account for purposes of determining and computing liability for an employer shared responsibility payment, if any.\nFor example, Employer had 150 full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) on business days in the preceding calendar year; and 50 of those employees had coverage under TRICARE or a VA health program. Employer is an ALE because, even after excluding employees with coverage under TRICARE or a VA health program, Employer had 100 full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) in the preceding calendar year. Employer is subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions and all full-time employees (including those with coverage under TRICARE or a VA health program) are taken into account for purposes of determining and computing liability for an employer shared responsibility payment, if any.\nYes. The employer shared responsibility provisions apply to ALEs with full-time employees who are exempt from the individual shared responsibility provision, such as members of a health care sharing ministry or members of a federally-recognized Indian tribe. If an ALE does not offer coverage to its full-time employees (and their dependents) or offers coverage to less than 95 percent of its full-time employees (and their dependents) and a full-time employee receives a premium tax credit, the employer will be liable for an employer shared responsibility payment, which will be calculated based on the number of the employer’s full-time employees. For this purpose, the number of full-time employees includes full-time employees who are exempt from the individual shared responsibility provision.\nEmployees who are exempt from the individual shared responsibility provision may or may not be eligible for a premium tax credit. If no full-time employee receives a premium tax credit, the employer will not be liable for an employer shared responsibility payment.\nNo. To avoid a potential employer shared responsibility payment an ALE must offer coverage that is affordable and provides minimum value to its full-time employees and must offer coverage to the dependents of those employees. But for this purpose, a spouse is not a dependent\nAffordability and minimum value\nEmployer-provided coverage is considered affordable for an employee if the employee required contribution is no more than 9.5 percent (as adjusted) of that employee’s household income. In general, the employee required contribution is the employee’s cost of enrolling in the least expensive coverage offered by the employer that provides minimum value. The employee required contribution includes amounts paid through salary reduction or otherwise, and takes into account the effects of employer arrangements such as health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs), wellness incentives, flex credits, and opt-out payments.\nIn addition, because ALEs generally do not know their employees’ household incomes, there are three affordability safe harbors employers can take advantage of that are based on information the employer does have available, such as the employee’s Form W-2 wages or the employee’s rate of pay. If an ALE’s offer of coverage is affordable using any of these safe harbors – that is, the employee’s required contribution is no more than 9.5 percent (as adjusted) of the baseline in the applicable safe harbor – then, the offer of coverage is deemed affordable for purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions regardless of whether it was affordable based on the employee’s household income (which is the test that applies for purposes of the premium tax credit).\nThe three affordability safe harbors are\n- the Form W-2 wages safe harbor,\n- the rate of pay safe harbor, and\n- the federal poverty line safe harbor.\nAn ALE may use one or more of the safe harbors at its option but only if the ALE offers 95 percent of its full-time employees and their dependents the opportunity to enroll in coverage that provides minimum value for the self-only coverage offered to the employee. An ALE may choose to use one safe harbor for all of its employees or to use different safe harbors for employees in different categories, provided that the categories used are reasonable and the employer uses one safe harbor on a uniform and consistent basis for all employees in a particular category. If an ALE offers multiple health care coverage options, the affordability test for a particular employee applies to the lowest-cost self-only coverage option that provides minimum value and that is available to that employee.\nThe Form W-2 wages safe harbor generally is based on the amount of wages paid to the employee that the employer reports in Box 1 of that employee’s Form W-2. The rate of pay safe harbor generally is based on the employee’s rate of pay at the beginning of the coverage period, with adjustments permitted, for an hourly employee, if the rate of pay is decreased (but not if the rate of pay is increased). The federal poverty line safe harbor generally treats coverage as affordable for a month if the employee required contribution for the month does not exceed 9.5 percent, adjusted annually, of the federal poverty line for a single individual for the applicable calendar year, divided by 12. The final regulations provide additional information on these affordability safe harbors.\nThe regulations under section 36B and 5000A generally contain the rules for determining the amount of the employee required contribution. For more information about affordability, including information on certain HRA contributions, wellness program incentives, flex credits, and opt-out payments, see Notice 2015-87 PDF (questions 7-12) and the proposed regulation on the premium tax credit. For more information about affordability, including information on certain HRA contributions, wellness program incentives, flex credits, and opt-out payments, see Notice 2015-87 PDF (questions 7-12) and the proposed regulation PDF on the premium tax credit.\nThe 9.5 percent affordability threshold, which applies for purposes of both the premium tax credit provisions and the employer shared responsibility affordability safe harbors, is adjusted in accordance with the threshold that applies with respect to the premium tax credit. The IRS releases the adjusted percentage each year in a revenue procedure.\n- 2015, the percentage is 9.56 percent – see Revenue Procedure 2014-37\n- 2016, the percentage is 9.66 percent – see Revenue Procedure 2014-62\n- 2017, the percentage is 9.69 percent – see Revenue Procedure 2016-24\n- 2018, the percentage is 9.56 percent – see Revenue Procedure 2017-36\n- 2019, the percentage is 9.86 percent – see Revenue Procedure 2018-34\n- 2020, the percentage is 9.78 percent – see Revenue Procedure 2019-29\n- 2021, the percentage is 9.83 percent – see Revenue Procedure 2020-36\n- 2022, the percentage is 9.61 percent – see Revenue Procedure 2021-36\n- 2023, the percentage is 9.12 percent – see Revenue Procedure 2022-34 PDF\nFor more information, including on other purposes for which the 9.5 percent threshold, as adjusted, applies, see Notice 2015-87 (question 12).\nNot necessarily. The employee required contribution may not be the same amount as the premium the employee pays for coverage if, for example:\n- the employee chooses to enroll in more expensive coverage such as family coverage; or\n- the employer, in addition to or in conjunction with the coverage, offers other arrangements that could affect the employee’s cost of coverage, including certain HRA contributions, wellness program incentives, flex credits, and opt-out payments.\nFor additional rules on determining the amount of the employee required contribution, see Notice 2015-87 PDF (questions 7-12) and the proposed regulation on the premium tax credit PDF.\nA plan provides minimum value if it covers at least 60 percent of the total allowed cost of benefits that are expected to be incurred under the plan and provides substantial coverage of inpatient hospitalization services and physician services. On May 3, 2013, Treasury and the IRS issued proposed regulations regarding how to determine minimum value and on September 1, 2015, Treasury and IRS issued proposed regulations on the requirement to provide substantial coverage of inpatient hospitalization and physician services.\nLiability for the employer shared responsibility payment\nThere are two different circumstances in which an ALE may owe an employer shared responsibility payment. An ALE is liable for an employer shared responsibility payment only if:\n(a) The ALE does not offer coverage or offers coverage to less than 95 percent of its full-time employees (and their dependents), and at least one of the full-time employee receives a premium tax credit to help pay for coverage through a Marketplace;\nOR\n(b) The ALE offers coverage to at least 95 percent of its full-time employees (and their dependents), but at least one full-time employee receives a premium tax credit to help pay for coverage through a Marketplace, which may occur because the employer did not offer coverage to that particular employee or because the coverage the employer offered that employee was either unaffordable or did not provide minimum value.\nHowever, under a special rule, if an ALE offered coverage to all but five of its full-time employees (and their dependents), and five is greater than 5 percent of the employer’s full-time employees, the employer will not owe the employer shared responsibility payment that would otherwise apply under the rule for an employer that offers coverage to less than 95 percent of its full-time employees (and their dependents).\nAlso, see Limited Transition Relief in 2016 for information about related transition relief.\nIf an employer is part of an aggregated ALE group, liability under the employer shared responsibility provisions, including the rules described in this section Liability for the Employer Shared Responsibility Payment, apply separately for each ALE member in the aggregated ALE group.\nFor purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions, a dependent is an employee’s child, including a child who has been legally adopted or legally placed for adoption with the employee, who has not reached age 26. A child reaches age 26 on the 26th anniversary of the date the child was born and is treated as a dependent for the entire calendar month during which he or she reaches age 26. For this purpose, a dependent does not include a stepchild, a foster child, or a child who does not reside in the United States or a country contiguous to the United States and who is not a United States citizen or national. For this purpose, a dependent does not include a spouse.\nYes. If an ALE is made up of multiple ALE members, each separate ALE member is liable for its own employer shared responsibility payment, if any. As a very simple example, one ALE member may fail to offer coverage and may owe an employer shared responsibility payment while another ALE member may offer coverage and not owe an employer shared responsibility payment.\nYes. In general, an employee in a “limited non-assessment period” is not considered in determining whether an employer has offered coverage sufficient to avoid an employer shared responsibility payment and an employer will not be liable for a payment for such an employee. For example, in general, an employee who is in a waiting period for coverage or who is in their first month of employment (if their first day isn’t the first day of the calendar month) would be in a limited non-assessment period. Limited non-assessment periods can apply with respect to one or both kinds of employer shared responsibility payments, depending on the coverage the employee is offered at the end of the period. For more information on these circumstances in which a payment will not be owed for a full-time employee, see the definition of limited non-assessment period for certain employees under section 54.4980H-1(a)(26) of the regulations, and see the definition of full-time employee in the Instructions for Forms 1094-C and 1095-C.\nIn addition, employees who are not full-time employees are not considered in determining whether an employer has offered coverage sufficient to avoid an employer shared responsibility payment, and an employer will not be liable for a payment for such an employee.\nNo. The Marketplace may notify certain employers whose employees enroll in coverage and are determined eligible for advance payments of the premium tax credit (because the employee has attested that he or she is not enrolled in employer-sponsored coverage and is not eligible for affordable employer-sponsored coverage that provides minimum value). The employer notice from the Marketplace does not determine an employer’s potential liability under the employer shared responsibility provisions, and an appeal to the Marketplace does not affect the employer shared responsibility provisions in any way. The Marketplace employer notice only serves as an indicator to employers about potential liability for an employer shared responsibility payment. The IRS independently will determine any liability for the employer shared responsibility payment.\nNo. An employer that is not an ALE is not subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions and will not owe an employer shared responsibility payment, regardless of whether one, some or all of its employees receive a premium tax credit for coverage through the Marketplace.\nNo. An ALE that offers coverage that is affordable and that provides minimum value to all its full-time employees and offers coverage to the dependents of those employees will not be subject to an employer shared responsibility payment.\nIn general, an employee will not be eligible for a premium tax credit if the ALE has offered that employee coverage that is affordable and that provides minimum value, even if that employee does not take the offer of coverage and instead enrolls in coverage through a Marketplace. If no full-time employee receives a premium tax credit, the ALE will not be liable for an employer shared responsibility payment.\nFurther, as a result of differences in the meaning of affordability for purposes of the premium tax credit and the employer shared responsibility provisions, it is possible that an employee may be eligible for a premium tax credit but the ALE is not liable for an employer shared responsibility payment for that employee. As long as the ALE made the employee an offer of minimum value coverage that was affordable, within the meaning of the employer shared responsibility provisions, the ALE will not be liable for an employer shared responsibility payment for the employee.\nNo. To avoid a potential employer shared responsibility payment an ALE must generally offer coverage to the dependents of full-time employees, among other requirements. For this purpose, a spouse is not a dependent. An ALE will not be subject to an employer shared responsibility payment solely because it does not offer coverage to an employee’s spouse. This is the case regardless of whether the spouse purchases health insurance coverage through a Marketplace and receives the financial assistance, such as the premium tax credit.\nFor more information about eligibility for the premium tax credit, see the final regulations under section 36B and questions and answers on the premium tax credit.\nNo. Although an ALE must generally offer coverage to the dependents of its full-time employees to avoid an employer shared responsibility payment, an ALE will not be liable for an employer shared responsibility payment solely because one or more of its employees’ spouses or dependents purchase coverage through a Marketplace. An ALE will not be potentially liable for an employer shared responsibility payment unless a full-time employee receives a premium tax credit for the employee’s coverage. If no full-time employee receives a premium tax credit, the ALE will not be subject to an employer shared responsibility payment.\nFor more information about eligibility for a premium tax credit, see the final regulations under section 36B and questions and answers on the premium tax credit.\nNo. An ALE will not be subject to an employer shared responsibility payment solely because one or more of its employees (or their spouses or dependents) enroll in Medicare or Medicaid. An ALE will not be potentially liable for an employer shared responsibility payment unless at least one full-time employee enrolls in Marketplace coverage and receives financial assistance, such as the premium tax credit.\nCalculation of the employer shared responsibility payment\nIf an ALE does not offer coverage or offers coverage to less than 95 percent of its full-time employees (and their dependents) for an entire calendar year, and at least one of its full-time employees receives a premium tax credit, the ALE owes an employer shared responsibility payment equal to the number of full-time employees the ALE employed for the calendar year (minus up to 30) multiplied by $2,000 (as adjusted).\nFor an ALE that offers coverage to at least 95 percent of its full-time employees (and their dependents) for some months but not others during the calendar year, the payment is computed separately for each month it does not offer coverage to at least 95 percent of its full-time employees (and their dependents). The amount of the payment for each month equals the number of full-time employees the ALE employed for the month (minus up to 30) multiplied by 1/12 of $2,000 (as adjusted). If the ALE is related to other ALE members in an aggregated ALE group (see Employers Subject to the Employer Shared Responsibility Provisions above), the 30-employee reduction is allocated among all the ALE members in the aggregated ALE group in proportion to the number of full-time employees each ALE member has. And if the employer is part of an aggregated ALE group, the payment is calculated based only on the number of full-time employees of the particular ALE member.\nPart-time employees and full-time equivalent employees are not counted for this calculation. Also, certain full-time employees are not included in this payment calculation, for example, very generally, a full-time employee in a waiting period. For more information on the circumstances in which a full-time employee is not counted for this payment, see the definition of limited non-assessment period for certain employees under section 54.4980H-1(a)(26) of the regulations, and see the definition of full-time employee in the Instructions for Forms 1094-C and 1095-C.\nSee Limited Transition Relief in 2016 for information on related transition relief. For examples of a payment calculation, see the Types of Employer Payments and How They are Calculated page.\nFor an ALE that offers coverage to at least 95 percent of its full-time employees (and their dependents), but has one or more full-time employees who receive a premium tax credit, the payment is computed separately for each month. The amount of the payment for the month equals the number of full-time employees who receive a premium tax credit for that month multiplied by 1/12 of $3,000 (as adjusted). The amount of the payment for any calendar month is capped at the number of the ALE’s full-time employees for the month (minus up to 30) multiplied by 1/12 of $2,000 (as adjusted). The cap ensures that the payment for an ALE that offers coverage can never exceed the payment that ALE would owe if it did not offer coverage.\nIf an employer is a member of an aggregated ALE group, the payment is calculated based only on the number of full-time employees of the particular ALE member.\nPart-time employees and full-time equivalent employees are not counted for this calculation. Also, certain full-time employees are not included in this payment calculation, for example, very generally, a full-time employee in a waiting period. For more information on the circumstances in which a full-time employee is not counted for this payment, see the definition of limited non-assessment period for certain employees under section 54.4980H-1(a)(26) of the regulations and see the definition of full-time employee in the Instructions for Forms 1094-C and 1095-C. For detailed examples of a payment calculation, see the Types of Employer Payments and How They are Calculated page.\nYes. The employer shared responsibility provisions provide for an inflation adjustment beginning in calendar years after 2014.\nIn the case of any calendar year after 2014, the applicable per-employee dollar amounts of $2,000 and $3,000 are increased based on the premium adjustment percentage (as defined in section 1302(c)(4) of the Affordable Care Act) for the year, rounded to the next lowest multiple of $10.\n- For calendar year 2015, the adjusted $2,000 amount is $2,080 and the adjusted $3,000 amount is $3,120.\n- For calendar year 2016, the adjusted $2,000 amount is $2,160 and the adjusted $3,000 amount is $3,240.\n- For calendar year 2017, the adjusted $2,000 amount is $2,260 and the adjusted $3,000 amount is $3,390.\n- For calendar year 2018, the adjusted $2,000 amount is $2,320 and the adjusted $3,000 amount is $3,480.\n- For calendar year 2019, the adjusted $2,000 amount is $2,500 and the adjusted $3,000 amount is $3,750.\n- For calendar year 2020, the adjusted $2,000 amount is $2,570 and the adjusted $3,000 amount is $3,860.\n- For calendar year 2021, the adjusted $2,000 amount is $2,700 and the adjusted $3,000 amount is $4,060.\n- For calendar year 2022, the adjusted $2,000 amount is $2,750 and the adjusted $3,000 amount is $4,120.\n- For calendar year 2023, the adjusted $2,000 amount is $2,880 and the adjusted $3,000 amount is $4,320.\nFor more details see Notice 2015-87 (question 13).\nMaking an employer shared responsibility payment\nThe general procedures the IRS will use to propose and assess the employer shared responsibility payment are described in Letter 226J. The IRS plans to issue Letter 226J to an ALE if it determines that, for at least one month in the year, one or more of the ALE’s full-time employees was enrolled in a qualified health plan for which a premium tax credit was allowed (and the ALE did not qualify for an affordability safe harbor or other relief for the employee).\nLetter 226J will include:\n- a brief explanation of section 4980H,\n- an employer shared responsibility payment summary table itemizing the proposed payment by month and indicating for each month if the liability is under section 4980H(a) or section 4980H(b) or neither,\n- an explanation of the employer shared responsibility payment summary table,\n- an employer shared responsibility response form, Form 14764, ESRP Response PDF,\n- an employee PTC list, Form 14765, Employee Premium Tax Credit (PTC) List PDF which lists, by month, the ALE’s assessable full-time employees (individuals who for at least one month in the year were full-time employees allowed a premium tax credit and for whom the ALE did not qualify for an affordability safe harbor or other relief (see instructions for Forms 1094-C and 1095-C, Line 16), and the indicator codes, if any, the ALE reported on lines 14 and 16 of each assessable full-time employee’s Form 1095-C,\n- a description of the actions the ALE should take if it agrees or disagrees with the proposed employer shared responsibility payment in Letter 226J, and\n- a description of the actions the IRS will take if the ALE does not respond timely to Letter 226J.\nThe response to Letter 226J will be due by the response date shown on Letter 226J, which generally will be 30 days from the date of Letter 226J.\nLetter 226J will contain the name and contact information of a specific IRS employee that the ALE should contact if the ALE has questions about the letter.\nYes. ALEs will have an opportunity to respond to Letter 226J before any employer shared responsibility liability is assessed and notice and demand for payment is made. Letter 226J will provide instructions for how the ALE should respond in writing, either agreeing with the proposed employer shared responsibility payment or disagreeing with part or all of the proposed amount.\nIf the ALE responds to Letter 226J, the IRS will acknowledge the ALE’s response to Letter 226J with an appropriate version of Letter 227 (a series of five different letters that, in general, acknowledge the ALE’s response to Letter 226J and describe further actions the ALE may need to take). If, after receipt of Letter 227, the ALE disagrees with the proposed or revised employer shared responsibility payment, the ALE may request a pre-assessment conference with the IRS Office of Appeals. The ALE should follow the instructions provided in Letter 227 and Publication 5, Your Appeal Rights and How To Prepare a Protest if You Don’t Agree PDF, for requesting a conference with the IRS Office of Appeals. A conference should be requested in writing by the response date shown on Letter 227, which generally will be 30 days from the date of Letter 227.\nIf the ALE does not respond to either Letter 226J or Letter 227, the IRS will assess the amount of the proposed employer shared responsibility payment and issue a notice and demand for payment, Notice CP 220J.\nIf, after correspondence between the ALE and the IRS or a conference with the IRS Office of Appeals, the IRS or IRS Office of Appeals determines that an ALE is liable for an employer shared responsibility payment, the IRS will assess the employer shared responsibility payment and issue a notice and demand for payment, Notice CP 220J. Notice CP 220J will include a summary of the employer shared responsibility payment and will reflect payments made, credits applied, and the balance due, if any. That notice will instruct the ALE how to make payment, if any. ALEs will not be required to include the employer shared responsibility payment on any tax return that they file or to make payment before notice and demand for payment. For payment options, such as entering into an installment agreement, refer to Publication 594, The IRS Collection Process PDF.\nIn 2018 the IRS began issuing Letter 226J for the 2015 calendar year informing ALEs of their potential liability for an employer shared responsibility payment, if any, in late 2017.\nFor purposes of Letter 226J, the IRS determination of whether an employer may be liable for an employer shared responsibility payment and the amount of the potential payment are based on information reported to the IRS on Forms 1094-C and 1095-C and information about full-time employees of the ALE that were allowed the premium tax credit.\nLimited transition relief in 2016\nYes, but only with respect to employer coverage with a plan year that is different than the calendar year (referred to as a non-calendar-year plan) and only for employers that meet the other requirements for the applicable relief. Several forms of transition relief under the employer shared responsibility provisions were available for calendar year 2015. Because employers generally offer coverage for a 12-month plan year and some plan years are different than the calendar year, certain forms of transition relief are available to plan years that began in calendar year 2015 and end in calendar year 2016 (the 2015 plan year).\nFor additional information on the transition relief that applied in calendar 2015, see section XV of the preamble to the final regulations.\nFor 2014, transition relief was available such that no payments under the employer shared responsibility provisions are assessed. See Notice 2013-45 PDF.\nYes, but only for certain employers that offer non-calendar-year plans. In particular, for calendar months in the 2015 plan year that fall within 2016, an ALE (or ALE member, if part of an aggregated ALE group) may treat an offer of coverage to a full-time employee but not his or her dependents as an offer of coverage to both the full-time employee and his or her dependents, but only if certain requirements are met. Specifically, this transition relief applies only if an employee was not offered dependent coverage during the plan year beginning in 2013 or 2014 and the ALE (or ALE member) took steps during the 2014 or 2015 plan year (or both) to extend coverage under the plan to dependents not offered coverage during the 2013 or 2014 plan years (or both). This rule applies solely for purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions.\nYes, but only for certain employers that offer non-calendar-year plans and only for calendar months in the 2015 plan year that fall within 2016. To qualify for this relief, an ALE must certify that it meets the following conditions:\n- Limited workforce size: The ALE must have employed on average at least 50 full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) but fewer than 100 full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) on business days during 2014. The number of full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) is determined in accordance with the otherwise applicable rules for determining status as an ALE.\n- Maintenance of workforce and aggregate hours of service: During the period beginning on February 9, 2014 and ending on December 31, 2014, the ALE did not reduce the size of its workforce or the overall hours of service of its employees in order to qualify for the transition relief. However, an ALE that reduces workforce size or overall hours of service for bona fide business reasons is still eligible for the relief.\n- Maintenance of previously offered coverage: During the period beginning on February 9, 2014 and ending on the last day of the 2015 plan year, the ALE does not eliminate or materially reduce the coverage, if any, it offered as of February 9, 2014. For more details see section XV.D.6 of the preamble to the employer shared responsibility provisions final regulations.\nAn ALE member that is part of an aggregated ALE group that meets these criteria will not be subject to an assessable payment for any calendar month in 2016 that falls within the 2015 plan year of a plan offered by either the ALE member or another member of the aggregated ALE group, if applicable.\nIf any ALE member, or different members in an aggregated ALE group, offer coverage under more than one health plan with different plan years, the transition relief applies through the last day of the latest of those plan years, for all ALE members in the aggregated ALE group, if applicable.\nYes, but only for employers that offer non-calendar-year plans and only for calendar months in 2016 that fall within the 2015 plan year. In particular, for calendar months in 2016 that fall within the 2015 plan year, an ALE member can avoid the (generally larger) $2,000-per-full-time-employee payment (as adjusted) under section 4980H(a) by offering coverage to at least than 70 percent of its full-time employees (and their dependents). Such an employer may still be liable for a payment under section 4980H(b) of $3,000 (as adjusted) for each full-time employee who receives a premium tax credit to help purchase coverage through a Marketplace. This payment is generally smaller in aggregate than the $2,000 per-full-time-employee payment under section 4980H(a) (and can never be larger).\nIf the ALE member offers coverage under more than one health plan with different plan years, this transition relief applies through the last day of the latest of those plan years.\nYes, but only for certain employers that offer non-calendar-year plans and only for calendar months in 2016 that fall within the 2015 plan year, as described below.\nFor the months described below, if an ALE member that is an ALE (or part of an aggregated ALE group) that had at least 100 full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) on business days in 2014 does not offer coverage to at least 95 percent (or 70 percent, if applicable) of its full-time employees (and their dependents), it may be liable for an employer shared responsibility payment equal to the number of full-time employees the ALE member employed for the month minus up to 80 multiplied by 1/12 of $2,000 (as adjusted), if at least one full-time employee receives a premium tax credit for that month. Under the normal rules, employers subtract 30 from the number of full-time employees in this calculation but the transition relief allows subtraction of 80.\nFor 2016, this relief applies for an ALE member with at least one non-calendar-year plan and for an ALE member that is a member of an aggregated ALE group with at least one non-calendar-year plan, for the months in 2016 that fall within the 2015 plan year. If an ALE member, or different members in an aggregated ALE group, offer coverage under more than one health plan with different plan years, the transition relief applies through the last day of the latest of those plan years, for all ALE members in the aggregated ALE group, if applicable. For the rules on how the 80-employee-reduction is allocated among the ALE members in an aggregated ALE group, see section 54.4980H-4(e) of the regulations.\nRelated provisions\nThe premium tax credit generally is available to help pay for coverage for individuals who\n- have household income of at least 100 percent but not more than 400 percent of the federal poverty line and enroll in coverage through a Marketplace,\n- are not eligible for coverage through a government-sponsored program like Medicaid or CHIP, and\n- are not eligible for coverage offered by an employer or are eligible only for employer coverage that is unaffordable or that does not provide minimum value.\nNo. The rules for determining an employee’s eligibility for the premium tax credit, including whether the employee was offered employer-sponsored coverage, apply regardless of whether the employer is subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services administers the requirements for the Marketplace and the health plans offered through the Marketplace.

More information is available in the IRS Statement about Letter 6534.\nThe premium tax credit – also known as PTC – is a refundable credit that helps eligible individuals and families cover the premiums for their health insurance purchased through the Health Insurance Marketplace. To get this credit, you must meet certain requirements and file a tax return with Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit (PTC).\n2021 and 2022 PTC Eligibility. For tax years 2021 and 2022, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) temporarily expanded eligibility for the premium tax credit by eliminating the rule that a taxpayer with household income above 400% of the federal poverty line cannot qualify for a premium tax credit.\n2021 Unemployment Compensation. If you, or your spouse (if filing a joint return), received, or were approved to receive, unemployment compensation for any week beginning during 2021, the amount of your household income is considered to be no greater than 133% of the federal poverty line for your family size and you are considered to have met the household income requirements for eligibility for a premium tax credit. Keep any supporting documentation related to receiving or the approval to receive unemployment compensation with your tax return records.\nYou are eligible for the premium tax credit if you meet all of the following requirements. You:\n- Have household income that falls within a certain range.\n- If you, or your spouse (if filing a joint return), received, or is approved to receive, unemployment compensation for any week beginning during 2021, your household income is considered to fall within this range.\n- Do not file a tax return using the filing status of Married Filing Separately.\n- There is an exception to this rule that allows certain victims of domestic abuse and spousal abandonment to claim the credit using Married Filing Separately; for more information, see the Premium Tax Credit questions and answers.\n- Cannot be claimed as a dependent by another person.\n- Meet these additional requirements: In the same month, you or a family member:\n- Have health insurance coverage through a Health Insurance Marketplace for which the share of the premium not covered by advance credit payments is paid by the due date of your return.\n- Are not able to get affordable coverage through an eligible employer-sponsored plan that provides minimum value.\n- Are not eligible for coverage through a government program, like Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP or TRICARE.\nFor more information about these eligibility requirements see Eligibility for the Premium Tax Credit.\nWhen you enroll, the Marketplace will determine if you are eligible for advance payments of the premium tax credit, also called advance credit payments or APTC. Advance credit payments are amounts paid to your insurance company on your behalf to lower the out-of-pocket cost for your health insurance premiums.\nFor more information about the premium tax credit, see our Questions and Answers and other guidance PDF.\nIf you benefit from advance payments of the premium tax credit, it is important to report life changes to the Marketplace as they happen throughout the year.\nCertain changes to your household, income or family size may affect the amount of your premium tax credit. These changes can alter your tax refund, or cause you to owe tax. Reporting these changes promptly will help you get the proper type and amount of financial assistance. For more information, see the Changes in Circumstances section of our Claiming the Credit and Reconciling Advance Credit Payments page.\nFor tax years other than 2020, if you get the benefit of advance credit payments in any amount – or if you plan to claim the premium tax credit – you must file a federal income tax return and attach Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit (PTC), to your return. You claim the premium tax credit and reconcile the credit with the amount of your advance credit payments for the year on Form 8962.\nYou must file a return to reconcile the credit with the amount of your advance credit payments even if you’re usually not required to file. Filing your return without reconciling your advance credit payments will delay your refund and may affect your eligibility for future advance credit payments. For more information on filing a return to claim and reconcile the credit see Premium Tax Credit: Claiming the Credit and Reconciling Advance Credit Payments.\nFiling electronically is the easiest way to file a complete and accurate tax return. Electronic filing options include free volunteer assistance, IRS Free File, commercial software and professional assistance.\nThe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), enacted on March 11, 2021, suspended the requirement to repay excess advance payments of the premium tax credit (excess APTC, which is the amount by which your advance credit payments for the year exceed your premium tax credit for the year) for tax year 2020.\nIf you already filed a 2020 return and reported excess APTC or made an excess APTC repayment, you don’t need to file an amended return or take any other action. The IRS will reduce the excess APTC repayment amount to zero with no further action needed by the taxpayer. The IRS will reimburse people who have already repaid any excess advance Premium Tax Credit on their 2020 tax return. Taxpayers who received a letter about a missing Form 8962 should disregard the letter if they have excess APTC for 2020. The IRS will process tax returns without Form 8962 for tax year 2020 by reducing the excess APTC repayment amount to zero.\nIf you have not filed your 2020 tax return, here’s what to do:\n- If you have excess APTC for 2020, you are not required to report it on your 2020 tax return or file Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit (PTC).\n- If you’re claiming a net premium tax credit for 2020, you must file Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit (PTC).\nFor details see the Tax Year 2020 Premium Tax Credit:\nFor tax years other than 2020, if you get the benefit of advance credit payments in any amount – or if you plan to claim the premium tax credit – you must file a federal income tax return and attach Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit (PTC), to your return. You claim the premium tax credit and reconcile the credit with the amount of your advance credit payments for the year on Form 8962.\nFor tax years other than 2020, you must file a return to reconcile the credit with the amount of your advance credit payments even if you’re usually not required to file. Filing your return without reconciling your advance credit payments will delay your refund and may affect your eligibility for future advance credit payments.

Electronic filing options include free volunteer assistance, IRS Free File, commercial software and professional assistance.\nUnder ARPA, eligible taxpayers are allowed to exclude up to $10,200 of unemployment compensation received in 2020 on their 2020 Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. Beginning in July 2021, the IRS reviewed tax returns filed prior to the enactment of ARPA to identify tax returns on which both excludible unemployment compensation and excess APTC repayments were reported by the taxpayer. Taxpayers received letters from the IRS, generally within 30 days of the adjustment, informing them of what kind of adjustment was made (such as refund, payment of IRS debt payment or payment offset for other authorized debts) and the amount of the adjustment. For taxpayers who reported both excludible unemployment income and APTC, the adjustment should have covered both items even though the IRS’s communication to the taxpayer may have mentioned only unemployment compensation.\nHowever, if, because of the excluded unemployment compensation, taxpayers are now eligible for deductions or credits not claimed on the original return, they should file a Form 1040-X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return for tax year 2020. See 2020 Unemployment Compensation Exclusion FAQs — Topic D: Amended Return (Form 1040-X) for more information.\nForm 1095-A, Health Insurance Marketplace Statement\nYour Marketplace will provide Form 1095-A if you or one of your dependents had coverage through a Marketplace.

Gavin Newsom. He has one month to sign or veto any measures passed in the final days before the session ended Sept. 13.\nAs his attention turns ever more toward national politics, how might Newsom’s approach change this year? What bill signings will he highlight to the public or bury in a late-night news dump? Could he veto more proposals as he tries to distance himself from contentious liberal policies and chart a more moderate image?\nLast year, Newsom vetoed about 18% of nearly 1,000 bills passed in the final days (and nearly 16% of all 1,200 bills passed by the Legislature in 2024). That was already higher than his historical average.\nTypically, the governor gives a few reasons for vetoing bills: He deems them bad policy or redundant or calculates that their potential cost threatens to worsen the state’s budget situation. But he also blocks bills because they’re controversial or opposed by powerful special interests.\nWhile the Legislature can override vetoes, it takes a two-thirds vote in both the Assembly and Senate, which rarely happens. Governors can also allow bills to become law without their signature, but that doesn’t occur very often, either.\nHere are some noteworthy bills CalMatters reporters are tracking. Bookmark this page for updates.\n✅ Extend California's cap-and-trade program to 2045\nWHAT THE BILLS WOULD DO\nAssembly Bill 1207 by Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, a Democrat from Thousand Oaks, and SB 840 by Sen. Monique Limón, a Democrat from Santa Barbara, respectively reauthorize the state’s landmark cap-and-trade climate program and provide a blueprint for how lawmakers should spend the billions of dollars it generates.\nCap and trade, renamed “cap and invest,” is California’s way of putting a price tag on greenhouse gas emissions — those responsible for climate change. The state sets a strict cap on those emissions and hands out a limited supply of permits. Companies that cut their pollution enough can sell excess permits, creating a market incentive to address climate change.\nThe reauthorization makes slight changes to how the California Air Resources Board distributes free “allowances” — or pollution permits — to various types of greenhouse gas emitters. But the bill leaves most potential future policy changes up to the air board.\nMeanwhile, the funding bill reshapes how some of the money raised from businesses is spent, notably guaranteeing $1 billion a year for California’s troubled high-speed rail project and $1 billion a year for lawmakers to assign through the budget.\nWHO SUPPORTS IT\nGov. Gavin Newsom, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire negotiated the deal in the final days of the state’s legislative session. The reauthorization was supported by a host of mainstream environmental groups, including the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council, construction trade unions and notable climate activists, including billionaire San Francisco Tom Steyer and former Gov. Jerry Brown.\nWHO IS OPPOSED\nThe California Chamber of Commerce led the opposition, while the oil industry’s main trade group, after initially resisting reauthorization, shifted to a neutral stance. On the other side, environmental justice advocates stayed firmly opposed, arguing the program propped up oil and gas at the expense of vulnerable communities near refineries and other polluting industries.\nWHY IT MATTERS\nCap and trade is considered one of California’s most important tools for pricing carbon and generating billions for climate programs. Extending it gives industry certainty and secures funding at a time of budget shortfalls and federal rollbacks under the Trump administration. But it also highlights divisions between climate advocates, industry, and communities living near pollution.\nGOVERNOR’S CALL ✅\n✅ Expand oil drilling in Kern County\nWHAT THE BILL WOULD DO\nDrill, baby, drill! Senate Bill 237 by state Sen. Tim Grayson, an Orinda Democrat, could get oil pumping again in California by granting blanket approval for environmental reviews of Kern County wells — a strategy to sidestep litigation that has long been sought by local producers. But the measure would also create new standards for restarting idle pipelines that could block a controversial offshore drilling project in Santa Barbara County. Other provisions would allow the governor to suspend California’s summer gasoline blend, a specially formulated fuel to reduce air pollution, to protect consumers against price spikes and to direct state regulators to study the feasibility of developing a Western regional gas formulation.\nWHO SUPPORTS IT\nThe oil industry has been pleading for years for relief from California’s strict environmental rules, which it blames for driving up gasoline prices in the state to among the highest in the country. At the top of its wish list was unleashing domestic production, a cheaper way to meet demand than importing crude oil from foreign countries. With at least two of California’s last remaining fuel refineries now closing sooner than expected, potentially raising costs at the pump even further, Gov. Gavin Newsom and other Democrats who previously saw the oil industry as a political enemy were suddenly willing to come to the negotiating table.\nWHO IS OPPOSED\nEnvironmental groups feel betrayed. California has been a leader in climate action for decades, fast-tracking a transition to clean energy that phases out a reliance on fossil fuels. Opponents see this deal as a major step backward and an industry giveaway. They argue that oil companies falsely linked the refinery closures to drilling, creating urgency for the state to adopt a policy that will pad their profits without actually reducing gasoline prices.\nWHY IT MATTERS\nAffordability was the buzzword this legislative session, and nowhere is the cost of living more immediately visible to Californians than in the rise and fall of gasoline prices. Unthinkable even a few years ago, this olive branch to the oil industry was Newsom’s bid to stave off a politically toxic surge in what drivers pay at the pump. It could also mark a significant turning point in California’s relationship with an industry that had become a favorite political boogeyman for Democrats. Oil refiners are likely to seek further changes next year to avoid a doom spiral in the market.\nGOVERNOR’S CALL ✅\n✅ Create a Western energy market\nWHAT THE BILL WOULD DO\nAssembly Bill 825 by Democratic Assemblymembers Cottie Petrie-Norris of Irvine and Sen. Josh Becker of Menlo Park, would open the door for California to join a Western regional energy market, aiming to save customers money by allowing electricity to flow more freely across state lines and steadying the grid when power is needed most, like during a heat wave.\nThe bill repeals an older process for turning California’s grid operator into a regional body and replaces it with a new framework developed through years of talks among Western power companies, system operators, regulators and others.\nThe law would open the door to a shared electricity market across Western states while aiming to have each state retain control of its own energy policies and planning. An expanded market could include climate-aligned states such as Oregon and Washington but potentially also coal-burning states such as Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico.\nWHO SUPPORTS IT\nCalifornia often wastes solar power on mild spring and fall days when production outpaces demand, and that’s one of the biggest reasons environmental groups including the Environmental Defense Fund and Natural Resources Defense Council back this measure. They said a regional market would allow the state to sell surplus solar to its neighbors and tap renewable energy from other states.\nThose big environmental groups are joined by major utilities and industry players — including Google and Microsoft, eager to power new AI data centers — as well as the statewide electrical workers’ union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.\nWHO IS OPPOSED\nThe Utility Reform Network opposes the bill after key safeguards it negotiated were stripped from the final plan. TURN advocates for ratepayers, but said the bigger danger from the plan is California ceding control of its renewable energy agenda to a federal government that is openly hostile to clean energy — a risk the group said outweighs any potential savings. TURN is joined in opposition by other consumer and environmental groups.\nWHY IT MATTERS\nCalifornia spent decades greening its grid: ditching coal, slashing fossil fuels and building the world’s second-largest battery fleet to store solar power after dark. This bill would take a major step toward linking that system to other parts of the country, reshaping how clean and fossil power move across the West.\nGOVERNOR’S CALL ✅\n✅ Add $18 billion to California wildfire recovery fund\nBy Jeanne Kuang\nWHAT THE BILL WOULD DO\nSenate Bill 254 by Sens. Josh Becker, Cottie Petrie-Norris and Aisha Wahab would boost the state’s wildfire liability fund, which is paid for by the big three utility companies’ shareholders and customers. The fund, which pays victims of wildfires caused by utility infrastructure, is running low from claims stemming from this January’s Eaton Fire. The $18 billion boost over 10 years would be split equally between shareholders and ratepayers, who contribute to the fund through a charge on their bills. The bill also includes new regulations on the three investor-owned utilities, preventing utilities from profiting from $6 billion worth of wildfire-proofing work (such as moving power lines underground). It would also set up a program for the state to help publicly finance the cost of building new transmission lines, a significant factor in energy bills, and fast-track some permitting for solar and other clean energy projects.\nWHO SUPPORTS IT\nThe bill is part of a package of climate and energy policies negotiated between legislative leaders, who wanted to try to curb utilities rates, and Gov. Gavin Newsom, who wanted to replenish the wildfire fund. It’s backed by mainstream environmental groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council and consumer advocates such as The Utility Reform Network. The California Chamber of Commerce, initially opposed, has since gotten on board after the bill was amended to include the wildfire fund.\nWHO IS OPPOSED\nA group representing some past wildfire survivors says the measure doesn’t go far enough for them, arguing the wildfire fund has benefitted utilities and their shareholders at the expense of homeowners and residents who struggle with the legal process to get paid. Some electricity users’ advocates also are frustrated consumers would have to continue paying into the fund.\nWHY IT MATTERS\nIn the grand energy policy bargain of California leaders trying all at once to maintain climate goals, keep energy flowing reliably and drive down costs, SB 254 represents the latter portion of those efforts. While other parts of the deal boost oil drilling or expand energy markets, this bill contains the more progressive of this year’s energy proposals that reflect Democrats’ desire to lower prices by regulating utilities.\nGOVERNOR’S CALL ✅\n✅ Allow more housing near transit\nWHAT THE BILL WOULD DO\nHousing developers would be allowed to build apartment buildings up to seven stories within a walkable half-mile of many major train, light-rail, subway and high-frequency rapid bus stations — even if local zoning restrictions would otherwise ban such dense development. Authored by San Francisco Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener, Senate Bill 79 would also let public transit agencies build apartments on their own land. Developers would be required to set aside a small share of the new units they build under the law for low-income renters. The bill would only apply in counties with significant passenger rail systems in place — that is, major metro areas.\nWHO SUPPORTS IT\nPeople who want to see the state build a lot more housing and those who want to boost the ridership numbers and financial sustainability of California’s public transit systems lined up behind the bill. The coalition includes “Yes In My Backyard” activists, many construction worker unions, business groups and transit rider advocates. Supporters say building apartment buildings near public transit hubs will both address the state’s chronic shortage of lower-cost housing and encourage more residents to take the train or bus — a win for transit systems, traffic and the climate.\nWHO IS OPPOSED\nPlenty of local governments are opposed because they don’t want the state bigfooting their authority over what gets built where. Many neighborhood groups and homeowners associations don’t like it either, as it threatens to foist new development and density on their communities. A handful of advocates for low-income Californians are also opposed, arguing that the bill does not go far enough in mandating that the new units be restricted for low earners.\nWHY IT MATTERS\nFor nearly a decade now a growing cohort of California lawmakers have been writing bills aimed at making it easier to build more homes to tackle the state’s dearth of affordable housing. SB 79 would represent one of the largest state-directed densification efforts to date. It’s also a bill that, in one form or another, Wiener has been trying and failing to get passed since the beginning of his legislative career.\nGOVERNOR’S CALL ✅\n✅ Require AI to test for 'catastrophic' risk\nWHAT THE BILL WOULD DO\nSenate Bill 53 by Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, requires AI makers to test AI models for their ability to enable things like cybersecurity crimes or biological weapons attacks and would give developers and the public a way to report AI that poses a catastrophic risk. Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a previous version of the bill last year. A report ordered by Newsom released in June calls for rules to protect whistleblowers and transparency in the model development process to balance innovation with guardrails.\nThe bill defines catastrophic risk as an AI model that demonstrates the ability to cause the death or injury of 50 or more people, or more than $1 billion in damage or loss of property. Only companies that make $500 million or more annually must comply with the law.\nWHO SUPPORTS IT\nThe bill is supported by organizations like Tech Oversight California, independent state oversight group Little Hoover Commission, the Service Employees International Union and several groups concerned that AI can go rogue and harm people.\n“While we believe that frontier AI safety is best addressed at the federal level instead of a patchwork of state regulations, powerful AI advancements won’t wait for consensus in Washington,” said Anthropic, a business founded by former OpenAI employees.\nIt’s unclear if the final version will win the governor’s support, but co-sponsor Encode told CalMatters that the governor’s office helped shape final amendments to the bill.\nWHO IS OPPOSED\nBusiness groups like the Chamber of Commerce and TechNet oppose the legislation, along with OpenAI, which argue instead for a national policy set by lawmakers in Washington D.C.\nWHY IT MATTERS\nThis bill gives the public and people inside companies developing AI an easy way to alert authorities if the tech shows an ability to cause great harm. The legislation states that “timely reporting of critical safety incidents to the government is essential to ensure that public authorities are promptly informed of ongoing and emerging risks to public safety.”\nAI researchers have called for whistleblower protections before, because of concerns about how AI can amplify existing inequality and with the hypothetical ways the tech may harm people in the future.\nThe legislation would also require companies to publish details about how they evaluate models for catastrophic risk on their websites, and establishes CalCompute, a public cloud that must focus on developing AI for the public good.\nGOVERNOR’S CALL ✅\n✅Limit algorithms that set dynamic pricing\nWHAT THE BILL WOULD DO\nLandlords, grocery stores, and tech platforms like Amazon, Airbnb and Instacart can use algorithms to rip you off in a variety of ways. To prevent businesses from charging customers higher costs and make life more affordable, Assembly Bill 325 would prohibit tech platforms from requiring independent businesses to use their pricing recommendations. Among half a dozen bills introduced this year to address the problem, it’s the only bill that made it to the governor’s desk. Key examples cited by author Cecilia Aguilar-Curry, a Davis Democrat, include Realpage, which sets the cost of apartment rentals, and Cendyn, a tool used by hotels to set prices, though a case against Las Vegas hotels for using that tool was recently thrown out.\nWHO SUPPORTS IT\nLawmakers and supporters of the bill say algorithms eliminate fair market competition. In the past, businesses or competitors would go into a room and collude to increase the cost for a particular good, but today they can just use an algorithm, said Sen. Melissa Hurtado, a Democrat from Bakersfield, author of another algorithmic pricing bill that failed. Whether done by people in a room or with digital tools, price-fixing is wrong, said Aguilar-Curry, who has said she believes the algorithms play an important role in California’s affordability crisis. Attorney General Rob Bonta, prominent unions, and the Consumer Federation of California are among supporters of AB 325.\nWHO IS OPPOSED\nGroups representing apartment landlords, hospitals, hotels, restaurants, retailers, and tech industry groups oppose this legislation. The California Chamber of Commerce maintains that AB 325 will drive up costs.\nWHY IT MATTERS\nAcross industries and markets, when centralized platforms set prices, we lose the competition that drives prices down, said Lee Hepner, a lawyer at the American Economic Liberties Project, who supports AB 325.\nSuch pricing practices have led to federal lawsuits against businesses like RealPage and Agri Stats, whose practices could have led to higher costs of meat in grocery stores. A 2024 White House study estimated that price-fixing algorithms cost apartment renters $3.8 billion in 2023, amounting to higher rents nationwide, including $99 more a month in San Diego, $62 more a month in San Francisco, and $34 a month more in Los Angeles. Lawmakers in nearly 20 states are considering regulation to prevent rent price fixing.\nGOVERNOR’S CALL ✅\n✅ ❌ Regulate AI chatbots\nBy Colin Lecher\nWHAT THE BILLS WOULD DO\nSenate Bill 243 by Democratic Sens. Josh Becker of Menlo Park and Steve Padilla of Chula Vista would require tech companies that create artificial intelligence chatbots, like ChatGPT, to clearly inform users that the bot is not human, and to create a protocol to help users experiencing suicidal ideation. The bill would also task companies with instituting “reasonable measures” to prevent minors from interacting with sexually explicit material while using the bots.\nAssembly Bill 1064 by San Ramon Democratic Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, the Leading Ethical AI Development (LEAD) for Kids Act, would outlaw the use of companion chatbots for children entirely unless the bot “is not foreseeably capable” of harming a child, such as by encouraging self-harm or drug use.\nWHO SUPPORTS THEM\nInitially, several tech watchdog and child safety groups, including the American Association of Pediatrics, supported SB 243. But many withdrew their support, saying last-minute changes hopelessly watered it down. Some moved their support to the broader AB 1064. Groups including Common Sense Media and Tech Oversight California are now supporting that legislation, while the Computer and Communications Industry Association trade group says SB 243 would at least not create “an overbroad ban on AI products” like AB 1064.\nWHO OPPOSES THEM\nThe CCIA initially testified against SB 243, arguing it was overly broad and would stifle innovation. It altered its position after the last-minute changes. On the other side of the debate, while groups like Common Sense Media supported earlier versions of SB 243, they have since dropped that support to back the other measure.\nWHY IT MATTERS\nThe bills come as lawmakers face immense pressure to rein in tech chatbots following several high-profile tragedies. News reports nationwide have shown how AI-powered chatbots have fed users’ delusions, sometimes leading to real-world violence.\nSome recent scandals have also drawn attention specifically to children’s relationships to chatbots. In August, the New York Times reported on the case of 16-year-old Adam Raine, who spoke to ChatGPT about suicide before ending his life. Watchdog groups have accused ChatGPT of giving other harmful information to teens as well. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, also faced criticism recently after leaked internal documents obtained by Reuters showed the company allowed its AI chatbots to have “romantic or sensual” conversations with children.\nGOVERNOR’S CALL ✅ ❌\n✅ Allow Uber and Lyft drivers to unionize\nWHAT THE BILL WOULD DO\nAssembly Bill 1340 by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, a Democrat from Oakland, would allow ride-hailing drivers to unionize. Uber and Lyft consider drivers independent contractors, and this bill would make California the second state in the nation to give drivers the right to bargain with the companies. On the Assembly floor right before the bill was approved, Wicks said gig workers lobbied elected officials “so that they can have a seat at the table to fight for paid leave, to fight for higher pay, to fight for safety and all the other things that they deserve.”\nWHO SUPPORTS IT\nThe Service Employees International Union sponsored the legislation, but at least one other drivers group and labor experts say that last-minute amendments made to the bill would make it tough for any other union but the SEIU to be chosen to represent drivers.\nGov. Gavin Newsom, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas in late August announced a deal tying the unionization legislation to SB 371, an industry-sponsored bill that would lower insurance coverage requirements for ride-hailing.\nWHO IS OPPOSED\nThe ride-hailing industry dropped its opposition after the deal tying it to their insurance legislation. But Uber called the deal a “compromise,” and Lyft has not explicitly supported the unionization bill.\nRideshare Drivers United, a Los Angeles-based drivers group that has organized drivers for years, supported the bill at first. But the group’s president, Nicole Moore, said she was “outraged” when she realized the amendments essentially guarantee her group wouldn’t qualify to represent drivers because of its lack of experience in negotiating bargaining agreements.\nRepublican lawmakers spoke against the bill as it made its way through the Legislature, saying it goes against the spirit of Proposition 22, an industry-backed ballot proposition that became law and enshrined app-based gig workers’ independent contractor status.\nWHY IT MATTERS\nIf the state’s about 800,000 ride-hailing drivers vote to form a union, it would give them the ability to bring longstanding complaints about wages, benefits, deactivations and other issues to the bargaining table. The bill also includes requirements for Uber and Lyft to disclose more information about drivers and rides, data that experts say would increase transparency around the ride-hailing industry.\nGOVERNOR’S CALL ✅\n✅ Stop ICE officers from wearing masks\nWHAT THE BILL WOULD DO\nSenate Bill 627, authored by Democratic Sens. Jesse Arreguín, Sasha Pérez, Aisha Wahab and Scott Wiener would widely prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing face masks while conducting their duties. The “No Secret Police Act” would apply to all federal and local law enforcement while operating in California. Officers who violate the law would face an infraction or misdemeanor. The legislation does not apply to certain types of face coverings, such as face shields, and exempts certain officers, such as those who are undercover. By July 2026, the bill would require all law enforcement agencies to publish a face covering policy.\nWHO SUPPORTS IT\nThe bill has more than two dozen Democratic co-authors and widespread support from nonprofit organizations, including the ACLU, Indivisible and Drug Policy Alliance. Its sponsor, the nonprofit organization Prosecutors Alliance Action, argues that the legislation would create more transparency and trust in law enforcement, and safeguard against bad actors impersonating the police. Without visible identification, the group contends that masked and anonymous federal agents create dangerous conditions for the public and law enforcement.\nWHO IS OPPOSED\nSenate Republicans and California law enforcement advocacy groups, including the California Police Chiefs Association, the California State Sheriffs Association and the California Association of Highway Patrolmen oppose the legislation. The powerful umbrella labor organization that lobbies on behalf of police unions, the Peace Officers Research Association of California, argues that the proposal is “misguided, unnecessary, and counterproductive” because California has no jurisdiction over federal agents and has already established accountability measures around officer identification.\nWHY IT MATTERS\nLaw enforcement officers, particularly federal agents, have concealed their identities during immigration raids across California and the country. Lawmakers argue that extreme masking sows fear, confusion and violence that harms public safety. The proposed law aims to put an end to the practice. “When law enforcement officers hide their identities, it destroys community trust,” said Weiner, of San Francisco, at a legislative hearing in August.\nGOVERNOR’S CALL ✅\n✅ Allow undocumented parents to name a guardian\nBy Jeanne Kuang\nWHAT THE BILL WOULD DO\nAssembly Bill 495, authored by Arleta Democratic Assemblymember Celeste Rodriguez, is intended to allow undocumented parents to establish a caregiver for their children if they’re detained by immigration agents or deported. It does that primarily with a long-existing form called the caregiver’s authorization affidavit, which allows an adult relative caring for a child who isn’t their parent, such as a sibling, grandparent or aunt or uncle, to temporarily make decisions such as enrollling the child in school or making medical decisions. The bill would allow a wider range of relatives to sign the form and serve as caregivers, including any adult “who is related to the child by blood, adoption, or affinity within the fifth-degree of kinship.” Parents could also designate a guardian for their children in family court.\nWHO SUPPORTS IT\nThe bill is backed by immigrants’ rights groups and children’s legal advocates who say families should be able to prepare in case parents are unavailable, such as in the case of a deportation. They argue immigrant families might not have many blood relatives nearby but often rely on extended family members and community networks who could step in if a parent is arrested, rather than having the child be put in foster care.\nWHO IS OPPOSED\nRepublican lawmakers and a group of religious and conservative activists fiercely opposed the legislation, arguing it could allow strangers and predators to declare they are caregivers using the easily accessible authorization form.\nWHY IT MATTERS\nIt’s one of several measures Democrats advanced this year in response to the immigration raids directed by the Trump administration that have roiled California communities. But because it deals with child protection issues, it also energized a deeply active portion of the religious right, who turned out to protest it at the Capitol and have in some cases made false claims that the legislation would allow strangers to take custody of children. Attacks from the right on such issues have often put Democrats in a defensive position. In 2023, activists successfully urged Gov. Gavin Newsom to veto a bill that requires family court judges to consider a parent’s support of children’s gender transition in custody disputes.\nGOVERNOR’S CALL ✅\n✅ ✅ Protect sensitive places from immigration sweeps\nWHAT THE BILLS WOULD DO\nCalifornia lawmakers passed several immigration bills this year responding to widespread immigration sweeps. Senate Bill 805 would require that officers identify themselves while conducting their duties and SB 81 would prohibit immigration enforcement from entering a health care facility without a judicial warrant or court order. Other bills, such as SB 98, aim to protect students from immigration enforcement on campus. That legislation comes on top of a bill to block law enforcement from wearing face masks and allow undocumented parents to designate a caregiver for their children if they’re detained.\nWHO SUPPORTS THEM\nDemocratic lawmakers this year supported a flurry of bills aimed to protect vulnerable communities from immigration enforcement and limit officers’ presence in sensitive places, such as hospitals and schools. The bills, shaped in response to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, were widely supported by nonprofit organizations, industry groups and immigrant rights advocates.\nWHO IS OPPOSED\nRepublican lawmakers opposed the bills, criticizing the Democratic efforts as an overreaction and voicing concern over the state’s role in federal actions such as immigration enforcement. California police organizations opposed the legislation, arguing that it is misdirected and puts their safety at risk. Opponents also questioned how the laws would be enforced, claiming that California does not have authority to challenge federal law enforcement mandates.\nWHY IT MATTERS\nCalifornia is home to more immigrants and more immigrants living in the country illegally than any other state. Democratic lawmakers argue that these policies are important to protect public safety as well as immigrants’ constitutional rights during what the Trump administration has promised will be the largest deportation campaign in U.S. history.\nGOVERNOR’S CALL ✅ ✅\n✅ Roll back the cannabis excise tax\nWHAT THE BILL WOULD DO\nCalifornia increased its excise tax on cannabis substantially in July, to 19% from 15%. AB 564 by Assemblymember Matt Haney, a San Francisco Democrat, would undo that increase and freeze the cannabis excise tax — a levy imposed by the state before sales taxes are applied — at 15% through the end of June 2028.\nWHO SUPPORTS IT\nThe weed industry has sounded the alarm for years about a failing legal system in California, beset by overproduction, resistant local governments, plummeting prices and high taxes. Growers, dispensary owners and consumer advocates rallied unsuccessfully this spring for a budget deal to avert the excise tax increase, which they argue could push price-sensitive customers back into the illicit market and deal a fatal blow to many businesses already operating with slim margins. Now they hope that Newsom, who previously pledged to sign a proposal halting the tax increase, will reverse it.\nWHO IS OPPOSED\nCannabis tax revenues pay for child care slots, environmental cleanup, substance abuse education and impaired driving prevention efforts. Increasing the excise tax is projected to yield about $180 million annually. Loath to lose that financial boost, especially as California faces a growing budget deficit, nonprofits that receive grants from the money have led the charge against AB 564. They accuse supporters of putting industry profits above children’s health and the environment.\nWHY IT MATTERS\nSince voters legalized recreational weed in 2016, California has struggled to bring its market out of the shadows. The state Department of Cannabis Control estimates that legal sales still comprise less than 40% of consumption in California, and tax revenue has declined recently. The industry blames state and local excise and sales taxes that can raise prices by a third. Cannabis companies contend that tax relief would help stabilize their business and grow legal sales — and, by extension, tax revenue — in the long run. But opponents point out that the industry made the exact same case three years ago, when Newsom and lawmakers cut a similar deal.\nGOVERNOR’S CALL ✅\n✅ Establish a state agency for reparations\nWHAT THE BILLS WOULD DO\nSan Diego Democratic Sen. Akilah Weber Pierson authored two key reparations bills in response to recommendations made by the Reparations Task Force. Senate Bill 518 would establish the Bureau for Descendants of American Slavery under California’s Civil Rights Department. The new state agency would create divisions including genealogy, property reclamation and education, to provide infrastructure for implementing reparative policies. The bill is a second shot at a previous attempt by former Democratic Sen. Steven Bradford to establish a new state agency. Her other legislation, SB 437, would allocate up to $6 million for the California State University system to develop a methodology for verifying descendants of enslaved people who wish to access benefits.\nWHO SUPPORTS THEM\nMembers of the task force support SB 518, along with nonprofit organizations including the Equal Justice Society, which argues the legislation is a step toward addressing the ongoing harms of descendents of U.S. chattel slavery. SB 437 is supported by the California Reparations Task Force and various nonprofits, including Equality California, which maintains that a genealogical verification process will ensure an equitable distribution of benefits. Weber Pierson said the bills will ensure nobody is excluded from the reparative justice process.\nWHO IS OPPOSED\nGroups that want to see California move more swiftly toward implementing recommendations from the Reparations Task Force oppose the legislation. The grassroots organization Lineage Equity Advancement Project argues that the legislation would delay the implementation of reparative policies and payout of benefits. The group also argued that lawmakers failed to incorporate any input from community voices who have long advocated for reparations and reparative justice. “California doesn’t need more research into whether it should act. It needs to act,” said Chris Lodgson, an advocate with the Coalition for a Just and Equitable California\nWHY IT MATTERS\nIn the wake of George Floyd’s murder, California established the nation’s first reparations task force to study and propose ways to provide reparative justice for Black descendents of enslaved people. The California Legislative Black Caucus last year introduced a 14-bill reparations package based on recommendations from the task force, but two key bills were quashed late in the legislative process, creating a wedge between reparations advocates and lawmakers. This year, the caucus returned with 16 “Road to Repair” priority bills, including SB 437 and SB 518.\nGOVERNOR’S CALL ✅\n✅ Let more police redact names in misconduct reports\nWHAT THE BILL WOULD DO\nAssembly Bill 1178, by Assemblymember Blanca Pacheco, a Downey Democrat, would make it harder for the public to access police misconduct records. Already, state law allows agencies to redact those records if disclosing them would put the officer in danger. Under this proposed law, when deciding whether to redact, judges must also consider if the officer is working undercover and should remain anonymous because of their duties.\nWHO SUPPORTS IT\nDistrict attorneys and law enforcement groups, such as the California Police Chiefs Association and the powerful California Peace Officers Association, argue the measure is necessary to protect undercover agents from being “needlessly” named in public records, which they say could threaten the officers’ safety.\nWHO IS OPPOSED\nTransparency advocates and good government groups such as the First Amendment Coalition and the American Civil Liberties Union in California, argue that carveouts in existing state law already shield the personal information of at-risk officers from disclosure. Opponents deem the measure unnecessary and argue that the legislation would allow agencies to withhold crucial information about an officer simply because of their role.\nWHY IT MATTERS\nThe bill would roll back public access to police misconduct records just years after California lawmakers expanded it. In 2018 and 2021, California adopted laws that required the disclosure of police records about use of force, sexual assault and other misconducts. Those laws enabled UC Berkeley and Stanford University to create an online searchable database of misconduct documents from nearly 700 law enforcement agencies statewide. While the bill does not restrict the release of those records, it would give judges more reasons to redact information about undercover officers from those records.\nGOVERNOR’S CALL ✅\n✅ Ban ultraprocessed food in schools\nWHAT THE BILL WOULD DO\nAssembly Bill 1264 by Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, a Democrat from Encino, would ban schools from serving harmful “ultraprocessed foods” to students. The measure would task the California Department of Public Health with identifying food or beverages to eliminate that contain high amounts of saturated fat, sodium and sugar. It also identifies for elimination additives like food coloring or flavor enhancers.\nThe measure focuses on ingredients where research shows they are associated with cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity and behavioral issues among other health harms. Schools would have to fully phase out these ingredients by July 2035.\nWHO SUPPORTS IT\nThe legislation garnered broad bipartisan support from state lawmakers, including co-author and Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher, a farmer from Chico, and the legislative progressive caucus. The measure passed the Senate unanimously and made it out of the Assembly with one vote against.\n“Democrats and Republicans are joining forces to prioritize the health and safety of our children,” Gabriel said in a statement.\nThe Environmental Working Group and Consumer Reports co-sponsored the measure, whose supporters also include a coalition of children’s health and medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Diabetes Association. These groups say that “ultraprocessed foods” are linked to serious health risks.\nWHO IS OPPOSED\nIndustry groups like the Consumer Brands Association, California Grocers Association and California Farm Bureau remain opposed, despite significant amendments made to address industry concerns over the definition and regulation of “ultraprocessed foods.” Some opponents have argued that the legislation was “well-intentioned but impractical.” They contend that the definition is still too broad and could result in harmless ingredients that have nutritional value from being unintentionally banned, including canned fruits or vegetables.\nAssemblymember Carl DeMaio, a Republican from San Diego, voted against the measure.\nWHY IT MATTERS\nCalifornia Republican support for nutrition regulations predates the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” campaign. This legislation builds upon prior laws passed by Gabriel that ban certain food dyes from school meals and specified additives from grocery store sales. Those bills, which have at times been derided by Republicans nationally as examples of government overreach, have generally enjoyed some bipartisan support from state lawmakers.\nThis story has been updated to correct the deadline for schools to comply. It is 2035, not 2032.\nGOVERNOR’S CALL ✅\n✅ Create an education antisemitism prevention coordinator\nWHAT THE BILL WOULD DO\nAssembly Bill 715 by Assemblymembers Rick Chavez Zbur and Dawn Addis, Democrats from Los Angeles and San Luis Obispo, respectively, would create a state Office for Civil Rights with an antisemitism prevention coordinator and create new processes to root out discriminatory learning materials in schools. The coordinator would develop and provide antisemitism education to teachers and school boards and also recommend other proposals to combat antisemitism.\nThe proposed law seeks to extinguish antisemitism in classrooms, though the definition of that concept has been the source of heated rhetoric that isn’t reconciled in the bill. A previous version defined antisemitism, including the “denigration” of believers of Zionism. Now the legislation’s focus on addressing antisemitism is limited to legislative declarations that have less legal teeth. Members of the public would be able to file anonymous complaints about alleged bias in school learning materials.\nWHO SUPPORTS IT\nThe bill was sponsored by a coalition of Jewish cultural, political and social outreach groups called Jewish Public Affairs Committee of California and was a priority for the California Legislative Jewish Caucus. No members in either chamber officially opposed it, though 14 lawmakers didn’t vote. The Simon Wiesenthal Center and Museums of Tolerance also backs the measure. “Jewish students across our state are being harassed, bullied, and intimidated simply because of who they are,” said Zbur at a legislative hearing in September. He noted instances of anti-semitic slurs and swastikas spray-painted on a Manhattan Beach school playground and San Francisco teachers being given “materials that justified Hamas’s October 7th attack.”\nWHO IS OPPOSED\nCollege student associations, faculty union groups, the main K-12 teachers unions and groups representing the interests of Arab and Muslim Californians and some progressive Jewish groups oppose it. California Teachers Association lobbyist Seth Bramble testified that it would codify into law “subjective standards for instruction under the term ‘factually accurate,’” and “would give advocates on multiple sides of controversial issues a new legal tool to disrupt instruction and to threaten educators.”\nWHY IT MATTERS\nThe rhetoric in schools following the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas and Israel’s subsequent military response has brought to a boil long-simmering frustrations about how to talk about Israel and Palestine. The bill’s earlier language defining antisemitism disturbed many progressives, who viewed it as simpatico with President Donald Trump’s efforts to liken anti-Zionism to antisemitism. Some coalitions of Jewish scholars say criticizing Israel is not inherently antisemitic, but many other Jews cite evidence of widespread Jewish intolerance in rhetoric and action.\nGOVERNOR’S CALL ✅\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

Paul even refused to shake Conway’s hand after a debate the two had at the University of Louisville on Oct. 17. During the debate, Paul called his opponent out multiple times saying, \"You just out and out lie because you have nothing to stand on. …You demean the state of Kentucky.\" Paul said: \"You know how we know when you’re lying? Your lips are moving.\"\nThis is the ad that caused the fuss:\nSo what are the facts? Is Conway \"lying\" or not?\nThe ad says that during his student days, Paul was a member of a secret society at Baylor University that \"called the Holy Bible a hoax\" and \"was banned for mocking Christianity and Christ.\" And it asks: \"Why did Rand Paul once tie a woman up, and tell her to bow down before a false idol and say his God was Aqua Buddha?\"\nThose allegations stem from a GQ story published in August. A former classmate of Paul’s at Baylor — speaking anonymously — told a reporter that 30 years ago Paul and a friend tied her hands, asked her to smoke marijuana and then took her to a creek where they blindfolded her and told her to worship an \"Aqua Buddha\" as her God. Several media outlets repeated the GQ story, calling Paul a kidnapper. But it now appears that the incident was just a weird prank, not a kidnapping, at least according to the woman involved. Still speaking anonymously, she told the Washington Post that she was merely being \"hazed\" by her friends.\nWashington Post, August 11: \"I went along because they were my friends,\" she said. \"There was an implicit degree of cooperation in the whole thing. I felt like I was being hazed.\" …\n\"[They] came over to my house as friends that I knew,\" she told me. \"They immediately said, `We’re going to tie you up and go for a ride.’ \" …\nThough the GQ piece never used the word \"kidnapping,\" (and quoted her saying the whole thing was a \"joke\"), subsequent media coverage has characterized the allegations this way, seemingly allowing Paul to keep the conversation focused on this one charge. He hasn’t responded to questions about the blindfolding or the Aqua Buddha.\nPaul doesn’t deny the incident. He does deny that he engaged in a criminal kidnapping, though the Conway ad doesn’t specifically accuse him of that.\nThere is support for the ad’s claim that Paul’s college group, the NoZe Brotherhood, \"mocked Christianity.\" According to Politico, for example, \"The group’s work often had a specifically anti-Christian tone, as it made fun of the Baptist college’s faith-based orientation.\" As for calling the Bible a \"hoax,\" that was done in a satirical article in the NoZe newsletter. The article, titled \"Fishy Bibles,\" claimed that the Bible’s true author was a Clement Updike, 83, of Victor, Calif., and quoted him as saying, \"I wrote it as a lark.\"\nPolitico also reports that the group was indeed formally banned at one point by Baylor on grounds of \"sacrilege.\" But that happened two years before Paul arrived. \"They had ‘made fun of not only the Baptist religion, but Christianity and Christ,’ \" Baylor President Herbert Reynolds told the student newspaper, The Lariat, according to Politico.\nSo the ad’s most dramatic claims are well documented. Whether it’s fair to dredge up irreverent college hijinks from 30 years ago is another matter, which we’ll leave to our readers to judge. Paul is out with a counter advertisement accusing Conway of \"attacking Rand Paul’s faith,\" and saying that \"Rand Paul keeps Christ in his heart.\"\nThe ad also claims that Paul wants to \"end all federal faith-based initiatives,\" created under President George W. Bush. That’s based on remarks that Paul made in June 2008 on the public affairs program \"Kentucky Tonight.\" Paul said Bush’s initiative was a \"horrible mistake\" and added: \"We shouldn’t have tax money flowing into churches, and we should let churches do charity work, and that’s wonderful, but they shouldn’t be corrupted with government money.\"\nThe Conway ad does contain a claim we find to be misleading. It claims that Paul wants to \"end the [tax] deduction for religious charities.\" That’s based on Paul’s supposed support for the FairTax proposal, which would replace the federal income tax with a broadly based sales tax on nearly all purchases — and thus eliminate the need for any deductions. And Paul’s campaign is now denying that he supports the FairTax anyway, according to The Associated Press.\nCorrection, Oct. 19: The original version of this story mistakenly said that Paul refused to shake Conway’s hand before an Oct. 17 debate, but that happened after the debate.\n— Joshua Goldman\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        %PDF-1.5 %���� 1 0 obj <>>> endobj 2 0 obj <> endobj 3 0 obj <>/ExtGState<>/XObject<>/ProcSet[/PDF/Text/ImageB/ImageC/ImageI] >>/MediaBox[ 0 0 595.32 841.92] /Contents 4 0 R/Group<>/Tabs/S/StructParents 0>> endobj 4 0 obj <> stream x��X�oGG��ǻH,�5�!E�bp\"��q1N�\n��y�y�Ά���ጇ�sV �Ȕ��6Y���Xu;g�n��A�c\\�d��fD@&�D����=�}���x���9�LzMO/I�\"���n�&��+L>u;���n�5Ȃ�W0[n���V�k<��9��9�1��\n�����(��F��E�a��B�Fd�: 5(�8}�2K��0�����[-��\\0�d�\n�lp\"/(.a2�I�ŚG�Oh�����.����b п}1\n��Q��Tz���\n��h�T���N�p�rn� ������a�b�|����Z�F�IBY����H�ӞT�� ���)YS�^c\n�|Z�ʠ�p�Z�GU\\��jr\n8tK5D�䈌�TJJD-���qtW�M� ��\\A�����S-�E�I���)~�w�*��X5}���A�����#�۳�)�E�&�J��=�d�����b2\n�Y���jM�y\\\n�Z/S��ă�]�^��;��c��8�a���pt�GN ���*��+:��R1�5���J]��F\"���O;kD��v?�\\>�3��8f��`o_������y�qô}]�Q�W�e%��c��)S�iB��^����nO(���\nu7�H/��^�*,ݺ�~o�Gu-�w�QGG�*u��#լ��h����˨����{e/ך\\��������$�Z9����=�\\Q�P��d@�1�G������_�b�'�o�sHG�9���\\n�=�=����b��\n�tG�P����G�����d��6��јU�(!�s�A�� Q�x�@FR۶��I����)��x}������gf%#�T\\��Y@_8���==�����������3j~�iMn��Hq�Lü$T���jI��]_��M�D��B�8^R�q�2����`����s5+)�M��f�~a�H�����v9=�+����<� |YO�1���p�����9����Ԡ��X#�s\n��>��iU�Uwx��L%�Tk�k��ձ������c���[U-'�Pϱ���I*Tr��h���\n���r>����c�ѩ�ρ�_���-���M^2�[%�?}��\nendstream\nendobj\n5 0 obj\n<>\nendobj\n6 0 obj\n<>\nendobj\n7 0 obj\n<>\nendobj\n8 0 obj\n<>\nendobj\n9 0 obj\n<>\nstream\nx���1jQ@QɊlY��M�)R�ąp�:�[��J��%��Md�Y@\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}

See below for a fact-check on each:\n- “These are the facts. Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration’s rollback of criminal enforcement.”\n- Fact: Over the past 25 years, crime in major cities has fallen 66 percent. In the country as a whole, violent crime is half of what it was in 1991, and has gone down 26 percent in the last decade. Property crime is down 43 percent in the past 25 years. No single-year change has reversed that trend. Instead, the murder rate for 2015 remains close to 2012 levels — just barely above recent, historic lows.\n- “Homicides last year increased by 17% in America’s fifty largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore. In the President’s hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone. And more than 3,600 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.”\n- Fact: There is no national murder wave. However select cities have seen increased murders. A recent Department of Justice study showed the murder rate in the nation’s 56 largest cities rose by 16.8 percent in 2015. But two-thirds of that increase occurred in just 10 cities. A Brennan Center study of the 30 largest cities showed the murder rate rose by 13.2 percent in 2015. But half of that change occurred in just three cities — Baltimore, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. Murder nationally is still similar to what it was in 2012, at historic lows.\n“Overall, crime rates remain at historic lows. Fear-inducing soundbites are counterproductive, and distract from nuanced, data-driven, and solution-oriented conversations on how to build a smarter criminal justice system in America,” said Ames Grawert, a counsel in the Brennan Center’s Justice Program. “It’s true that some cities saw an increase in murder rates last year, and that can’t be ignored, but it’s too early to say if that’s part of a national trend.”\nFor more information, see our recent report, Crime in 2015: A Final Analysis.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        Crime Trends in U.S. Cities:Year-End 2024 Update\nJanuary 2025\nErnesto Lopez\nSenior Research Specialist, Council on Criminal Justice\nBobby Boxerman\nGraduate Research Assistant, University of Missouri-St. Louis\nNote: A more up-to-date version of our crime trends report is now available.

It examines yearly and monthly rates of reported crime for 13 violent, property, and drug offenses in 40 American cities that have consistently reported monthly data over the past six years. The 40 cities are not necessarily representative of all jurisdictions in the United States. Not all cities published data for each offense (see the Appendix for which cities reported which offenses); trends in offenses with fewer reporting cities should be viewed with caution. Not all crimes are reported to law enforcement. In addition, the data collected for this report are subject to revision by local jurisdictions.\n- Reported levels of 12 of the 13 offenses covered in this report were lower in 2024 than in 2023; shoplifting was the only offense higher in 2024 compared to 2023.\n- Looking at changes in violent offenses from 2023 to 2024, the number of homicides in the 29 study cities providing data for that crime was 16% lower, representing 631 fewer homicides. There were 4% fewer reported aggravated assaults, 15% fewer gun assaults, 6% fewer sexual assaults, and 4% fewer domestic violence incidents last year than in 2023. Robbery fell by 10% while carjackings (a type of robbery) decreased by 32%.\nMotor vehicle theft had been on the rise from the summer of 2020 through 2023, but that trend reversed last year; there were 24% fewer motor vehicle thefts in 2024 than in 2023.\n- Reports of residential burglaries (-13%), nonresidential burglaries (-6%), larcenies (-5%), and drug offenses (-3%) all decreased in 2024 compared to 2023. But rates of reported shoplifting, a crime that has received extensive attention from the media and policymakers, increased by 14% over the same period.\nExamining trends over a longer timeframe, most violent crimes are at or below levels seen in 2019, the year prior to the onset of the COVID pandemic and racial justice protests of 2020. There were 6% fewer homicides in the study cities in 2024 than in 2019. Similarly, sexual assault (-26%), domestic violence (-11%), and robbery (-19%) were lower in 2024 than in 2019. In contrast, aggravated assaults (+4%), gun assaults (+5%), and carjackings (+25%) were higher in 2024 than in 2019.\nHomicide rates in some high-homicide cities, including Baltimore, Detroit, and St. Louis, have dropped even further, returning to the levels of 2014, when national homicide rates were at historic lows. Rates in other cities have largely returned to pre-pandemic levels.\n- Property crime trends have been mixed over the last five years. There were fewer residential burglaries (-38%) and larcenies (-12%) in 2024 than in 2019, but more nonresidential burglaries (+12%) and shoplifting (+1%). Motor vehicle thefts were higher by half (+53%) during the timeframe. Drug offenses in 2024 were 28% below 2019 levels.\n- While these crime reductions are promising, the United States still experiences high levels of homicide compared to other industrialized nations, and progress should not slow local, state, federal, and community efforts to adopt comprehensive, evidence-based strategies to reduce violence. Furthermore, researchers should redouble their efforts to identify how broad behavioral shifts and other societal dynamics may affect trends.\nFigure 1. Percent Change in Violent Offenses, 2019 – 2024\nFigure 2. Percent Change in Property Offenses, 2019 – 2024\nIntroduction\nThis report updates CCJ’s previous studies of crime changes in larger American cities that began during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, extending the analyses with data through December 2024. The 40 cities included in this study were selected based on the availability of data at the time of data collection in early January 2025 (see the Appendix for the full list). They range from Syracuse, NY, the smallest, with about 142,000 residents, to New York, the largest, with around 8.3 million residents. The mean population of the cities for which crime data were available is approximately 801,000, while the median population is roughly 500,000.\nThe report assesses changes between 2018 and 2024 for 13 crimes: homicide, aggravated assault, gun assault, sexual assault/rape, domestic violence, robbery, carjacking, residential burglary, nonresidential burglary, larceny, shoplifting, motor vehicle theft, and drug offenses. Trends in sexual assault are new to this report.1 As in previous reports, special attention is given to the trend in homicides. Long-term trends for many of these offenses are available here.\nCrime data for the report were obtained from online portals of city police departments that provided monthly incident-level data for the period between January 2018 and December 2024. Offense counts were converted to monthly crime rates per 100,000 city residents for analysis of monthly, half-year, and annual trends. Offense classifications varied somewhat across the cities, and not all cities reported data for each crime. The number of cities reporting crime data ranged from a high of 36 for larceny to a low of nine for carjacking. Trends in offenses with fewer reporting cities should be viewed with caution. (See the Appendix for a list of which offenses are included for which cities.)\nThe crime incident data for this report were obtained within days of the end of the study period to provide a timely snapshot of crime across the nation at the end of the year.2 As a result, these figures may-and often do-differ from data subsequently published by individual police departments. The findings also may differ from other counts released later by the FBI as part of its national crime reporting program, or findings published in reports by other nongovernmental organizations. In addition, the figures may differ from those in previous CCJ reports because they are based on a different number and mix of cities. Finally, CCJ excludes some offenses from its analysis if there is a significant difference between the incident data collected and other published numbers. As such, the data in this report should be viewed as preliminary. The city sample used for this report is not necessarily representative of every large American city or the nation as a whole. Finally, it is also important to recognize that many offenses are not reported to law enforcement.\nBetter Crime Data, Better Crime Policy\nTimely, accurate, complete, and usable crime trends data are critical to guiding efforts to control and prevent crime in the U.S. But despite recent improvements, national crime data still fall short of what are needed to sufficiently inform policy, practice, and political dialogue. At stake are billions in government spending on public safety and criminal justice, the viability of businesses and urban centers, and the extent to which Americans are safe, and feel safe, in their homes and communities.\nIn June 2024, the Council on Criminal Justice Crime Trends Working Group released a set of findings and recommendations to improve the country’s crime data infrastructure and reporting. The group’s proposals create a roadmap for action at the federal, state, and local levels to accelerate progress toward a national crime trends monitoring system that generates the timely, accurate, complete, and usable data critical to improving crime control and prevention strategies.\nChanges in Violent Offenses\nHomicide\nHomicide is the unlawful killing of one person by another. Figure 3 displays the average yearly and six-month homicide rates in the 29 cities for which homicide incident data were available at year-end 2024 (see Appendix). From 2018 to 2019 the average homicide rate increased by 10%, then increased another 26% from 2019 to 2020. The rate continued to increase into 2021 (+7%), dropped in 2022 (-7%), and continued to drop in 2023 (-11%). That downward trend continued in 2024. The average reported homicide rate last year was 16% lower than in 2023—representing 631 fewer homicides in the cities that reported data. Across the sample cities, the 2024 average homicide rate was about 6% lower than in 2019. Comparing the most recent six-month trends, the homicide rate during the first half of 2024 was 15% lower, on average, than during the same period in 2023, and 17% lower during the second half of the year.\nFigure 3. Homicide Rates in 29 Cities, 2018 – 2024\nFigure 4 shows the percentage change in homicide, by city, from 2023 to 2024 and from 2019 to 2024, along with the rate difference from 2019 to 2024. Twenty-two of the 29 cities experienced a homicide decrease from 2023 to 2024; Chandler, AZ, and Little Rock, AR, saw the largest decreases of 50% and 43%, respectively. Six of the sample cities experienced increases from 2023 to 2024, with Colorado Springs seeing the largest jump (+56%), followed by Charlotte, NC, (+13%). For the most up-to-date information on a specific city, please visit its website.\nFigure 4. Percent Change in Homicides in 29 Cities, 2019 – 2024\nThere is more variation in longer-term homicide trends than short-term trends. Compared to 2019 homicide rates, 16 of 29 study cities had higher homicide rates in 2024. As noted in CCJ’s prior crime trends report, the average sample decline in homicide from 2019 to 2024 appears to have been mainly driven by cities with traditionally high homicide levels. These include Baltimore (-40%) and St. Louis (-33%), which experienced the largest drops in homicide rates across the city sample. As an illustration, Chattanooga, TN, experienced a large 30% decline in homicide, falling from a rate of 19.1 homicides per 100,000 people in 2019 to a rate of 13.4 in 2024, corresponding to a 5.7 homicide rate drop. In contrast, St. Louis, had a percentage reduction in homicide rates (-33%) similar to Chattanooga’s, but went from a homicide rate of 72.1 in 2019 to a rate of 48.6 in 2024, a rate drop of 23.5 homicides per 100,000 people. In other words, the percentage change in homicide between St. Louis and Chattanooga is about the same, yet the homicide rate drop in St. Louis was about four times greater than in Chattanooga.\nWhile the large drops in murder for some of the highest homicide cities in the U.S. is a promising trend, it is possible that 2018 and 2019 were aberrations and thus may not be reliable years to use for comparisons. Given that, additional analysis for this report extends the comparative period back further. Figure 5 shows homicide trends for Baltimore, Detroit, St. Louis, Chicago, and New York from 2013 to 2024. Baltimore, Detroit, and St. Louis were selected because they traditionally have the highest homicide rates in the city sample and in the U.S. Chicago and New York are included because they are the two largest cities in the study sample and have had different homicide rates than the other cities in this figure. Since many large U.S. cities experienced a homicide increase in 2015, and homicide rates across the country were at historic lows in 2014, 2013 was selected as the starting year.\nAlthough Baltimore, Detroit, and St. Louis experienced different homicide patterns from 2013 to 2024, the 2024 rates in these three cities were at or below their homicide rates of 2013 and 2014. In 2024, Baltimore’s homicide rate of 35.2 per 100,000 people was between its 2013 rate (37.5) and 2014 rate (33.9). Detroit’s 2024 homicide rate (37.0) was the lowest the city experienced since 2013. The 2024 homicide rate in St. Louis (48.6) was slightly below the 2014 rate of 50.1. A look at the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report data shows that while the 2024 homicide rates for these three cities have returned to recent lows of 2013 and 2014, these rates were common in the 2000s for Detroit and St. Louis.3 For Baltimore, however, the 2014 rate was the second lowest homicide rate since 1989; 2011 had the lowest rate, 31.4.\nThe homicide trends are different in Chicago and New York. Although homicides in Chicago have declined since 2021, they are still above the 2013 to 2015 rates and the 2019 rate. While 2024 New York homicides are on par with 2013 rates (both were 3.8), the 2024 rate is still above the recent 2017 low (3.2) and the 2018 (3.6) and 2019 (3.6) rates.\nFigure 5. Homicide Trends in Five Cities, 2013 – 2024\nMultiple developments could explain the rise and subsequent fall of homicide rates, but identifying decisive factors with certainty is challenging, largely because much of the research published on crime during this period has described trends but has not directly measured or tested possible contributing factors. Nevertheless, pandemic-related changes in people’s daily activities and emotional and economic stress levels, changes in police practices, a rupture of public trust in law enforcement, and the suspension or reduction of social supports and programs are among the theories offered by crime scholars. For more information, please see this summary of possible explanations from members of CCJ’s Crime Trends Working Group.\nAggravated Assault\nAggravated assaults are assaults committed with a deadly weapon or those that result in or threaten serious bodily injury to the victim. Figure 6 displays the average yearly and six-month aggravated assault rates in the 24 cities for which data were available at year-end 2024 (see Appendix). From 2018 to 2019 the average aggravated assault rate increased by 3%, and then increased another 14% from 2019 to 2020. The rate continued to rise into 2021 (+2%), dropped in 2022 (-4%), and continued to drop in 2023 (-3%). The average reported aggravated assault rate in 2024 was 4% lower than in 2023. Across the sample cities, the 2024 average aggravated assault rate was about 4% higher than in 2019. Comparing the most recent six-month trends, the aggravated assault rate during the first half of 2024 was 2% lower, on average, than during the same period in 2023 and 2% lower during the second half.\nFor a more detailed look at trends in aggravated assault and other assaults, please see CCJ’s fact sheet.\nFigure 6. Aggravated Assault Rates in 24 Cities, 2018 – 2024\nGun Assault\nGun assaults are aggravated assaults committed with a firearm. Figure 7 displays the average yearly and six-month gun assault rates in the 10 cities for which data were available at year-end 2024 (see Appendix). From 2018 to 2019 the average gun assault rate increased by 7%, and then increased another 38% from 2019 to 2020. The rate continued to rise into 2021 (+9%), dropped in 2022 (-10%), and continued to decline in 2023 (-8%). The average reported gun assault rate in 2024 was 15% lower than in 2023. Across the sample cities, the 2024 gun assault rate was about 5% higher than in 2019. Comparing the most recent six-month trends, the gun assault rate during the first half of 2024 was 10% lower, on average, than during the same period in 2023 and 11% lower during the second half.\nFor a more detailed look at trends in gun assault and other assaults, please see CCJ’s fact sheet.\nFigure 7. Gun Assault Rates in 10 Cities, 2018 – 2024\nSexual Assault\nIn this report, the term sexual assault refers to aggregated counts and rates of the following offenses: forcible rape, statutory rape, and other forms of sexual assault. Cities included in the CCJ sample may have kept these individual offenses separate, combined them, or did not include all three offenses in its data. Figure 8 displays the average yearly and six-month sexual assault rates in the 27 cities for which data were available at year-end 2024 (see Appendix). From 2018 to 2019 the average sexual assault rate decreased by 4%, then fell another 19% from 2019 to 2020. The rate increased in 2021 (+12%), dropped in 2022 (-12%), and declined just slightly in 2023 (0.04%). The average reported sexual assault rate in 2024 was 6% lower than in 2023. Across the sample cities, the 2024 sexual assault rate was about 26% lower than in 2019. Comparing the most recent six-month trends, the sexual assault rate during the first half of 2024 was 4% lower, on average, than during the same period in 2023, and 0.4% lower during the second half.\nFor a more detailed look at trends in sexual assault and other assaults, please see CCJ’s fact sheet.\nFigure 8. Sexual Assault Rates in 27 Cities, 2018 – 2024\nDomestic Violence\nDomestic violence consists primarily of aggravated and so-called simple assaults committed against domestic partners or family members. Figure 9 displays the average yearly and six-month domestic assault rates in the 10 cities for which data were available at year-end 2024 (see Appendix). From 2018 to 2019 the average domestic assault rate decreased by 12%, then dropped another 1% from 2019 to 2020. The rate continued to decrease into 2021 (-3%), fell further in 2022 (-4%), and slightly increased in 2023 (+1%). The average reported domestic assault rate in 2024 was 4% lower than in 2023. Across the sample cities, the 2024 domestic assault rate was about 11% lower than in 2019. Comparing the most recent six-month trends, the domestic assault rate during the first half of 2024 was 1% higher, on average, than during the same period in 2023, and 3% lower during the second half.\nFigure 9. Domestic Assault Rates in 10 Cities, 2018 – 2024\nPlease see CCJ’s report on improving aggravated domestic violence estimates at the local level. For a more detailed look at trends in domestic and other assaults, please see CCJ’s fact sheet. Additional information can be found in CCJ’s systematic review of domestic violence during the initial period of the pandemic and related lockdowns.\nRobbery\nRobberies are thefts committed with force or the threat of force. Figure 10 displays the average yearly and six-month robbery rates in the 34 cities for which data were available at year-end 2024 (see Appendix). From 2018 to 2019 the average robbery rate decreased by 4%, then dropped another 8% from 2019 to 2020. The rate continued to decline into 2021 (-2%), then stayed about the same in 2022 (+1%) and in 2023 (+0.01%). The average reported robbery rate in 2024 was 10% lower than in 2023. Across the sample cities, the 2024 robbery rate was about 19% lower than in 2019. Comparing the most recent six-month trends, the robbery rate during the first half of 2024 was 5% lower, on average, than during the same period in 2023, and 16% lower during the second half.\nFor a more detailed look at robbery trends, please see CCJ’s fact sheet on the offense.\nFigure 10. Robbery Rates in 34 Cities, 2018 – 2024\nCarjacking\nCarjacking is theft or attempted theft of a motor vehicle by force or threat. Figure 11 displays the average yearly and six-month carjacking rates in the nine cities for which data were available at year-end 2024 (see Appendix). From 2018 to 2019 the average carjacking rate showed no change, and then jumped up 30% from 2019 to 2020. The rate continued to increase into 2021 (+22%), then rose again in 2022 (+12%) and 2023 (+3%). The average reported carjacking rate in 2024 was 32% lower than in 2023. Across the sample cities, the 2024 carjacking rate was about 25% higher than in 2019. Comparing the most recent six-month trends, the carjacking rate during the first half of 2024 was 26% lower, on average, than during the same period in 2023, and 34% lower during the second half. While reported carjackings are still elevated, this offense, though alarming and the subject of considerable media attention, is relatively uncommon (2,517 incidents in nine study cities in 2024) and comprises less than 10% of total robberies.\nFor a more detailed look at carjacking trends, including offense characteristics, please see CCJ’s report on carjacking.\nFigure 11. Carjacking Rates in 9 Cities, 2018 – 2024\nChanges in Property and Drug Offenses\nResidential Burglary\nBurglaries involve breaking and entering a residential or commercial premise for the purpose of committing a crime. Figure 12 displays the average yearly and six-month residential burglary rates in the 19 cities for which data were available at year-end 2024 (see Appendix). From 2018 to 2019 the average residential burglary rate decreased by 10%, then dropped another 16% from 2019 to 2020. The rate continued to fall into 2021 (-6%), then decreased again in 2022 (-5%) and in 2023 (-4%). The average reported residential burglary rate in 2024 was 13% lower than in 2023. Across the sample cities, the 2024 residential burglary rate was about 38% lower than in 2019. Comparing the most recent six-month trends, the residential burglary rate during the first half of 2024 was 10% lower, on average, than during the same period in 2023, and 12% lower during the second half.\nFor a more detailed look at burglary trends, please see CCJ’s fact sheet on the offense.\nFigure 12. Residential Burglary Rates in 19 Cities, 2018 – 2024\nNonresidential Burglary\nFigure 13 displays the average yearly and six-month nonresidential burglary rates in the 19 cities for which data were available at year-end 2024 (see Appendix). From 2018 to 2019 the average nonresidential burglary rate decreased by 1%, and then increased 36% from 2019 to 2020. The large increase in non-residential burglaries coincided with the widespread protests that followed the murder of George Floyd by police in May 2020 (see Figure A1). The rate decreased in 2021 (-14%), then increased in 2022 (+5%) and fell in 2023 (-2%). The average reported nonresidential burglary rate in 2024 was 6% lower than in 2023. Across the sample cities, the 2024 nonresidential burglary rate was about 12% higher than in 2019. Comparing the most recent six-month trends, the nonresidential burglary rate during the first half of 2024 was 9% lower, on average, than during the same period in 2023, and 1% higher during the second half.\nFor a more detailed look at burglary trends, please see CCJ’s fact sheet on the offense.\nFigure 13. Nonresidential Burglary Rates in 19 Cities, 2018 – 2024\nLarceny\nLarcenies are thefts unaccompanied by force or breaking and entering. Shoplifting and thefts of property from motor vehicles are the two most common forms of larceny. Figure 14 displays the average yearly and six-month larceny rates in the 36 cities for which data were available at year-end 2024 (see Appendix). From 2018 to 2019 the average larceny rate stayed flat, and then dropped 11% from 2019 to 2020. The rate increased in 2021 (+2%) and 2022 (+7%), and then fell in 2023 (-4%). The average reported larceny rate in 2024 was 5% lower than in 2023. Across the sample cities, the 2024 larceny rate was about 12% lower than in 2019. Comparing the most recent six-month trends, the larceny rate during the first half of 2024 was 5% lower, on average, than during the same period in 2023, and 5% lower during the second half.\nFor a more detailed look at larceny trends, please see CCJ’s fact sheet on the offense.\nFigure 14. Larceny Rates in 36 Cities, 2018 – 2024\nShoplifting\nShoplifting is a theft by someone other than an employee of the victim of an item displayed for sale. Figure 15 displays the average yearly and six-month shoplifting rates in the 25 cities for which data were available at year-end 2024 (see Appendix). From 2018 to 2019 the average shoplifting rate increased by 3%, and then dropped 19% from 2019 to 2020. The rate continued to decrease in 2021 (-13%), then increased in 2022 (+8%) and in 2023 (+15%). The average reported shoplifting rate in 2024 was 14% higher than in 2023. Across the sample cities, the 2024 shoplifting rate was about 1% higher than in 2019. Comparing the most recent six-month trends, the shoplifting rate during the first half of 2024 was 23% higher, on average, than during the same period in 2023 and 12% higher during the second half. Because these data rely on incidents reported to police, and because reporting practices vary across the retail industry, they almost certainly undercount total shoplifting by significant quantities.4\nFigure 15. Shoplifting Rates in 25 Cities, 2018 – 2024\nShoplifting and retail theft have received widespread attention from the retail industry, policymakers, and the media in the last three years. A CCJ analysis found that the median value of stolen goods per incident increased from 2019 to 2021 and that the overwhelming majority of reported shoplifting incidents involved one or two people, rather than the large groups seen in videos of “smash-and-grab” incidents that go viral on social media.\nIn addition, while the number of assaults that occurred in a store increased from the first half of 2019 to the first half of 2023, the share of shoplifting incidents that involve an assault is small, accounting for about 1% of total incidents.\nCCJ also took a closer look at shoplifting patterns in Chicago and Los Angeles neighborhoods. For a more detailed look at larceny and shoplifting trends, please see CCJ’s fact sheet on the offense.\nMotor Vehicle Theft\nFigure 16 displays the average yearly and six-month motor vehicle theft in the 34 cities for which data were available at year-end 2024 (see Appendix). From 2018 to 2019 the average motor vehicle theft rate increased by 2%, then rose another 15% from 2019 to 2020. The rates continued to climb in 2021 (+12%), 2022 (+25%), and 2023 (+25%). That trend reversed in 2024. The average reported motor vehicle theft rate in 2024 was 24% lower than in 2023. Still, across the sample cities, the 2024 motor vehicle theft rate was about 53% higher than in 2019. Comparing the most recent six-month trends, the motor vehicle theft rate during the first half of 2024 was 16% lower, on average, than during the same period in 2023, and 29% lower during the second half. Figure 17 shows the percentage change in motor vehicle theft, by city, from 2023 to 2024, 2019 to 2024, and the rate difference from 2019 to 2024.\nFigure 16. Vehicle Theft Rates in 34 Cities, 2018 – 2024\nFigure 17 shows the percentage change in motor vehicle theft, by city, from 2023 to 2024 and from 2019 to 2024, as well as the rate difference from 2019 to 2024. In 2024, 28 of the 34 cities in the sample experienced a decrease compared to 2023. Looking back further, while many cities have seen recent declines in motor vehicle theft, only five in the sample had lower rates in 2024 than in 2019. In 10 of the sample cities, motor vehicle theft was twice as high (an increase of more than 100%) in 2024 as in 2019.\nFigure 17. Percentage Change in Motor Vehicle Theft Rates in 34 Cities, 2019 – 2024\nThe increase in motor vehicle theft over recent years reversed a decades-long decline. Motor vehicle theft peaked in 1991 at a rate of 659 per 100,000 people. By 2019, that rate had dropped 67% to 221 per 100,000 people–nearly identical to the rate in 1963. By 2023, however, the most recent year for which full national data are available, the motor vehicle theft rate had climbed to 319, the highest rate since 2007 (368 per 100,000). In addition to its direct impacts on victims, motor vehicle theft merits concern because stolen vehicles are often used to commit other crimes, including robberies, burglaries, and drive-by shootings. Please see the Council’s fact sheet on motor vehicle theft for a more detailed look.\nDrug Offenses\nDrug offenses include arrests for the manufacture, sale, or possession of illicit drugs. Figure 18 displays the average yearly and six-month drug offense rates in the 24 cities for which data were available at year-end 2024 (see Appendix). From 2018 to 2019 drug offense rates decreased by 11%, then dropped another 27% from 2019 to 2020. The rate declined in 2021 (-4%), then increased in 2022 (+1) and 2023 (+3%). The average reported drug offense rate in 2024 was 3% lower than in 2023. Across the sample cities, the 2024 drug offense rate was about 28% lower than in 2019. Comparing the most recent six-month trends, the drug offense rate during the first half of 2024 was 3% higher, on average, than during the same period in 2023, and 1% lower during the second half.\nFigure 18. Drug Offense Rates in 24 Cities, 2018 – 2024\nSummary and Conclusion\nThis study is the fourteenth in a series of reports for CCJ exploring crime patterns since the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic and establishment of the Council’s National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice. Updating the earlier analyses, this study reveals a mix of increases and decreases in crime rates across a sample of U.S. cities through December 2024.\nOverall, the findings suggest that most offenses in the sample cities are near or below 2019 levels. Homicide, the most serious of the crimes, has fallen to 6% below 2019 rates across the sample, though many cities are still experiencing high rates of murder. This study shows that the homicide drop has been driven partly by cities with traditionally high homicide rates experiencing large declines and returning to levels not seen in about a decade. This trend is promising but should be viewed as preliminary, given that it is based on a sample of cities because national-level data are not yet available. Moreover, if the national homicide rate were to fall back to pre-pandemic, 2019 levels, that rate (5.2 per 100,000 U.S. residents) was 15% higher than the 2014 rate (4.5 per 100,000), which was the lowest since World War II.5 While a 5.2 per 100,000 homicide rate is roughly half the modern peak of 9.8 recorded in 1991, this progress is of little comfort to families who lose loved ones to violence. Even with homicide dropping to levels more typical for the U.S., the nation and its individual states still have rates that are high compared to other industrialized nations.\nAs we welcome the decline of most crime types to 2019 levels, it’s important to recognize that such progress was far from guaranteed. As noted in a prior Council report, the homicide rate was 32.5% higher in the first two months of 2020 compared to 2019, before COVID-19 restrictions and summer protests. Additionally, a recent study of gun fatalities using national public health data identified an upward shift that began in October 2019.6 While there has been variation in city trends over time, there has also been variation in individual-level victimization. Black youth (ages 15 to 24) experienced substantial increases in fatal firearm victimization during the pandemic,7 and Black Americans continued to experience non-fatal violent victimization through 2023, when White and Hispanic victimization was falling.\nWhile reported rates of some crimes, such as carjacking and motor vehicle theft, have dropped significantly in the past year, they remain above 2019 levels. Reported incidents of shoplifting, a crime that has received enormous attention in state capitols, Congress, and the media, dropped abruptly early in the pandemic as stores closed during COVID lockdowns, but have now increased back to 2019 levels. By contrast, sexual assault, robbery, residential burglary, and drug offenses in 2024 were at least 19% below 2019 levels.\nThe return to pre-pandemic levels seen for many offenses should not slow our nation’s efforts to reduce crime. Many communities continue to suffer from disturbingly high rates of violence, and evidence-based crime reduction strategies are still urgently needed. This is also a time when investment is warranted to help us better understand the changing crime landscape and craft effective crime control approaches for the present and the future. The Council’s Crime Trends Working Group identified key gaps in criminal justice data, including non-fatal gun violence, white-collar, environmental, and cybercrimes, and produced a set of actionable recommendations for policymakers to close those gaps.\nAlong with improvements in crime data, continuing research on crime trends is essential to accelerate progress and bring crime down to all-time lows. While the study of historical crime trends remains important, society has experienced large shifts in new directions, especially becoming increasingly digital, since the crime drop of the late 1990s.8 Analyzing these and other changes can help us better understand the dynamics driving today’s crime patterns and identify the policies and practices most likely to make our communities safer. For instance, there is a general concern that the increased use of social media by youth has contributed to an increase in youth violence.9 Nevertheless, aggregate trends suggest that overall juvenile crime is down, and some of the decline may have been driven by reduced substance use and decreased informal socialization by juveniles (e.g., going to parties).\nCrucially, understanding recent crime trends is not a purely academic exercise. Beyond crime’s direct consequences for victims and survivors, its societal costs are immense, reminding us that even during periods of declining crime, efforts to reduce harm must remain a priority.\nOffense Dashboard\nPercent Change in Crime from 2018 and Annual Rates, 2019 – 2024\nMonthly Crime Trends by Type and City, January 2018 – December 2024\nAppendix\nFigure A1.

America’s housing affordability crisis is caused by deeply rooted challenges:\n- not enough deeply affordable housing development and preservation;\n- inadequate rental assistance programs, persistently low incomes, and weak safety nets like social security that help people pay for housing;\n- the end of federal COVID-19 relief funds, which temporarily expanded assistance programs and household incomes; and\n- discriminatory policies and practices that make it even harder for certain groups to find housing.\nThe lack of deeply affordable housing is the primary cause of homelessness. For many, rising costs create an impossible choice between paying for housing and other necessities like healthcare, groceries, or clothing.\nOnly 35 affordable and available rental homes exist for every 100 extremely low-income renter households. Year after year, this number stays the same or shifts incrementally as the development and preservation of affordable housing does not keep up with demand. Meanwhile, elected officials have failed to fix the problem, especially by allocating too few resources to programs that help people pay for increasingly expensive rents.\nFailing Systems Push Affordable Housing Further Out of Reach\nIn this context, people across the country, from every demographic group and geography, are unable to find housing. But discriminatory policies, stigma, and a lack of coordinated support services make it even harder for specific groups. People of color; gender-expansive peopleGender Expansive\nPeople whose identity differs from their birth sex and/or who don’t solely identify as male or female. HUD asks people experiencing homelessness to select their gender identity, but the categories have changed over time.; and people who are in the immigration system, the child welfare system, the criminal-legal system, and the healthcare system face different but significant barriers to finding stable housing. For example, people who have a criminal record often experience discrimination when applying for a lease or a job. In a scarce affordable housing markets with minimal social safety nets, any policies and practices that create additional obstacles can push people into homelessness.\nIn 2023 and 2024, the already-stretched homeless response system was also responding to a new development. Large numbers of new arrivals, including many children, entered the United States, seeking economic opportunity and often fleeing persecution and unsafe conditions in their home countries. Underfunded housing and resettlement programs — together with policies that prevent asylum seekers from being able to work for nearly a year — forced many to turn to local homeless service providers for assistance. As a result, homeless services systems became a part of a political storm that too often pits vulnerable groups against one another. However, experts on homelessness have long known that America has the resources and know-how to end homelessness for all people, including recent arrivals.\nThese barriers to housing are reflected in the data. According to the 2024 PIT CountPoint-in-Time (PIT) Count\nHUD’s annual census of people experiencing homelessness — both sheltered and unsheltered — on a single night in January., the following was true about homelessness in America:\n- More people in the United States were experiencing homelessness compared with any year since 2007 (when data collection began) — a total of 771,480 people.\n- Overall homelessness increased by 18 percent since the previous year (2023).\n- More people (118,376) did not have a home in 2024 than in 2023.\n- The overwhelming majority (82 percent) of Continuums of Care (CoCs)Continuum of Care (CoC)\nThe planning bodies that coordinate housing and supportive services to families and individuals experiencing homelessness in a particular locality, region, or geographic area. experienced increases in homelessness. - First-time homelessness has also been on the rise (increasing 23 percent since 2019)1. Federal and state resources for people experiencing homelessness are not keeping up with demand in most communities.\nIt is imperative to focus the most attention on the central issues that drive the homelessness crisis: housing costs and low incomes. Research demonstrates the relationship between high housing costs and homelessness. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, when a CoC’s median rent increased $100, homelessness rose by 9 percent. From 2001–2023, median rents increased 23 percent (after adjusting for inflation) while renters’ median incomes rose just 5 percent.\nRising housing costs and low incomes are causing more people to experience homelessness for the first time2. While the PIT Count captures data from a point in time, the most recent data collected over the course of a year — in 2022 — indicated that approximately 682,612 people experiencing homelessness and seeking shelter did so for the first time. Without solutions to address the housing affordability crisis, it is likely that more people will continue to experience housing insecurity and flow into homelessness systems.\nMillions of People Are on the Brink of Homelessness\nIf a household cannot find housing or afford to pay for it, they would be described as housing insecure and at risk of experiencing homelessness. Rising housing insecurity is reflected in the number of households spending 50 percent or more of their income on housing costs (referred to as severely housing cost-burdened households) and the number of people who live in overcrowded homes with friends, family, or acquaintances due to financial reasons (referred to as doubled up individuals). These indicators point to an underlying problem: people face systemic barriers to finding a stable home.\nSevere housing cost burden is common.\nTwo out of three extremely low-income renter households live in poverty and are severely housing cost-burdened Housing Cost Burdened\nCost-burdened households spend 30 percent or more of income on housing; severely cost-burdened spend 50 percent or more. (over 7.2 million households).\nSevere housing cost burden is increasing.\nFrom 2022 to 2023, the number of severely housing cost-burdened households increased in more than half of states.\nCost burdens do not impact all groups equally.\nBlack and Native American communities consistently face the most significant challenges.\nCurrent and historic discrimination in federal housing programs, employment, education, and the economy have made it more difficult for all groups of color to rent or own housing. Large increases in rental costs impact these groups more.\nMany people live doubled up out of financial necessity.\nIn addition to those who are cost-burdened, nearly 3.2 million people live doubled upDoubled Up\nA person who is living in overcrowded housing out of financial necessity.. This is another indicator that a person may be at risk of literal homelessness (i.e., living in shelters or in unsheltered locations).\nNearly half of survey participants in the recent California Statewide Study of People Experiencing Homelessness reported living in doubled up situations before experiencing homelessness. Some contributed to the rent, while others did not; but all doubled up arrangements were temporary and lacked the legal protections that being a leaseholder could provide.\nThe number of people living doubled up is increasing in some places.\nIn 21 states (including Texas, Florida, Illinois, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia), the number of people living doubled up increased from 2022 to 2023. It is not always ideal to move in with friends or family: multiple people may be crammed into small spaces, live with an abusive host, or be put at risk of eviction if additional residents violate a host’s lease. While some households may prefer to live together, the Alliance’s methodology to calculate doubled up homelessness only counts those people who are likely doubling up due to financial necessity.\nHow do Systems and Communities Respond to Homelessness?\nNationally, systems and communities are responding to increases in homelessness by expanding their numbers of shelter beds, permanent housingPermanent Housing\nHUD defines permanent housing as community-based housing with no set time limit, where participants hold a lease of at least one year, renewable monthly, and terminable only for cause. units, and services. However, it is not nearly enough to keep up with demand. In 2024, no state had enough permanent housing for everyone experiencing homelessness.\nRather than addressing those needs, some elected officials are fining, jailing, and punishing people experiencing homelessness. This wastes taxpayer dollars, and it makes it harder for providers to help people exit homelessness.\nThe U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) data for 2024 indicate:\nWhile there have been reductions in their capacity to shelter and house people, workers and leaders in the homelessness response system are serving more people than ever before. On the night of the annual PIT CountPoint-in-Time (PIT) Count\nHUD’s annual census of people experiencing homelessness — both sheltered and unsheltered — on a single night in January., more than 1.1 million people relied on the response system for shelter or permanent housing.3\nWhile the total number of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness increased, a greater share of people experiencing homelessness are sheltered. This indicates that when response workers are given more resources, they use them to serve more people in need.\nStill, given shortages in affordable housing, many of these workers are overcoming tremendous challenges when they try to move people from sheltered or unsheltered homelessness into permanent housing.\nCurrent Policy Shifts May Exacerbate Challenges, Especially for Vulnerable Groups\nAs described above, an ongoing affordable housing crisis and other factors are causing millions of Americans to be homeless or on the brink of homelessness, and homeless services systems are under-resourced to serve everyone in need. It is within this context that the federal policy world has begun a noticeable shift. In 2025, the Executive and Legislative branches took steps to dramatically reduce the size of the federal government, including reducing investments in housing and other anti-poverty programs. Furthermore, the President has urged other shifts in homelessness policy, including ending the federal CoCContinuum of Care (CoC)\nThe planning bodies that coordinate housing and supportive services to families and individuals experiencing homelessness in a particular locality, region, or geographic area. program and upending proven solutions to homelessness in favor of approaches that do not work. The dangers are apparent:\n- An estimated 218,000 people (often older adults, people with disabilities, and people with health challenges) relied on the federal CoC program for housing and services through Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH)Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH)\nPermanent housing with housing assistance and supportive services to help households with a disabled member maintain housing stability. in 2024. - More than 9 million people who struggle to afford market-rate housing rely on federal rental assistance.\n- Rural and suburban communities, including in many southern and midwestern states, disproportionately rely on federal government resources to provide housing.\nThe current policy environment could cause untold numbers of housed low-income people to lose their housing. Cutting resources for proven solutions while increasing resources toward punitive approaches (like jailing people experiencing homelessness) will make it especially difficult for people who use substances and people with severe mental illness to stay housed and connect with the care they need. Not all areas of the country would be impacted equally, but states on both sides of the political aisle could be devastated. The goal of ending homelessness may become further out of reach.\nWho Does Homelessness Impact?\nWithout enough affordable housing units, income support, and emergency response resources to reach everyone in need, one medical bill, job loss, or natural disaster can cause someone to experience homelessness. However, certain groups are more likely to face challenges accessing the resources they need to stay housed. Once homeless, many of these same groups also face challenges accessing emergency resources. This section describes these important demographic trends among people experiencing homelessness.\nMany of the demographic trends outlined in this section were also impacted by changes in immigration. The United States is a nation of immigrants, with immigration rates fluctuating over time. At the time 2024 data were published, these numbers temporarily increased as more new residents were fleeing violence, persecution, economic displacement, and climate disaster to seek refuge in the United States.\nHowever, research indicates that the United States’ approach to engaging with new arrivals is inadequate. Policies and regulations in the United States cause asylum seekers to face unique challenges accessing housing. These may include policies that exclude them from the workforce; obstacles acquiring the documentation that is necessary to access housing, nutrition or health support; and language barriers. They may also face discrimination from landlords and not fully understand their rights. In some instances, asylum seekers were also intentionally sent to communities where they did not know people, making it impossible for them to rely on family or friends for support. Without robust social networks to fall back on, the homeless response system may be their only option. To meet the growing need for affordable housing and homeless services across all communities, the response system needs more resources.\nStark racial and ethnic disparities in homelessness: people of color are overrepresented.\nHomelessness disproportionately impacts people of color. It is a racial justice issue. Historical and contemporary discrimination and exclusion from housing, education, employment, and wealth-building, and discriminatory practices in the criminal-legal system make it harder for Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) to access financial resources and safe, stable housing. Twentieth-century policies like redlining and legally sanctioned segregation systematically excluded people from buying homes that could be passed down to their children, as well as other housing opportunities. This continues to have negative impacts today. For example, as noted below, people of color are still less likely to be homeowners than White people.\nMany groups of color are more likely than the overall population to be severely rent-burdened, paying more than half of their incomes on rent. Renters of color, and especially Black renters, experience higher eviction rates than White renters. Research from the Eviction Lab and the U.S. Census Bureau show that more than half of all eviction filings are against Black renters despite the group representing only 18 percent of renters.\nAdditionally, the nation’s social safety net does not distribute resources in ways that meaningfully address the impacts of systemic and individual discrimination and exclusion. This is reflected in high, and growing, rates of overall homelessness and unsheltered homelessnessUnsheltered Homelessness\nHUD defines “unsheltered” as sleeping in places not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation — such as tents, train stations, sheds, or garages unfit for habitation. among Black and Indigenous people in particular. Although it is illegal to exclude a person from housing based on their race, data indicate that people of color face more harassment and discrimination when searching for a place to live. To ensure that everyone has an opportunity to access safe, stable housing, organizations and local officials need funding to enforce existing protections against discrimination. Communities of color also need targeted housing and economic support to address the impacts of systemic and deliberate efforts to withhold resources from them.\nMost subgroups experienced large increases in homelessness in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic, but because of the reasons outlined above, Hispanic/Latino, Asian American, Black and Native communities experienced the largest increases. Groups already more likely to be severely housing cost-burdened Housing Cost Burdened\nCost-burdened households spend 30 percent or more of income on housing; severely cost-burdened spend 50 percent or more. were impacted by rising rents and a slower jobs recovery rate. It is also likely that more Latino, Black, and Asian new arrivals are experiencing homelessness as a result of antiquated and failing immigration systems. These factors exacerbate existing inequities among these racial groups. Increasing resources for the homeless response system to better address these disparities would help build local economies and create more abundant communities for everyone.\nOnce homeless, some racial groups face greater challenges accessing emergency resources. This leads to higher rates of unsheltered homelessness. Even as unsheltered homelessness decreased between the 2023 and 2024 PIT CountsPoint-in-Time (PIT) Count\nHUD’s annual census of people experiencing homelessness — both sheltered and unsheltered — on a single night in January., multi-racial and Indigenous people remained most likely to experience unsheltered homelessness.\nThese trends are important. It is also important to acknowledge that trends within these groups are less visible because government agencies tend to use broad race categories. For example, there are big differences in rates of housing insecurity within the umbrella term “Asian American.” Additionally, HUD added the category “Middle Eastern or North African” to the PIT Count for the first time in 2024. This may have impacted trends in other categories.\nFrom 2023 to 2024, families with children experienced the largest year-over-year increase in homelessness of any group.\nDuring the decade leading up to 2023, many communities were driving large decreases in homelessness among families because policymakers and practitioners often prioritize them for resources. These reductions quickened during the COVID-19 pandemic as investments in child care, healthcare, nutrition, and income programs for families with children grew. This created more economic stability for low-income families and lowered childhood poverty rates significantly. However, the end of increased investments tied to COVID-19 relief, coupled with a demand for affordable housing that greatly exceeds existing supply, is contributing to reversals of this progress.\nIndividuals remain the single largest group of people experiencing homelessness.\nIndividuals represent the largest subgroup of people experiencing homelessness. Since 2017, as housing costs rose and people faced greater challenges paying for rent, more individuals entered into homelessness. They simply had fewer housing options. Over the last couple of decades, the disappearance ofSingle Room Occupancy (SRO) units has coincided with rapid growths in single-person households. The lack of SROs impacts housing for people in various types of transitions, including young adults leaving their homes or foster care, those exiting relationships that involved co-habitating, people exiting institutions (prisons, jails, rehabilitation programs), or recent immigrants starting their lives in America. In 2024, 66 percent (512,007) of people experiencing homelessness were individuals. Among those living unshelteredUnsheltered Homelessness\nHUD defines “unsheltered” as sleeping in places not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation — such as tents, train stations, sheds, or garages unfit for habitation., 93 percent were individuals.\nRecurring homelessness among disabled people, most of whom are individuals, continues to rise in response to a shortage of accessible, affordable housing units.\nPeople who have experienced homelessness for at least a year — or four separate times in the past three years, totaling one year — while having a disabling condition (such as a physical disability, chronic illness, or a challenge with their behavioral health or substance use) are considered chronically homeless.\n- According to the 2024 PIT CountPoint-in-Time (PIT) Count\nHUD’s annual census of people experiencing homelessness — both sheltered and unsheltered — on a single night in January., 61 percent of people experiencing chronic homelessnessChronic Homelessness\nThe status of being homeless for at least a year — or on at least four separate occasions in the past three years — while experiencing a disabling condition such as a physical disability, serious mental illness or substance use disorder. were unshelteredUnsheltered Homelessness\nHUD defines “unsheltered” as sleeping in places not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation — such as tents, train stations, sheds, or garages unfit for habitation.. - A large share (37 percent) of individuals experiencing chronic homelessness lived in a suburban or a rural area. These areas also experienced the largest increases in chronic homelessness from 2023 to 2024 (12.7 percent and 21.6 percent respectively).\nFunding for deeply subsidized housing and services has not kept up with this population’s needs. Disabled people are often at a disadvantage when trying to access stable housing — they are paid subminimum wages and benefits, excluded from economic and housing opportunities, and face a high risk of eviction. Often, available housing does not meet their needs. As more people needed assistance and elected officials failed to invest enough resources to keep pace with this demand, people experiencing chronic homelessness increased rapidly.\nAs this population increased, some lawmakers endorsed ineffective approaches to chronic and unsheltered homelessness — like stigmatizing and punishing people who use substances or have mental health conditions but failed to enact real solutions. Abundant evidence demonstrates that homelessness is caused by a shortage of affordable housing and services for people in need. Punishing people experiencing homelessness only makes it more difficult to house them and does not improve public health or public safety. In fact, these policies waste money that could be used to address deep shortages in healthcare and affordable housing, as they further traumatize individuals who are simply trying to survive.\nOn the other hand, the solutions to chronic homelessness are clear. Permanent housingPermanent Housing\nHUD defines permanent housing as community-based housing with no set time limit, where participants hold a lease of at least one year, renewable monthly, and terminable only for cause., paired with wraparound voluntary services like healthcare, is most successful at keeping this population stably housed. Data suggest Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH)Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH)\nPermanent housing with housing assistance and supportive services to help households with a disabled member maintain housing stability. consistently keeps over 90 percent of its residents housed. It is likely that this also saves the public money. Because of how difficult it is to live outside, people experiencing chronic homelessness come into contact with costlier systems, including emergency rooms and jails, more frequently than the overall population. These costs go down when lawmakers invest in approaches grounded in the Housing First model, like PSH.\nDespite PSH being well-supported by evidence, proposals from the current administration seek to limit funding to programs using the Housing First model. This will be worsened by the funding expiration for Emergency Housing Vouchers, an extraordinarily successful investment introduced in 2021 to more rapidly connect vulnerable populations with housing. The United States could end chronic homelessness with a greater investment in PSH and other evidence-based strategies.\nChildren experienced the largest increases in homelessness, but adults continue to be more likely to experience it.\nKey data points related to homelessness vary by age group:\n- The number of childrenChildren\nThe term “children” refers to all people who are under the age of 18. The term “Youth” includes people who are under the age of 25. Both categories include youth who are in families and youth who are unaccompanied. experiencing homelessness increased 33 percent between 2023 and 2024 — the highest annual increase across all age groups. During the 2024 PIT CountPoint-in-Time (PIT) Count\nHUD’s annual census of people experiencing homelessness — both sheltered and unsheltered — on a single night in January., 148,238 people experiencing homelessness were under the age of 18. - Among adults, 35 out of every 10,000 people aged 35–44 experienced homelessness during the 2024 PIT Count — the highest rate of homelessness across all age groups.\n- Adults over 45 years of age experienced higher rates of unsheltered homelessnessUnsheltered Homelessness\nHUD defines “unsheltered” as sleeping in places not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation — such as tents, train stations, sheds, or garages unfit for habitation. than their younger counterparts.\nYouth (Under Age 25)\nDuring the 2024 PIT Count, 205,878 people (or 27 percent of all people who experienced homelessness) were under the age of 25. This is a 29 percent increase since 2023. According to research by Chapin Hall, one out of every 10 people 18 to 25 years of age experience homelessness at some point over the year.\nNot all young people are equally impacted. While the total number of unaccompanied youthUnaccompanied Youth\nHUD defines “unaccompanied youth” as people under the age of 25 who do not have children and are living without a parent or guardian present. Unaccompanied gender-expansive youth are also a part of this group. experiencing homelessness has increased 9 percent since the 2019 PIT Count, the number who are gender-expansiveGender Expansive\nPeople whose identity differs from their birth sex and/or who don’t solely identify as male or female. HUD asks people experiencing homelessness to select their gender identity, but the categories have changed over time. increased 57 percent. Research also indicates that Latino, Black, Asian, and Multiracial youth all experience homelessness at higher rates than youth overall.\nCurrently, less than 8 percent of children experience unsheltered homelessness, which is the lowest share among all age groups. Programs that target resources toward children and youth, including the federal Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (YHDP) and Runaway Homeless Youth Act, have been significantly successful in stabilizing the housing of youth throughout the country. However, some youth still go without shelter and recent federal-level policy proposals threaten to reduce or eliminate their funding.\nParenting Youth\nOf new concern is the fact that the number of parenting youthParenting Youth\nPeople under age 25 who are the parents or legal guardians of one or more children (under age 18) and live with their child(ren) without anyone above the age of 24. experiencing homelessness also increased 28 percent since 2023, reversing a downward trend since HUD began reporting data on parenting youth in 2015.\nOlder Adults\nOlder adults — those 55 and older — face unique challenges. They are the fastest-growing group of people experiencing homelessness in America and are increasingly cost-burdened Housing Cost Burdened\nCost-burdened households spend 30 percent or more of income on housing; severely cost-burdened spend 50 percent or more. as rising costs of living exceed Social Security Income. This is a growing crisis: the number of older adults experiencing homelessness is estimated to triple between 2017 and 2030.\nThe majority of people experiencing homelessness are men, but the number of women experiencing homelessness is growing quickly.\n- According to the 2024 PIT CountPoint-in-Time (PIT) Count\nHUD’s annual census of people experiencing homelessness — both sheltered and unsheltered — on a single night in January., 60 percent of people experiencing homelessness were men. - 28 out of every 10,000 men experienced homelessness, a 15 percent increase from 2023.\n- 18 out of every 10,000 women experienced homelessness, a 19 percent increase from 2023.\nIndividual men make up the majority of people experiencing homelessness, and men of color are overrepresented among individual men experiencing homelessness. However, homelessness among women is increasing at a faster pace than among men. Unsheltered homelessnessUnsheltered Homelessness\nHUD defines “unsheltered” as sleeping in places not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation — such as tents, train stations, sheds, or garages unfit for habitation. among both men and women decreased from 2023–2024, but men remained more likely to be unsheltered. Responding to the increased housing challenges among women addresses an emerging concern before it has an opportunity to worsen. At the same time, focusing on men living on their own (the largest subgroup within homelessness) would significantly reduce homelessness.\nHUD does not report data at the intersection of race and gender; however, men and women of color face specific challenges accessing safe and deeply affordable housing. Ensuring that people of color, and especially individuals of color, have access to housing will be an important step toward ensuring that everyone has the housing they need to contribute to more prosperous communities.\nGender-expansive people — people who identify as transgender, nonbinary, more than one gender, gender questioning, or a culturally specific identity — face discrimination, exclusion, and violence. Evidence suggests that these experiences push them into homelessness at higher rates.\nSince data reporting about this population began in 2015, gender-expansive peopleGender Expansive\nPeople whose identity differs from their birth sex and/or who don’t solely identify as male or female. HUD asks people experiencing homelessness to select their gender identity, but the categories have changed over time. have consistently experienced faster increases in homelessness and higher rates of unsheltered homelessnessUnsheltered Homelessness\nHUD defines “unsheltered” as sleeping in places not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation — such as tents, train stations, sheds, or garages unfit for habitation. than cisgender people. Gender-expansive people face housing discrimination, harassment, violence, employment discrimination, and barriers to accessing social safety nets. This leads to a heightened risk of homelessness. While it is likely that these systemic barriers have always caused high rates of gender-expansive homelessness, data collection is only beginning to capture the full impact that these barriers have on housing security.\nSince 2015, homelessness among gender-expansive people increased 618 percent, compared with a 35 percent increase among cisgender men and women. In part, these increases are attributable to HUD adding new categories to the PIT CountPoint-in-Time (PIT) Count\nHUD’s annual census of people experiencing homelessness — both sheltered and unsheltered — on a single night in January. that do a better job capturing the gender-expansive community. However, gender-expansive people are consistently overrepresented in the unsheltered population, indicating that they also continue to face greater challenges accessing shelter and permanent housingPermanent Housing\nHUD defines permanent housing as community-based housing with no set time limit, where participants hold a lease of at least one year, renewable monthly, and terminable only for cause.. Among gender questioning people and people with a culturally specific gender identity experiencing homelessness, 8 in 10 did not stay in shelter. These trends emphasize that gender-expansive people experiencing homelessness have not been reflected in policy and practice to the degree that is necessary to meet their needs.\nBased on independent analyses, it is also likely that gender-expansive people experience high rates of homelessness relative to their population size. A 2022 national survey of transgender people found that 34 percent of respondents were currently experiencing poverty, and 30 percent experienced homelessness during their lifetime. These factors point to the urgent need to create and expand policies that make services more accessible and inclusive for gender-expansive households.\nWhere People Experiencing Homelessness Live and Why It Matters\nPeople experience homelessness in every part of the United States. Large cities, small towns, wealthy communities, and under-resourced communities all have residents who are struggling and need support. Still, we could greatly accelerate progress toward ending homelessness in America by mobilizing effective interventions targeting a few geographic categories. This includes:\nStates with the Largest Homeless Populations\nIn January 2024, 64 percent of people experiencing homelessness lived in 7 states with significantly large urban areas: California, Illinois, Texas, Massachusetts, Florida, Washington, and New York.\nStates with the Fastest Growing Homeless Populations\nThe fastest increases in the number of people experiencing homelessness from 2023 to 2024 occurred in Colorado, West Virginia, Alabama, Hawaii, Illinois, and New York.\nNon-Urban Areas Struggling to Serve Everyone Living Outside\nIn January of 2024, 37 percent of people experiencing homelessness in suburban areas and 45 percent of people experiencing homelessness in (often geographically large) rural areas live unshelteredUnsheltered Homelessness\nHUD defines “unsheltered” as sleeping in places not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation — such as tents, train stations, sheds, or garages unfit for habitation.. When compared to urban areas, rural, and suburban communities tend to rely on federal resources the most.\nThus, Congress holds a significant role in bringing everyone in non-urban areas inside.\nTargeting attention on key categories of communities is helpful. But totally ending homelessness requires focusing on every community in America and charting their progress toward housing everyone in need. Therefore, a national strategy must incorporate the needs of all states and communities.\nOne way to understand these local needs is to examine the state population counts. Population counts reveal that, in 2024, many states experienced setbacks rooted in high housing costs, low-income growth, and weak safety nets. With the end of pandemic assistance to households, rising inflation, slower income growth, and an increase in natural disasters, more people faced challenges staying housed. Even states that had made progress reducing homelessness over the last decades saw increases in their homeless populations between 2023 and 2024. But some states were able to sustain progress.\nA second way to understand every state’s progress toward ending homelessness is to focus on experiences of homelessness per capita (i.e., comparing the size of the homeless and overall populations). High housing costs and a weak safety net can cause a greater percentage of a state’s residents to fall into homelessness. For example, states like California and Washington that have high housing costs also have relatively high percentages of people experiencing homelessness.\nThe United States Can End Homelessness — Communities Need Sustained Investments from Lawmakers\nThe homeless services sector provides shelter, housing and services to people experiencing homelessness with incredible success. Despite having too few resources and being consistently underpaid, they continue to serve more than a million people each year. Undoubtedly, without their work, far more people would remain homeless for much longer periods of time.\nDramatic cuts to programs will make it harder for people to access the support they need to stay housed. Efforts to fine, cite, arrest, and jail people experiencing unsheltered homelessnessUnsheltered Homelessness\nHUD defines “unsheltered” as sleeping in places not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation — such as tents, train stations, sheds, or garages unfit for habitation. will waste resources and temporarily hide, rather than permanently solve, the problem. By allocating more state and federal investments to expand the crisis response system, building and preserving affordable housing, and ensuring that people have access to voluntary supportive services like healthcare, the United States can end homelessness.\nHow do we know that ending homelessness is possible? At least two pieces of evidence help answer that question.\nFirst, the homelessness response system has a track record of success. It reduced overall homelessness and unsheltered homelessness from 2010 to 2019. It also ensured that homelessness did not spike during the pandemic, despite large increases in financial hardship. This is because Congress made large investments in Emergency Rental Assistance and income support. Although there have been large increases in the number of people experiencing homelessness in the past two years due to rising housing costs and inadequate incomes, past results suggest that investments can reduce homelessness. Investment levels have simply never been enough to completely end the need for a homelessness response.\nA second source of evidence for the United States’ ability to end homelessness is the “Ending Veteran Homelessness Initiative.” In 2009, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) collaborated with HUD to implement specific services for veterans experiencing homelessness.\nDuring this initiative, a federal evaluation found that veteran homelessness decreased 55 percent (compared to the 8 percent decrease among the overall population) from 2009 to 2022. To achieve this significant reduction, the VA and HUD:\nThe Housing First approach also saved taxpayers money. A VA analysis found that robust housing plus services was significantly less expensive than various costs associated with being unhoused (including for emergency healthcare, criminal legal system costs, and other social services).\nFrom 2022 to 2023, the resources to support this approach did not keep up with increases in veteran homelessness. Lawmakers noticed and responded with a small increase in the number of housing vouchers available to veterans in 2024. Lawmakers can sustain and expand these increases to fully meet the needs of veterans. They should also offer similar housing and services to the rest of the population experiencing homelessness. People need affordable housing and services to stay housed and contribute to their communities.\nThe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs approach demonstrates that when it is sustainably funded to meet communities’ needs, the homelessness response system can rehouse people experiencing homelessness and help to keep them housed. Lawmakers need to learn from this success and ensure that the response system has the resources required to serve everyone currently experiencing homelessness. Like the VA, they also need to reduce the number of people becoming homeless and make it easier for the response system to rehouse people more quickly. They can do this by expanding deeply affordable housing development, preserving the affordability of existing housing, and expanding rental assistance and other safety net programs, like income support and affordable healthcare programs.\nThe VA was successful because it provided deeply affordable permanent housing, accessible temporary shelter, rental assistance, and programs that provide wraparound services with the funds they require to make these life-saving resources universally available to people in need. Keeping people housed, quickly rehousing people when homelessness does occur, and targeting programs to those communities and populations who are most at risk of homelessness can help to promote more prosperous communities for everyone.\nEndnotes\n- Department of Housing and Urban Development, “CoC System Performance Measures” (Accessed May 2025).

The tax rate reductions ranged from just 1 percentage point in Austria and Cabo Verde to 3 percentage points in the Syrian Arab Republic.\nAdditionally, in 2024, five countries with statutory corporate tax rates below 15 percent—Bulgaria, Hungary, Ireland, Lichtenstein, and Barbados—implemented the QDMTT from the Pillar Two rules, raising their effective corporate tax rate for large companies to 15 percent.\nTable 1: Notable Corporate Income Tax Rate Changes in 2024\n| Country | 2023 Tax Rate | 2024 Tax Rate | 2024 Tax Rate Accounting for Global Minimum Tax | Change from 2023 to 2024 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Africa | ||||\n| Cabo Verde | 22.44% | 21.42% | 21.42% | -1.02 ppt |\n| Morocco | 32% | 33% | 33% | +1 ppt |\n| Rwanda | 30% | 28% | 28% | -2 ppt |\n| Swaziland | 27.5% | 25% | 25% | -2.5 ppt |\n| Asia | ||||\n| Syrian Arab Republic | 28% | 25% | 25% | -3 ppt |\n| Europe | ||||\n| Austria | 24% | 23% | 23% | -1 ppt |\n| Belarus | 20% | 25% | 25% | +5 ppt |\n| Bulgaria | 10% | 10% | 15% | 0 ppt/+5 ppt |\n| Czechia | 19% | 21% | 21% | +2 ppt |\n| Gibraltar | 12.5% | 15% | 15% | +2.5 ppt |\n| Hungary | 9% | 9% | 15% | 0 ppt/+6 ppt |\n| Iceland | 20% | 21% | 21% | +1 ppt |\n| Ireland | 12.5% | 12.5% | 15% | 0 ppt/+2.5 ppt |\n| Liechtenstein | 12.5% | 12.5% | 15% | 0 ppt/+2.5 ppt |\n| Slovenia | 19% | 22% | 22% | +3 ppt |\n| North America | ||||\n| Barbados | 5.50% | 9% | 15% | +3.5 ppt /+9.5 ppt |\n| Oceania | ||||\n| Fiji | 20 | 25 | 25 | +5 ppt |\nScheduled Corporate Tax Rate Changes in the OECD and Selected Jurisdictions\nAmong OECD countries, Estonia and Lithuania have announced they will implement changes to their statutory corporate income tax rates in 2025. Additionally, Morocco and Slovenia have enacted changes to their statutory corporate income taxes that will take place over the coming years.\n- In Estonia, the corporate income tax will be increased from 20 percent in 2024 to 22 percent in 2025.[5]\n- In Lithuania, the corporate income tax will increase from 15 percent in 2024 to 16 percent in 2025.[6]\n- In Morocco, the top corporate income tax was increased from 31 percent to 35 percent for companies with a taxable income higher than MAD 100 million (USD 9.9 million). However, this increase will be introduced over three years, with a one percentage point increase each year. For the fiscal year of 2024, the corporate income tax rate applicable is 33 percent.[7]\n- In Slovenia, the top corporate income tax was increased temporarily, from 19 percent to 22 percent, for five years, until 2028. This five-year tax is set to finance the reconstruction efforts after the major floods that occurred in August 2023.[8]\nThe Impact of Global Minimum Tax\nMore than 140 countries have already agreed to a set of rules for a 15 percent global minimum tax, as part of the 2021 global tax agreement coordinated by the OECD. The global minimum tax, also known as Pillar Two, includes three main rules. The first is a qualified domestic minimum top-up tax, which countries could use to claim the first right to tax profits currently being taxed below the minimum effective rate of 15 percent. The second is an income inclusion rule, which determines when the foreign income of a company should be included in the taxable income of the parent company. When a company’s effective tax rate falls below 15 percent, additional taxes would be owed in its home jurisdiction. The third rule in Pillar Two is the undertaxed profits rule, which would allow a country to increase taxes on a company if another related entity in a different jurisdiction was being taxed below the 15 percent effective rate. If multiple countries apply a similar top-up tax, the taxable profit would be divided based on the location of tangible assets and employees.\nThese model rules are incentivizing countries around the world to implement a corporate income tax for the first time.\nThe United Arab Emirates, which introduced a 9 percent federal corporate income tax in 2023, will now impose a minimum top-up tax of 15 percent on large multinational companies operating in the country starting January 1, 2025.[9]\nBermuda has also introduced a minimum 15 percent corporate income tax. In recent years, the Bermuda government extended a tax exemptionA tax exemption excludes certain income, revenue, or even taxpayers from tax altogether. For example, nonprofits that fulfill certain requirements are granted tax-exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), preventing them from having to pay income tax. granted to Bermuda companies until March 2035. This exemption is supposed to protect companies from any newly enacted taxes on income or capital gains until March 2035. However, in December 2023, Bermuda introduced a 15 percent corporate income tax on multinational companies with annual revenue of EUR 750 million or more, effective from 2025.[10]\nAdditionally, in May 2023, the governments of Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man agreed on a joint internal approach to Pillar Two starting in 2025.[11]\nAt the end of 2022, the EU also adopted its own Pillar Two directive. The EU obliges Member States with more than 12 in-scope multinational groups to implement the IIR starting December 31, 2023, and the UTPR starting December 31, 2024. Member States with no more than 12 in-scope multinational groups can elect to defer implementing both rules for six years under Article 50 of the Directive.[12]\nAs of 2024, 28 countries have adopted both the IIR and the QDMTT, three countries—Cyprus, Japan, and the Republic of Korea—have adopted only the IIR, and five countries—Barbados, Gibraltar, Slovakia, Switzerland, and Zimbabwe—have only adopted the QDMTT. Thirty countries are planning to adopt the UTPR rules by the end of 2025, and more than 47 countries are set to adopt at least the QDMTT rules by 2026.[13]\nHowever, while countries are looking for ways to implement the global minimum tax, they are also considering new qualified refundable tax creditA refundable tax credit can be used to generate a federal tax refund larger than the amount of tax paid throughout the year. In other words, a refundable tax credit creates the possibility of a negative federal tax liability. An example of a refundable tax credit is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). incentives for multinational companies allowed under the framework to continue competing for investment.[14]\nThe Highest and Lowest Corporate Tax Rates in the World\nOne hundred and forty-three of the 225 separate jurisdictions surveyed in 2024 have corporate tax rates at or below 25 percent.[15] One hundred and twenty-five have rates above 20 percent but below or at 30 percent. The average rate among the 225 jurisdictions is 23.51 percent.[16] The United States has the 82nd-highest corporate tax rate with a combined federal and state statutory rate of 25.63 percent.[17]\nThe 20 countries with the highest statutory corporate income tax rates span almost every region, albeit unequally. While eight of the top 20 countries are in Africa, Oceania appears only once and Europe twice. Of the remaining jurisdictions, four are in North America, and five are in South America.\nTable 2. 20 Highest Statutory Corporate Income Tax Rates in the World, 2024\n| Country | Continent | Tax Rate |\n|---|---|---|\n| Comoros* | Africa | 50% |\n| Puerto Rico | North America | 37.5% |\n| Suriname | South America | 36% |\n| Argentina | South America | 35% |\n| Chad | Africa | 35% |\n| Colombia | South America | 35% |\n| Cuba | North America | 35% |\n| Equatorial Guinea | Africa | 35% |\n| Malta | Europe | 35% |\n| Sudan | Africa | 35% |\n| Sint Maarten (Dutch part) | North America | 34.5% |\n| American Samoa | Oceania | 34% |\n| Brazil | South America | 34% |\n| Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) | South America | 34% |\n| Cameroon | Africa | 33% |\n| Saint Kitts and Nevis | North America | 33% |\n| Morocco | Africa | 32% |\n| Mozambique | Africa | 32% |\n| Namibia | Africa | 32% |\n| Portugal | Europe | 31.5% |\nSource: OECD, “Corporate income tax statutory and targeted small business rates,” updated September 2024; PwC, “Worldwide Tax Summaries – Corporate Taxes,” 2024, https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/; Bloomberg Tax, “Country Guides – Corporate Tax Rates,” accessed November 2024, https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/tax/toc_view_menu/3380; and researched individually, see Tax Foundation, “worldwide-corporate-tax-rates,” GitHub, https://github.com/TaxFoundation/worldwide-corporate-tax-rates.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, of the 20 countries with the lowest non-zero statutory corporate tax rates, 18 charge rates at or below 15 percent. Nine countries have statutory rates of 10 percent, five being small European nations (Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Kosovo, and Macedonia). The only two OECD members represented among the bottom 20 countries are Hungary and Ireland. Hungary reduced its corporate income tax rate from 19 to 9 percent in 2017. Ireland has had its 12.5 percent rate in place since 2003. In 2024, of the 18 countries with corporate tax rates below 15 percent, five—Bulgaria, Hungary, Ireland, Lichtenstein, and Barbados—have implemented the QDMTT from the Pillar Two rules, raising their effective corporate tax rate to 15 percent.\nTable 3. 20 Lowest Statutory Corporate Income Tax Rates in the World, 2024\n| Country | Continent | Tax Rate | Tax Rate Accounting for Global Minimum Tax |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Turkmenistan | Asia | 8% | 8% |\n| Barbados | North America | 9% | 15% |\n| Hungary | Europe | 9% | 15% |\n| United Arab Emirates | Asia | 9% | 9% |\n| Andorra | Europe | 10% | 10% |\n| Bosnia and Herzegovina | Europe | 10% | 10% |\n| Bulgaria | Europe | 10% | 15% |\n| Republic of Kosovo | Europe | 10% | 10% |\n| Kyrgyzstan | Asia | 10% | 10% |\n| Paraguay | South America | 10% | 10% |\n| Qatar | Asia | 10% | 10% |\n| The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia | Europe | 10% | 10% |\n| Timor-Leste | Oceania | 10% | 10% |\n| China, Macao Special Administrative Region | Asia | 12% | 12% |\n| Republic of Moldova | Europe | 12% | 12% |\n| Cyprus | Europe | 12.5% | 12.5% |\n| Ireland | Europe | 12.5% | 15% |\n| Liechtenstein | Europe | 12.5% | 15% |\n| Albania* | Europe | 15% | 15% |\n| Georgia* | Asia | 15% | 15% |\n*Apart from Albania and Georgia, there are 12 other countries with a corporate tax rate of 15 percent that are not shown in this table.\nSource: OECD, “Corporate income tax statutory and targeted small business rates”; PwC, “Worldwide Tax Summaries – Corporate Taxes”; Bloomberg Tax, “Country Guides – Corporate Tax Rates”; and researched individually, see Tax Foundation, “worldwide-corporate-tax-rates.”\nOf the 225 jurisdictions surveyed, 15 currently do not impose a general corporate income tax. All these jurisdictions are small, island nations. A handful, such as the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, are well known for their lack of corporate taxes.\nTable 4.

Statutory corporate income tax rate” and “Statutory Corporate Income Tax Rates”; PwC, “Worldwide Tax Summaries – Corporate Taxes”; Bloomberg Tax, “Country Guides – Corporate Tax Rates.”\nRegional Variation in Corporate Tax Rates\nCorporate tax rates can vary significantly by region. South America has the highest average statutory corporate tax rate among all regions at 28.38 percent. Asia has the lowest average statutory corporate tax rate among all regions at 19.74 percent.\nWhen weighted by GDP, South America has the highest average statutory corporate tax rate at 32.67 percent, while Europe has the lowest at 24.39 percent.\nIn general, larger and more industrialized nations tend to have higher corporate income tax rates than smaller nations. The G7, which is comprised of the seven wealthiest nations in the world, has an average statutory corporate income tax rate of 27.15 percent and a weighted average rate of 26.63 percent. OECD member states have an average statutory corporate tax rate of 23.85 percent and a rate of 26.12 percent when weighted by GDP. The BRICS[18] have an average statutory rate of 27.20 percent and a weighted average statutory corporate income tax rate of 26.22 percent.\nWhen accounting for the global minimum tax, there are no significant changes in the weighted averages of the regions analyzed. However, when comparing the unweighted averages, both Europe (20.53 percent) and North America (25.84 percent) have slightly higher average rates when accounting for the global minimum than without the global minimum tax (20.18 percent and 25.59 percent, respectively). Additionally, when accounting for the global minimum tax, the OECD average rate raises from 23.85 percent to 24.08 percent, while the European Union average raises from 21.27 percent to 21.77 percent.\nTable 5.

Countries in Africa and South America tend to have higher corporate tax rates than Asian and European jurisdictions. Oceania’s and North America’s corporate tax rates tend to be close to the world average.\nDistribution of Corporate Tax Rates\nOnly three tax jurisdictions impose a corporate income tax at statutory rates greater than 35 percent. [19] The following chart shows a distribution of corporate income tax rates among 225 jurisdictions in 2024. A plurality of countries (125 total) impose a rate above 20 percent and below or at 30 percent. Seventeen jurisdictions have a statutory corporate tax rate above 30 percent and below or at 35 percent. Eighty jurisdictions have a statutory corporate tax rate below or at 20 percent, and 205 jurisdictions have a corporate tax rate below or at 30 percent.\nThe Decline of Corporate Tax Rates since 1980 Leveled Off in Recent Years\nOver the past 44 years, corporate tax rates have consistently declined on a global basis. In 1980, the unweighted average worldwide statutory tax rate was 40.18 percent. Today, the average statutory rate stands at 23.51 percent—a 41 percent reduction—and 23.62 percent when accounting for the global minimum tax.[20]\nDespite a general decline in corporate tax rates around the world, OECD and non-OECD countries have also become more reliant on revenue from corporate income taxes. One cause for this change has been a shift in the jurisdictions included.[21] Secondly, the negative revenue impact of the decline in corporate tax rates was generally offset by reducing or abolishing tax relief policies. [22]\nThe weighted average statutory rate has remained higher than the simple average over this period. Prior to US tax reform in 2017, the United States was largely responsible for keeping the weighted average higher, given its relatively high tax rate, as well as its significant contribution to global GDP. Figure 4 shows the significant impact the change in the US corporate rate had on the worldwide weighted average. The weighted average statutory corporate income tax rate has declined from 46.66 percent in 1980 to 25.67 percent (25.7 percent when accounting for the global minimum tax) in 2024, representing a 45 percent reduction over the 44 years surveyed.\nOver time, more countries have shifted to taxing corporations at rates of 30 percent or lower, with the United States following this trend with its tax changes at the end of 2017. The largest shift occurred between 1990 and 2000, with 49 percent of countries imposing a statutory rate below 30 percent in 2000 and only 27 percent of countries in the dataset imposing a statutory rate below 30 percent in 1990. This trend continued between 2000 and 2010, with 79 percent of countries imposing a statutory rate below 30 percent in 2010. Currently, 91 percent of countries impose a statutory rate below 30 percent.[23]\nAll regions saw a net decline in average statutory rates between 1980 and 2024. The average declined the most in Europe, with the 1980 average of 44.6 percent dropping to 20.18 percent (20.53 percent when accounting for the global minimum tax)—a 55 percent decline. South America has seen the smallest decline, with the average only decreasing by 23 percent, from 36.66 percent in 1980 to 28.38 percent in 2024.\nSouth America saw two periods, 1990-2000 and 2010-2024, during which the average statutory rate increased slightly by less than 0.5 percentage points, although the average rate decreased over the full 44-year period.\nConclusion\nWorldwide and regional average top statutory corporate tax rates have declined over the past four decades due to countries turning to more efficient tax types.[24] However, they have leveled off in recent years. Of the 225 jurisdictions around the world, only eight have increased their top corporate income tax rates in 2024, while five low-tax jurisdictions raised their effective corporate tax rates by implementing the global minimum tax, a trend that might be reversed in the coming years as more countries will be implementing the global minimum tax.\nCompare All 2024 Corporate Tax Rates\nTable 6.

states and dependent territories around the world. Tax rates were researched only for jurisdictions that are among the around 250 sovereign states and dependent territories that have been assigned a country code by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). As a result, zones or territories that are independent taxing jurisdictions but do not have their own country code are generally not included in the dataset.\nIn addition, the dataset includes historic statutory corporate income tax rates from 1980 to 2022. However, these years cover tax rates of fewer than 225 jurisdictions due to missing data points. Please let Tax Foundation know if you are aware of any sources for historic corporate tax rates that are not mentioned in this report, as we constantly strive to improve our datasets.\nTo be able to calculate average statutory corporate income tax rates weighted by GDP, the dataset includes GDP data for 181 jurisdictions. When used to calculate average statutory corporate income tax rates, either weighted by GDP or unweighted, only these 181 jurisdictions are included (to ensure the comparability of the unweighted and weighted averages).\nDefinition of Selected Corporate Income Tax Rate\nThe dataset captures standard top statutory corporate income tax rates levied on domestic businesses. This means:\n- The dataset does not reflect special tax regimes, including but not limited to patent boxes, offshore regimes, or special rates for specific industries.\n- A number of countries levy lower rates for businesses below a certain revenue threshold. The dataset does not capture these lower rates.\n- A few countries levy gross revenue taxes on businesses instead of corporate income taxes. Since the tax rates of a corporate income tax and a gross revenue tax are not comparable, these countries are excluded from the dataset.\n- Some countries have a separate tax rate for nonresident companies. This dataset does not consider nonresident tax rates that differ from the general corporate rate.\nSources\nTax Rates for the Year 2024\nFor OECD and non-OECD countries, the statutory corporate income tax rates used are the combined corporate income tax rates provided by the OECD; see OECD, “Corporate income tax statutory and targeted small business rates,” updated September 2024. Another source used for non-OECD jurisdictions is the statutory rates provided by PwC, “Worldwide Tax Summaries – Corporate Taxes,” 2024, https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/. The study also relies on Bloomberg Tax, “Country Guides – Corporate Tax Rates,” accessed in November 2024, https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/tax/toc_view_menu/3380. Jurisdictions that are not part of these sources were researched individually. The source for each of these jurisdictions is listed in a GitHub repository; see Tax Foundation, “worldwide-corporate-tax-rates,” GitHub, https://github.com/TaxFoundation/worldwide-corporate-tax-rates.\nTo calculate the 2024 tax rates accounting for the global minimum tax, the Pillar Two country tracker was used; see PwC, “Pillar Two Country Tracker,” accessed Dec. 2, 2024, https://pwc.com/gx/en/services/tax/pillar-two-readiness/country-tracker.html.\nTax Rates for the Years 1980-2023\nTax rates for the time frame between 1980 and 2023 are taken from a dataset compiled by the Tax Foundation over the last few years. These historic rates come from multiple sources: PwC, “Worldwide Tax Summaries – Corporate Taxes,” 2010-2023; KPMG, “Corporate Tax Rate Survey,” 1998- 2003; KPMG, “Corporate tax rates table,” 2003-2019; EY, “Worldwide Corporate Tax Guide,” 2004-2019; OECD, “Historical Table II.1 – Statutory corporate income tax rate,” 1999, https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?tenant=archive&df[ds]=DisseminateArchiveDMZ&df[id]=DF_TABLE_II1&df[ag]=OECD&dq=.&lom=LASTNPERIODS&lo=5&to[TIME_PERIOD]=false; the University of Michigan – Ross School of Business, “World Tax Database,” https://www.bus.umich.edu/otpr/otpr/default.asp; and numerous government websites.\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) for the Years 1980-2024\nGDP calculations are from the US Department of Agriculture, “International Macroeconomics Data Set- Historical and projected real gross domestic product (GDP) and growth rates of GDP for baseline countries/regions (in billions of 2017 dollars) 1970-2034,” Nov. 15 , 2024, https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/international-macroeconomic-data-set/.\nReferences\n[1] Unless otherwise noted, calculated averages of statutory corporate income tax rates only include jurisdictions for which GDP data is available for all years between 1980 and 2024. For 2024, the dataset includes statutory corporate income tax rates of 225 jurisdictions, but GDP data is available for only 181 of these jurisdictions, reducing the number of jurisdictions included in calculated averages to 181. For years prior to 2024, the number of countries included in calculated averages varies by year due to missing corporate tax rates; that is, the 1980 average includes statutory corporate income tax rates of 75 jurisdictions, compared to 181 jurisdictions in 2024.\n[2] Statutory rates are from OECD, “Corporate income tax statutory and targeted small business rates,” updated September 2024; PwC, “Worldwide Tax Summaries – Corporate Taxes,” 2023, https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/; Bloomberg Tax, “Country Guides – Corporate Tax Rates,” accessed November 2023, https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/tax/toc_view_menu/3380; and researched individually, see Tax Foundation, “worldwide-corporate-tax-rates,” GitHub, https://github.com/TaxFoundation/worldwide-corporate-tax-rates.

Many companies are not subject to the CIT because they are taxed as pass-through businesses, with income reportable under the individual income tax. rates. Six countries—Belarus, Morocco, Sri Lanka, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom—increased their top corporate taxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. rates, while 7 countries—including Austria and Guinea—reduced their corporate tax rates.\n- The countries with the highest corporate tax rates in the world are Comoros (50 percent), Puerto Rico (37.5 percent), and Suriname (36 percent), while the countries with the lowest corporate rates are Barbados (5.5 percent), Turkmenistan (8 percent), and Hungary (9 percent). Fifteen jurisdictions do not impose a corporate tax.\n- Some low-tax jurisdictions that previously did not have a corporate income tax have implemented or are exploring implementation options due to the Organisation for Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two agreement. These include the United Arab Emirates, Bermuda, Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man.\n- The worldwide average statutory corporate income tax rate, measured across 181 jurisdictions, is 23.45 percent. When weighted by GDP, the average statutory rate is 25.67 percent.\n- Asia has the lowest regional average rate at 19.80 percent, while South America has the highest regional average statutory rate at 28.38 percent. However, when weighted by GDP, Europe has the lowest regional average rate at 24.49 percent and South America has the highest at 32.65 percent.\n- The average top corporate rate among EU Member States is 21.13 percent, 23.73 percent in OECD countries, and 27.18 percent in the G7.\n- The worldwide average statutory corporate tax rate has consistently decreased since 1980 but has leveled off in recent years.\n- The average statutory corporate tax rate has declined in every region since 1980.\nIntroduction\nIn 1980, corporate tax rates around the world averaged 40.18 percent, and 46.83 percent when weighted by GDP.[1] Since then, countries have recognized the impact that high corporate tax rates have on business investment decisions; in 2023, the average is now 23.45 percent, and 25.67 when weighted by GDP, for 181 separate tax jurisdictions.[2]\nDeclines have been seen in every major region of the world, including in the largest economies. In the United States, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act brought the country’s statutory corporate income tax rate from the fourth highest in the world closer to the middle of the distribution.[3]\nAsian and European countries tend to have lower corporate income tax rates than countries in other regions, and many developing countries have corporate income tax rates that are above the worldwide average.\nToday, most countries have corporate tax rates below 30 percent.\nNotable Corporate Tax Rate Changes in 2023\nThirteen countries changed their statutory corporate income tax rates in 2023. Six countries increased their top corporate rates: Morocco (31 percent to 32 percent), United Arab Emirates (0 percent to 9 percent), Sri Lanka (24 percent to 30 percent), Turkey (23 percent to 25 percent), Belarus (18 percent to 20 percent) and the United Kingdom (19 percent to 25 percent). In 2023, the United Arab Emirates introduced a federal corporate tax of 9 percent on taxable income above AED 375,000 (USD 102,000). However, the new corporate income tax will not apply to the extraction of natural resources as these activities are already subject to taxation in the Emirates.[4]\nSeven countries across four continents—Guinea, South Africa, Bangladesh, the Republic of Korea, Austria, Aruba, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines—reduced their corporate tax rates in 2023. The tax rate reductions ranged from just 1 percentage point in Austria, the Republic of Korea, and South Africa, to 10 percentage points in Guinea.\nTable 1: Notable Corporate Income Tax Rate Changes in 2023\n| Country | 2022 Tax Rate | 2023 Tax Rate | Change from 2022 to 2023 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Africa | |||\n| Guinea | 35% | 25% | -10 ppt |\n| Morocco | 31% | 32% | +1 ppt |\n| South Africa | 28% | 27% | -1 ppt |\n| Asia | |||\n| United Arab Emirates | 0% | 9% | +9 ppt |\n| Bangladesh | 30% | 27.5% | -2.5 ppt |\n| Republic of Korea | 27.5% | 26.5% | -1 ppt |\n| Sri Lanka | 24% | 30% | +6 ppt |\n| Turkey | 23% | 25% | +2 ppt |\n| Europe | |||\n| Austria | 25% | 24% | -1 ppt |\n| Belarus | 18% | 20% | +2 ppt |\n| United Kingdom | 19% | 25% | +6 ppt |\n| North America | |||\n| Aruba | 25% | 22% | -3 ppt |\n| Saint Vincent and the Grenadines | 30% | 28% | -2 ppt |\nScheduled Corporate Tax Rate Changes in the OECD and Selected Jurisdictions\nAmong OECD countries, Austria and Morocco have announced they will implement changes to their statutory corporate income tax rate over the coming years.\n- In Austria, the corporate income tax will be cut from 24 percent in 2023 to 23 percent in 2024.[5]\n- In Morocco, the top corporate income tax was increased from 31 percent to 35 percent for companies with a taxable income higher than MAD 100 million (USD 9.9 million). However, this increase will be introduced over three years, with a one percentage point increase each For the fiscal year of 2023, the corporate income tax rate applicable is 32 percent. [6]\nThe Impact of Global Minimum Tax\nMore than 140 countries have already agreed to a 15 percent global minimum tax, as part of the 2021 global tax agreement coordinated by the OECD. The model rules defined by the OECD under the global minimum tax, also known as Pillar Two, are incentivizing countries around the world to implement a corporate income tax for the first time.\nApart from the United Arab Emirates, which has recently introduced a 9 percent federal corporate income tax, Bermuda is also considering introducing a corporate income tax for the first time.\nIn recent years, the Bermuda government extended the tax exemptionA tax exemption excludes certain income, revenue, or even taxpayers from tax altogether. For example, nonprofits that fulfill certain requirements are granted tax-exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), preventing them from having to pay income tax. granted to Bermuda companies until March 2035. This exemption is supposed to protect companies from any newly enacted taxes on income or capital gains until March 2035.[7] However, in October 2023, to “minimize top-up taxes” levied on Bermuda multinational companies, draft legislation was presented to adopt a 15 percent statutory corporate income tax.[8]\nAdditionally, in May 2023, the governments of Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man agreed on a joint internal approach to Pillar Two starting in 2025.[9]\nAt the end of 2022, the EU also adopted its own Pillar Two directive and all Member States have committed to implement the EU rules. The Member States are obliged to implement the rules by 31 December 2023.[10] While some Member States required to implement the directive are not expected to meet the end of 2023 deadline, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, and the Slovak Republic already announced that they intend to defer the application to a later date as this is allowed by the directive under certain conditions.\nHowever, while countries are looking for ways to implement the global minimum tax rate, they are also considering new qualified refundable tax creditA refundable tax credit can be used to generate a federal tax refund larger than the amount of tax paid throughout the year. In other words, a refundable tax credit creates the possibility of a negative federal tax liability. An example of a refundable tax credit is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). incentives for multinational companies allowed under the framework to continue competing for investment.[11]\nThe Highest and Lowest Corporate Tax Rates in the World\nOne hundred and forty-one of the 225 separate jurisdictions surveyed in 2023 have corporate tax rates at or below 25 percent.[12] One hundred and twenty have rates above 20 percent but below or at 30 percent. The average rate among the 225 jurisdictions is 22.27 percent.[13] The United States has the 84th-highest corporate tax rate with a combined federal and state statutory rate of 25.77 percent.[14]\nThe 20 countries with the highest statutory corporate income tax rates span almost every region, albeit unequally. While eight of the top 20 countries are in Africa, Oceania appears only once and Europe twice. Of the remaining jurisdictions, four are in North America, and five are in South America.\nTable 2: 20 Highest Statutory Corporate Income Tax Rates in the World, 2023\n| Country | Continent | Tax Rate |\n|---|---|---|\n| Comoros* | Africa | 50% |\n| Puerto Rico | North America | 37.5% |\n| Suriname | South America | 36% |\n| Argentina | South America | 35% |\n| Chad | Africa | 35% |\n| Colombia | South America | 35% |\n| Cuba | North America | 35% |\n| Equatorial Guinea | Africa | 35% |\n| Malta | Europe | 35% |\n| Sudan | Africa | 35% |\n| Sint Maarten (Dutch part) | North America | 34.5% |\n| American Samoa | Oceania | 34% |\n| Brazil | South America | 34% |\n| Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) | South America | 34% |\n| Cameroon | Africa | 33% |\n| Saint Kitts and Nevis | North America | 33% |\n| Morocco | Africa | 32% |\n| Mozambique | Africa | 32% |\n| Namibia | Africa | 32% |\n| Portugal | Europe | 31.5% |\nSources: Statutory corporate income tax rates are from OECD, “Table II.1.

Nine countries have statutory rates of 10 percent, five being small European nations (Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Kosovo, and Macedonia). The only two OECD members represented among the bottom 20 countries are Hungary and Ireland. Hungary reduced its corporate income tax rate from 19 to 9 percent in 2017. Ireland has had its 12.5 percent rate in place since 2003.\nTable 3: 20 Lowest Statutory Corporate Income Tax Rates in the World, 2023 (Excluding Jurisdictions with a Corporate Income Tax Rate of Zero Percent)\n| Country | Continent | Tax Rate |\n|---|---|---|\n| Barbados | North America | 5.5% |\n| Turkmenistan | Asia | 8% |\n| Hungary | Europe | 9% |\n| United Arab Emirates | Asia | 9% |\n| Andorra | Europe | 10% |\n| Bosnia and Herzegovina | Europe | 10% |\n| Bulgaria | Europe | 10% |\n| Republic of Kosovo | Europe | 10% |\n| Kyrgyzstan | Asia | 10% |\n| Paraguay | South America | 10% |\n| Qatar | Asia | 10% |\n| The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia | Europe | 10% |\n| Timor-Leste | Oceania | 10% |\n| China, Macao Special Administrative Region | Asia | 12% |\n| Republic of Moldova | Europe | 12% |\n| Cyprus | Europe | 12.5% |\n| Gibraltar | Europe | 12.5% |\n| Ireland | Europe | 12.5% |\n| Liechtenstein | Europe | 12.5% |\n| Albania | Europe | 15% |\nOf the 225 jurisdictions surveyed, 15 currently do not impose a general corporate income tax.

A handful, such as the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, are well known for their lack of corporate taxes.\nTable 4: Countries without General Corporate Income Tax, 2023\n| Country | Continent |\n|---|---|\n| Anguilla | North America |\n| Bahamas | North America |\n| Bahrain* | Asia |\n| Belize* | North America |\n| Bermuda | North America |\n| British Virgin Islands | North America |\n| Cayman Islands | North America |\n| Guernsey | Europe |\n| Isle of Man | Europe |\n| Jersey | Europe |\n| Saint Barthelemy | North America |\n| Tokelau | Oceania |\n| Turks and Caicos Islands | North America |\n| Vanuatu | Oceania |\n| Wallis and Futuna Islands | Oceania |\nSources: OECD, “Table II.1. Statutory corporate income tax rate” and “Statutory Corporate Income Tax Rates”; PwC, “Worldwide Tax Summaries – Corporate Taxes”; Bloomberg Tax, “Country Guides – Corporate Tax Rates.”\nRegional Variation in Corporate Tax Rates\nCorporate tax rates can vary significantly by region. South America has the highest average statutory corporate tax rate among all regions at 28.38 percent. Asia has the lowest average statutory corporate tax rate among all regions at 19.80 percent.\nWhen weighted by GDP, South America has the highest average statutory corporate tax rate at 32.65 percent, while Europe has the lowest at 24.49 percent.\nIn general, larger and more industrialized nations tend to have higher corporate income tax rates than smaller nations. The G7, which is comprised of the seven wealthiest nations in the world, has an average statutory corporate income tax rate of 27.18 percent and a weighted average rate of 26.68 percent. OECD member states have an average statutory corporate tax rate of 23.73 percent and a rate of 26.16 percent when weighted by GDP. The BRICS[15] have an average statutory rate of 27.20 percent and a weighted average statutory corporate income tax rate of 26.11 percent.\nTable 5: Average Corporate Tax Rate by Region or Group, 2023\n| Region | Average Rate | Average Rate Weighted by GDP | Number of Countries Covered |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Africa | 27.37% | 27.28% | 51 |\n| Asia | 19.80% | 25.02% | 47 |\n| Europe | 19.92% | 24.49% | 39 |\n| North America | 25.46% | 26.10% | 24 |\n| Oceania | 23.75% | 29.72% | 8 |\n| South America | 28.38% | 32.65% | 12 |\n| G7 | 27.18% | 26.68% | 7 |\n| OECD | 23.73% | 26.16% | 38 |\n| BRICS | 27.20% | 26.11% | 5 |\n| European Union | 21.13% | 25.21% | 27 |\n| G20 | 27.09% | 26.51% | 19 |\n| World | 23.45% | 25.67% | 181 |\nThe following map illustrates the current state of corporate tax rates around the world. Countries in Africa and South America tend to have higher corporate tax rates than Asian and European jurisdictions. Oceania’s and North America’s corporate tax rates tend to be close to the world average.\nDistribution of Corporate Tax Rates\nOnly three tax jurisdictions impose a corporate income tax at statutory rates greater than 35 percent. [16] The following chart shows a distribution of corporate income tax rates among 225 jurisdictions in 2023. A plurality of countries (120 total) impose a rate above 20 percent and below or at 30 percent. Seventeen jurisdictions have a statutory corporate tax rate above 30 percent and below or at 35 percent. Eighty-five jurisdictions have a statutory corporate tax rate below or at 20 percent, and 205 jurisdictions have a corporate tax rate below or at 30 percent.\nThe Decline of Corporate Tax Rates since 1980 Leveled Off in Recent Years\nOver the past 43 years, corporate tax rates have consistently declined on a global basis. In 1980, the unweighted average worldwide statutory tax rate was 40.18 percent. Today, the average statutory rate stands at 23.45 percent—a 42 percent reduction.[17]\nDespite a general decline in corporate tax rates around the world, OECD and non-OECD countries have also become more reliant on revenue from corporate income taxes. One cause for this change has been a shift in the jurisdictions included.[18] Secondly, the negative revenue impact of the decline in corporate tax rates was generally offset by reducing or abolishing tax relief policies. [19]\nThe weighted average statutory rate has remained higher than the simple average over this period. Prior to U.S. tax reform in 2017, the United States was largely responsible for keeping the weighted average higher, given its relatively high tax rate, as well as its significant contribution to global GDP. Figure 3 shows the significant impact the change in the U.S. corporate rate had on the worldwide weighted average. The weighted average statutory corporate income tax rate has declined from 46.83 percent in 1980 to 25.67 percent in 2023, representing a 45 percent reduction over the 43 years surveyed.\nOver time, more countries have shifted to taxing corporations at rates of 30 percent or lower, with the United States following this trend with its tax changes at the end of 2017. The largest shift occurred between 1990 and 2000, with 49 percent of countries imposing a statutory rate below 30 percent in 2000 and only 27 percent of countries in the dataset imposing a statutory rate below 30 percent in 1990. This trend continued between 2000 and 2010, with 79 percent of countries imposing a statutory rate below 30 percent in 2010. Currently, 91 percent of countries impose a statutory rate below 30 percent.[20]\nAll regions saw a net decline in average statutory rates between 1980 and 2023. The average declined the most in Europe, with the 1980 average of 44.6 percent dropping to 19.92 percent—a 55 percent decline. South America has seen the smallest decline, with the average only decreasing by 23 percent, from 36.66 percent in 1980 to 28.38 percent in 2023.\nSouth America saw two periods, 1990-2000 and 2010-2023, during which the average statutory rate increased slightly by less than one percentage point, although the average rate decreased over the full 43-year period.\nConclusion\nWorldwide and regional average top statutory corporate tax rates have declined over the past four decades due to countries turning to more efficient tax types.[21] However, they have leveled off in recent years. Of the 225 jurisdictions around the world, only six have increased their top corporate income tax rate in 2023, a trend that might be reversed in the coming years as more countries agree to implement the global minimum tax.\nCompare All 2023 Corporate Tax Rates\nTable 6: Statutory Top Corporate Tax Rates around the World, 2023\n| ISO3 | Country | Continent | Corporate Tax Rate

corporate income tax rates are from OECD, “Table II.1.

Tax rates were researched only for jurisdictions that are among the around 250 sovereign states and dependent territories that have been assigned a country code by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). As a result, zones or territories that are independent taxing jurisdictions but do not have their own country code are generally not included in the dataset.\nIn addition, the dataset includes historic statutory corporate income tax rates from 1980 to 2022. However, these years cover tax rates of fewer than 225 jurisdictions due to missing data points. Please let Tax Foundation know if you are aware of any sources for historic corporate tax rates that are not mentioned in this report, as we constantly strive to improve our datasets.\nTo be able to calculate average statutory corporate income tax rates weighted by GDP, the dataset includes GDP data for 181 jurisdictions. When used to calculate average statutory corporate income tax rates, either weighted by GDP or unweighted, only these 181 jurisdictions are included (to ensure the comparability of the unweighted and weighted averages).\nDefinition of Selected Corporate Income Tax Rate\nThe dataset captures standard top statutory corporate income tax rates levied on domestic businesses. This means:\n- The dataset does not reflect special tax regimes, including but not limited to patent boxes, offshore regimes, or special rates for specific industries.\n- A number of countries levy lower rates for businesses below a certain revenue threshold. The dataset does not capture these lower rates.\n- A few countries levy gross revenue taxes on businesses instead of corporate income taxes. Since the tax rates of a corporate income tax and a gross revenue tax are not comparable, these countries are excluded from the dataset.\n- Some countries have a separate tax rate for nonresident companies. This dataset does not consider nonresident tax rates that differ from the general corporate rate.\nSources\nTax Rates for the Year 2023\nFor OECD and non-OECD countries, the statutory corporate income tax rates used are the combined corporate income tax rates provided by the OECD; see OECD, “Table II.1. Statutory corporate income tax rate,” updated April 2023, https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=Table_II1 and “Statutory Corporate Income Tax Rates,” updated November 2023, https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=CTS_CIT. Another source used for non-OECD jurisdictions is the statutory rates provided by PwC, “Worldwide Tax Summaries – Corporate Taxes,” 2023, https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/. The study also relies on Bloomberg Tax, “Country Guides – Corporate Tax Rates,” accessed in November 2023, https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/tax/toc_view_menu/3380. Jurisdictions that are not part of these sources were researched individually. The source for each of these jurisdictions is listed in a GitHub repository; see Tax Foundation, “worldwide-corporate-tax-rates,” GitHub, https://github.com/TaxFoundation/worldwide-corporate-tax-rates.\nTax Rates for the Years 1980-2022\nTax rates for the time frame between 1980 and 2022 are taken from a dataset compiled by the Tax Foundation over the last few years. These historic rates come from multiple sources: PwC, “Worldwide Tax Summaries – Corporate Taxes,” 2010-2022; KPMG, “Corporate Tax Rate Survey,” 1998- 2003; KPMG, “Corporate tax rates table,” 2003-2019; EY, “Worldwide Corporate Tax Guide,” 2004-2019; OECD, “Historical Table II.1 – Statutory corporate income tax rate,” 1999, http://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/tax-database.htm#C_CorporateCaptial; the University of Michigan – Ross School of Business, “World Tax Database,” https://www.bus.umich.edu/otpr/otpr/default.asp; and numerous government websites.\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) for the years 1980-2023\nGDP calculations are from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, “International Macroeconomics Data Set- Historical and projected real gross domestic product (GDP) and growth rates of GDP for baseline countries/regions (in billions of 2015 dollars) 1970-2033,” August 3, 2022, https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/international-macroeconomic-data-set/.\nReferences\n[1] Unless otherwise noted, calculated averages of statutory corporate income tax rates only include jurisdictions for which GDP data is available for all years between 1980 and 2023. For 2023, the dataset includes statutory corporate income tax rates of 225 jurisdictions, but GDP data is available for only 181 of these jurisdictions, reducing the number of jurisdictions included in calculated averages to 181. For years prior to 2023, the number of countries included in calculated averages varies by year due to missing corporate tax rates; that is, the 1980 average includes statutory corporate income tax rates of 75 jurisdictions, compared to 181 jurisdictions in 2023.\n[2] Statutory corporate income tax rates are from OECD, “Table II.1.

{"custom_id": "4_extracted-10672.json", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/chat/completions", "body": {"model": "gpt-5", "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an expert in detecting and analyzing fake news. Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context. Assign the appropriate credibility rating based on the scale above, and provide a clear justification using facts and evidence.\n\n    Output format (json):\n    You must respond with a single json object.

After noting characteristics of the incarcerated and some causes of incarceration, it assesses a recent policy response, the First Step Act.\nWho is being incarcerated?\nDrug Offenders\nOf the 2.2 million currently being held in the U.S. criminal justice system, nearly 500,000 people are being held for drug offenses, the majority of whom were arrested for simple possession, a non-violent crime.[8] These individuals account for roughly one-fifth of all people held and 44 percent of those held in federal facilities.[9]\nOf the 226,000 people in federal prisons and jails, 78,000 (47 percent of the convicted population) are serving time for drug offenses and 22,000 are being held by U.S. Marshalls for drug charges but have not yet been convicted.[10] Of the nearly 1.3 million individuals in state prisons, 191,000 (14.8 percent) are serving time for drug-related offenses.[11] Of the 631,000 held in local jails, 37,000 have been convicted of a drug offense, and 120,000 individuals, representing 25.5 percent of non-convicted individuals, are being held pre-trial for a drug charge.[12]\nPre-trial Detainees\nOne-fourth of all those incarcerated in the United States (555,000 people) are being held pre-trial, primarily because they cannot afford to pay bail.[13] Most states require people to pay a cash bail in order to be released from jail while they await their turn in court. Across the country, there are nearly three times as many people being held by local jails who have not been convicted of a crime (470,000) as have (161,000).[14] Nearly three-fourths of individuals held pre-trial have been accused of low-level drug or property crimes or other non-violent crimes.[15]\nAfter accounting for the significant overlap between these two populations, they represent nearly two-fifths (38 percent) of the 2.2 million people currently incarcerated in the United States.\nHomelessness\nOthers are imprisoned indirectly for their poverty, such as violations related to homelessness. A study from the National Law Center of Homelessness and Poverty examining laws related to homelessness in 187 cities across the United States reveals a significant increase in laws criminalizing various behaviors relating to homelessness, such as bans on sleeping, sitting, or lying down in public; sleeping in your vehicle; begging; and loitering. Nine percent of cities have even outlawed sharing food with homeless people.[16] All of these laws make it quite difficult to be homeless and not break the law, creating a vicious cycle: Homelessness makes an individual 11 times more likely to be incarcerated, and being incarcerated makes a person 10 times more likely to be homeless.[17] More than one-fourth of all homeless individuals reported being arrested for activities related to homelessness.[18] With more than 552,000 people estimated to be homeless in the United States, that proportion amounts to 143,000 being arrested for homelessness.[19]\nFailure to Pay Child Support\nEvery state, as well as the federal government, has laws criminalizing failure to pay child support. Evidence shows that compliance with child support orders increases as wages increase;[20] in 2007, 70 percent of child support debt was owed by individuals with annual income of $10,000 or less.[21] This figure suggests that failure to pay is not primarily because of a refusal but rather an inability. Because many states set obligations based on assumed or expected earnings, rather than actual earnings, the median order for obligors with annual incomes lower than $10,000 was 83 percent of their reported income in child support.[22] In 14 states, not only can people be imprisoned for failing to pay child support, but the obligations are not paused while one is in prison and unable to earn income. As a result, in 2007, the average person imprisoned for failure to pay entered prison with a debt of $10,000 and left with a debt of $20,000 and no greater ability to pay while the state incurred costs for imprisonment.[23] Nonpayment of child support was estimated in 2016 to account for the incarceration of 50,000 people.[24]\nInability to Pay Fines\nAnother significant share of the incarcerated population consists of individuals who have been arrested for a failure to pay debts or fines owed for minor infractions. Many legal infractions are punished through the imposition of fines. Courts also require defendants, guilty or not, to pay fees for myriad necessary services, such as court clerk fees, filing fees, DNA database fees, jury fees, crime lab fees, and late fees. Forty-three states require defendants to pay for their court-appointed lawyer, sometimes even when the accused is found not guilty.[25] At least 41 states charge “room-and-board” for time in prison, and every state, excluding Washington, D.C., requires wearers of home monitoring devices to pay for their use.[26] Failure to pay these fines—or rather, failure to comply with a court order—can result in imprisonment, despite the fact that imprisoning an individual for inability to pay has been ruled unconstitutional.\nAccording to the Brennan Center, nearly every state has increased the use and amount of fees and fines since 2008, largely as a means of raising revenue.[27] Another study from the Urban Institute shows how the share of charges as a source of state and local revenue has increased while sales taxes and property taxes have declined and income taxes have held relatively steady.[28] Nearly half of local governments now receive more than 20 percent of their revenue through the imposition of fines and court costs.[29] In 2010, 10 million people across the United States owed a collective $50 billion in fees, fines, and charges to the criminal justice system.[30] It is unknown how many of these individuals are being imprisoned for their debts.\nWhile the populations arrested for activities indirectly related to poverty—homelessness, inability to pay child support, and non-payment of debts and fines—are harder to quantify, it is clear they represent a significant share of the incarcerated population, possibly up to 10 percent. These estimates show that non-violent drug offenders and people arrested or held indirectly for their poverty account for nearly half of the incarcerated population in the United States.\nPoverty and Overcriminalization\nThe root causes of mass incarceration are poverty and overcriminalization.\nWhile it is difficult to ascertain whether poverty makes someone more likely to commit a crime, data show it does make a person more susceptible to being arrested and more likely to be charged with a harsher crime and to receive a longer sentence. Adults in poverty are three times more likely to be arrested than those who aren’t, and people earning less than 150 percent of the federal poverty level are 15 times more likely to be charged with a felony—which, by definition, carries a longer sentence—than people earning above that threshold.[31] Between 1999 and 2016, people convicted of a crime with at least some college education were given sentences that were between 4.6 and 7.8 percent shorter than individuals without college education.[32] Given that one’s education level is highly correlated with a person’s income, this statistic, too, suggests that longer sentences are imposed on lower-income individuals. All of this results in the share of the imprisoned population that was in poverty prior to being arrested equaling 57 percent for men and 72 percent for women, despite a national poverty rate of 11.8 percent.[33], [34]\nThe Brookings Institution found that only 49 percent of incarcerated men were employed in the three years prior to incarceration and their median annual earnings were $6,250; just 13 percent earned more than $15,000.[35] Further findings in the Brookings study reveal a pattern: These individuals are not just more likely to be poor and unemployed, but they were also more likely to grow up in poverty and in neighborhoods with high unemployment. The likelihood that a boy from a family in the bottom 10 percent of the income distribution will end up in prison in his thirties is 20 times greater than that of a boy from a family in the top 10 percent.[36] Individuals are also nearly twice as likely to be imprisoned if they grow up in single-parent homes, even after accounting for differences in income.[37] Children who grow up in poverty are more likely to have developmental issues, which inhibit impulse control, cause low self-esteem, and reduce educational achievements, each of which may contribute to the likelihood of committing a crime.[38]\nThe High Price of Cash Bail\nThe use of cash bail continues to grow, despite findings that its increased use correlates with higher rates of failure to appear, rather than lower, and no evidence that it increases community safety.[39] The median bail amount as of 2013 was $11,700; adjusting for inflation yields a median bail amount of more than $12,800 in 2020 dollars.[40] As detailed by the Hamilton Project, cash bail use and amounts have been increasing over the past several decades.[41] Among non-violent felony drug offenders, approximately 75 percent faced bail of $5,000 or more, as of 2009; an estimated 58 percent faced bail of at least $10,000.[42] Among non-violent felony property offenders in 2009, an estimated 63 percent faced bail of $5,000 or more, and nearly 50 percent faced bail of at least $10,000.[43]\nMost people in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution would not have enough assets to pay even the bail bond premium for the median bail—typically 10 percent of the bail amount and non-refundable—let alone the bail itself.[44] The median income of an individual in jail unable to meet bail, prior to their incarceration, is estimated at $16,233 in 2020 dollars, after adjusting the 2015 estimate for inflation; 37 percent had income less than $9,500.[45] In 2015, the median income of such an individual was 61 percent less for men and 51 percent less for women than the median income of their non-incarcerated peers; these differences are even greater for non-White individuals.[46] A study found that the likelihood of being assigned bail was 3.6 percentage points greater for Black defendants compared with Whites, and that their average bail amount is $10,000 higher.[47]\nPoverty and Substance Use\nIn 2017, 19.7 million Americans (over the age of 12) battled a substance use disorder.[48]\nPoverty and drug use perpetuate each other and often inhibit escape from the cycles of addiction and poverty; substance abuse may result from poverty as a person uses drugs or alcohol as a way to cope with their financial stresses, and alternatively, poverty can be a result of chronic and expensive drug abuse that leads to overwhelming debt.[49] In 2016, drug and alcohol use cost an estimated $1.45 trillion, including $578 billion in economic loss and $874 billion in societal harm from reduced quality of life.[50]\nAccording to data from the National Household Survey of Drug Abuse (NHSDA) and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, drug use is associated with greater poverty because of its effects on education level, human capital investments, and family composition.[51] Drug use, particularly chronic drug use, lowers productivity, reduces earnings, adversely affects educational attainment, and ultimately increases the likelihood of poverty.[52] Furthermore, labor market outcomes and household income levels are significantly affected by family composition and the quantity of income sources. Patterns of drug use are established at relatively early ages, prior to most investments in human capital and education—according to the NHSDA, among those who reported marijuana use, 75 percent first used marijuana by age 18, and among those who reported cocaine use, 50 percent first used cocaine by age 19.[53]\nThe cyclical nature of addiction and poverty is evident through the following statistics. In 2012, almost twice as many people who were unemployed struggled with addiction compared to full time workers (17 percent of unemployed vs. 9 percent of full-time workers).[54] In 2013, around 20 percent of people on welfare reported using illicit drugs in the previous year.[55] According to research from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, nearly 35 percent of sheltered homeless adults in 2010 had chronic substance use issues—likely a severe underestimate of the overall impact of substance abuse, as it is does not include the unsheltered homeless population.[56] Of jail inmates who were homeless in the year prior to incarceration, 79 percent showed symptoms indicating drug or alcohol use or dependence.[57]\nRecovery from drug use is also less likely for those in poverty: An individual who makes $20,000 is one-third less likely to recover from a cocaine addiction than someone who makes over $70,000 a year.[58] According to the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the lack of financial resources or insurance was the most commonly reported reason for not receiving treatment: 37 percent of Americans age 12 or older who did not receive treatment for addiction did so because they did not have health insurance or could not afford rehab.[59]\nAccounting for Race: Racial Disparities in Arrest and Sentencing Rates\nPoverty does not tell the whole story of mass incarceration. Because of who is most likely to be poor in the United States, poverty and its connections to incarceration lead to disparate impacts on minority populations. The data show, however, that even after accounting for poverty, racial disparities in incarceration rates persist.\nOf people in prison for drug offenses, nearly 80 percent in federal prison and 60 percent in state prisons are Black or Latino, despite historical data showing that, on average, Whites are just as, if not more, likely to use illicit drugs.[60] Further, users are more likely to purchase drugs from someone of the same race.[61] Thus, the population imprisoned for drug offenses should reflect roughly the racial composition of the general population—or even skew slightly more White—if people of all races were arrested, charged, prosecuted, and sentenced equally.[62] The data show this is not the case.\nRegarding marijuana specifically, Black use was 30 percent greater than Whites in 2010, but Black individuals were arrested 270 percent more often than Whites. Black offenders were also nearly twice as likely as White offenders to be charged by a federal prosecutor for an offense that carried a mandatory minimum sentence.[63] This disparity in charges was found to account for at least half of the study’s noted 10 percent difference in sentence length between White and Black individuals.[64]\nAccording to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, however, the sentence-gap is nearly twice that: Overall, Black males receive sentences 19.1 percent longer than similarly situated White males, on average. Further, Black males were 21.2 percent less likely than White males to receive a sentence shorter than what sentencing guidelines suggest or typically require.[65]\nIncome Inequality\nFurther, while poverty certainly plays a role in the level of crime in a community, income inequality is actually a better predictor of crime rates: Numerous studies have shown that the greater the inequality, the more crime there will likely be in an area. One study examining U.S. cities found that differences in income inequality alone explained 74 percent of the variance in murder rates and 50 percent of the difference in aggravated assaults.[66] In fact, during the Great Depression, as well as the major recessions in 1893, 1907, and 2009 that brought increased poverty but decreased income inequality, crime rates either dropped or remained flat.[67] Another study of three U.S. cities similarly found that when income inequality increased between neighborhoods, so too did the level of property crime, but the poorest areas experienced the least property crime.[68]\nThe Impact of the First Step Act of 2018\nThe First Step Act (FSA) was a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill that aimed to reduce the size of the federal prison population and improve criminal justice outcomes. Since it became law in December 2018, significant progress has been made to reduce sentence lengths and to release individuals who have already served significant time.\nThe FSA addresses outdated sentencing laws, and, most notably, it shortened mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses.[69] The FSA also retroactively applied the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010—which was originally introduced to reduce the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine thresholds for mandatory minimum sentences known to hurt racial minorities—resulting in over 3,000 sentence reductions and over 2,000 inmate releases as of May 22, 2020.[70] In July 2019, the Department of Justice released 3,100 prisoners from the Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) custody as a result of good conduct under the FSA.[71] The FSA has also allowed for the approval of over 2,000 requests for inmate transfers to a facility closer to the intended city of release.[72]\nThe FSA authorized the use of home confinement for low-risk, chronically ill, and elderly offenders, and since its 2018 implementation, over 1,000 prisoners have qualified.[73] The passage of the CARES Act expanded home confinement programs in emergency cases and placed an additional 3,000 inmates on home confinement, in hopes of lessening the risk of exposure to the coronavirus in prisons.[74]\nIn addition to early releases and shortened sentences, the FSA requires the BOP to help inmates apply for federal and state benefits, as well as obtain identification in the form of a social security card or driver’s license.[75] The FSA also reauthorized the Second Chance Act of 2007, which developed guidelines for recidivism-reducing partnerships between prisons and nonprofit organizations, as well as introduced a competitive grant program to provide such services.[76]\nUltimately, the First Step Act is helping to address mass incarceration in the United States and shows that bipartisan criminal justice reform is possible. More remains to be done, however.\nConclusion\nThe United States is currently imprisoning roughly 1 million people for low-level drug offenses, property crimes, and various offenses indirectly related to their poverty. Roughly half a million people are imprisoned because of their inability to pay for their release. An estimated 10 million people owe $50 billion in legal fees, fines, and penalties. The use of cash bail and monetary penalties punishes people for their poverty, disproportionately impacts racial and ethnic minorities, and fails to provide a deterrent. Future policy solutions should work to alleviate poverty and unemployment and to impose non-monetary punishments for low-income offenders when appropriate. Without reducing poverty and income inequality, racial bias, and the overcriminalization of activities related to poverty, the United States will not meaningfully reduce its prison population.\n[1] https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?tid=11&ty=tp\n[2] https://www.nap.edu/read/18613/chapter/4\n[3] https://www.prisonpolicy.org/global/2018.html\n[4] https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/10/17/facts-about-crime-in-the-u-s/\n[5] https://www.nap.edu/read/18613/chapter/4#47\n[6] https://apps.urban.org/features/long-prison-terms/trends.html\n[7] https://www.sentencingproject.org/criminal-justice-facts/\n[8] https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html\n[9] https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html\n[10] https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html\n[11] https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html\n[12] https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html\n[13] https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html\n[14] https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/incomejails.html\n[15] https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html\n[16] https://nlchp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/No_Safe_Place.pdf\n[17] https://www.texascjc.org/system/files/publications/Return%20to%20Nowhere%20The%20Revolving%20Door%20Between%20Incarceration%20and%20Homelessness.pdf\n[18] https://nlchp.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/No_Safe_Place.pdf\n[19] https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/The-State-of-Homelessness-in-America.pdf\n[20] https://ywcss.com/sites/default/files/pdf-resource/how_do_child_support_orders_affect_payments_and_compliance.pdf\n[21] https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/29736/1001242-Assessing-Child-Support-Arrears-in-Nine-Large-States-and-the-Nation.PDF\n[22] https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/29736/1001242-Assessing-Child-Support-Arrears-in-Nine-Large-States-and-the-Nation.PDF\n[23] https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/29736/1001242-Assessing-Child-Support-Arrears-in-Nine-Large-States-and-the-Nation.PDF\n[24] https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2016/sep/2/poor-parents-fail-pay-child-support-go-jail/\n[25] https://www.npr.org/2014/05/19/312158516/increasing-court-fees-punish-the-poor\n[26] https://www.npr.org/2014/05/19/312158516/increasing-court-fees-punish-the-poor\n[27] https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/steep-costs-criminal-justice-fees-and-fines\n[28] https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-and-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/state-and-local-revenues\n[29] https://www.governing.com/gov-data/other/local-governments-high-fine-revenues-by-state.html\n[30] https://jjrec.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/debtpenalty.pdf\n[31] https://www.texascjc.org/system/files/publications/Return%20to%20Nowhere%20The%20Revolving%20Door%20Between%20Incarceration%20and%20Homelessness.pdf\n[32] https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-publications/2017/20171114_Demographics.pdf\n[33] https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/income.html\n[34] https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-266.html\n[35] https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/es_20180314_looneyincarceration_final.pdf\n[36] https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/es_20180314_looneyincarceration_final.pdf\n[37] https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/es_20180314_looneyincarceration_final.pdf\n[38] https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5156/99b3bacf2a82ff98522675ccb3ec0ea16d6d.pdf\n[39] http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/bailfail.pdf\n[40] https://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/files/BailFineReform_EA_121818_6PM.pdf\n[41] https://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/files/BailFineReform_EA_121818_6PM.pdf\n[42] https://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/files/BailFineReform_EA_121818_6PM.pdf\n[43] https://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/files/BailFineReform_EA_121818_6PM.pdf\n[44] https://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/files/BailFineReform_EA_121818_6PM.pdf\n[45] https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/incomejails.html\n[46] https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/incomejails.html\n[47] Arnold, David, Will Dobbie, and Crystal S.

Governments typically use fiscal policy to promote strong and sustainable growth and reduce poverty. The role and objectives of fiscal policy gained prominence during the recent global economic crisis, when governments stepped in to support financial systems, jump-start growth, and mitigate the impact of the crisis on vulnerable groups. In the communiqué following their London summit in April 2009, leaders of the Group of 20 industrial and emerging market countries stated that they were undertaking “unprecedented and concerted fiscal expansion.” What did they mean by fiscal expansion? And, more generally, how can fiscal tools provide a boost to the world economy?\nHistorically, the prominence of fiscal policy as a policy tool has waxed and waned. Before 1930, an approach of limited government, or laissez-faire, prevailed. With the stock market crash and the Great Depression, policymakers pushed for governments to play a more proactive role in the economy. More recently, countries had scaled back the size and function of government—with markets taking on an enhanced role in the allocation of goods and services—but when the global financial crisis threatened worldwide recession, many countries returned to a more active fiscal policy.\nHow does fiscal policy work?\nWhen policymakers seek to influence the economy, they have two main tools at their disposal—monetary policy and fiscal policy. Central banks indirectly target activity by influencing the money supply through adjustments to interest rates, bank reserve requirements, and the purchase and sale of government securities and foreign exchange. Governments influence the economy by changing the level and types of taxes, the extent and composition of spending, and the degree and form of borrowing.\nGovernments directly and indirectly influence the way resources are used in the economy. A basic equation of national income accounting that measures the output of an economy—or gross domestic product (GDP)—according to expenditures helps show how this happens:\nGDP = C + I + G + NX.\nOn the left side is GDP—the value of all final goods and services produced in the economy. On the right side are the sources of aggregate spending or demand—private consumption (C), private investment (I), purchases of goods and services by the government (G), and exports minus imports (net exports, NX). This equation makes it evident that governments affect economic activity (GDP), controlling G directly and influencing C, I, and NXindirectly, through changes in taxes, transfers, and spending. Fiscal policy that increases aggregate demand directly through an increase in government spending is typically called expansionary or “loose.” By contrast, fiscal policy is often considered contractionary or “tight” if it reduces demand via lower spending.\nBesides providing goods and services like public safety, highways, or primary education, fiscal policy objectives vary. In the short term, governments may focus on macroeconomic stabilization—for example, expanding spending or cutting taxes to stimulate an ailing economy, or slashing spending or raising taxes to combat rising inflation or to help reduce external vulnerabilities. In the longer term, the aim may be to foster sustainable growth or reduce poverty with actions on the supply side to improve infrastructure or education. Although these objectives are broadly shared across countries, their relative importance differs, depending on country circumstances. In the short term, priorities may reflect the business cycle or response to a natural disaster or a spike in global food or fuel prices. In the longer term, the drivers can be development levels, demographics, or natural resource endowments. The desire to reduce poverty might lead a low-income country to tilt spending toward primary health care, whereas in an advanced economy, pension reforms might target looming long-term costs related to an aging population. In an oil-producing country, policymakers might aim to better align fiscal policy with broader macroeconomic developments by moderating procyclical spending—both by limiting bursts of spending when oil prices rise and by refraining from painful cuts when they drop.\nResponse to the global crisis\nThe global crisis that had its roots in the 2007 meltdown in the U.S. mortgage market is a good case study in fiscal policy. The crisis hurt economies around the globe, with financial sector difficulties and flagging confidence hitting private consumption, investment, and international trade (all of which affect output, GDP). Governments responded by trying to boost activity through two channels: automatic stabilizers and fiscal stimulus—that is, new discretionary spending or tax cuts. Stabilizers go into effect as tax revenues and expenditure levels change and do not depend on specific actions by the government. They operate in relation to the business cycle. For instance, as output slows or falls, the amount of taxes collected declines because corporate profits and taxpayers’ incomes fall, particularly under progressive tax structures where higher-income earners fall into higher-tax-rate brackets. Unemployment benefits and other social spending are also designed to rise during a downturn. These cyclical changes make fiscal policy automatically expansionary during downturns and contractionary during upturns.\nAutomatic stabilizers are linked to the size of the government, and tend to be larger in advanced economies. Where stabilizers are larger, there may be less need for stimulus—tax cuts, subsidies, or public works programs—since both approaches help to soften the effects of a downturn. Indeed, during the recent crisis, countries with larger stabilizers tended to resort less to discretionary measures. In addition, although discretionary measures can be tailored to stabilization needs, automatic stabilizers are not subject to implementation lags as discretionary measures often are. (It can take time, for example, to design, get approval for, and implement new road projects.) Moreover, automatic stabilizers—and their effects—are automatically withdrawn as conditions improve.\nStimulus may be difficult to design and implement effectively and difficult to reverse when conditions pick up. In many low-income and emerging market countries, however, institutional limitations and narrow tax bases mean stabilizers are relatively weak. Even in countries with larger stabilizers, there may be a pressing need to compensate for the loss of economic activity and compelling reasons to target the government’s crisis response to those most directly in need.\nFiscal ability to respond\nThe exact response ultimately depends on the fiscal space a government has available for new spending initiatives or tax cuts—that is, its access to additional financing at a reasonable cost or its ability to reorder its existing expenditures. Some governments were not in a position to respond with stimulus, because their potential creditors believed additional spending and borrowing would put too much pressure on inflation, foreign exchange reserves, or the exchange rate—or delay recovery by taking too many resources from the local private sector (also known as crowding out). Creditors may also have doubted some governments’ ability to spend wisely, to reverse stimulus once put in place, or to address long-standing concerns with underlying structural weaknesses in public finances (such as chronically low tax revenues due to a poor tax structure or evasion, weak control over the finances of local governments or state-owned enterprises, or rising health costs and aging populations). For other governments, more severe financing constraints have necessitated spending cuts as revenues decline (stabilizers functioning). In countries with high inflation or external current account deficits, fiscal stimulus is likely to be ineffective, and even undesirable.\nThe size, timing, composition, and duration of stimulus matter. Policymakers generally aim to tailor the size of stimulus measures to their estimates of the size of the output gap—the difference between expected output and what output would be if the economy were functioning at full capacity. A measure of the effectiveness of the stimulus—or, more precisely, how it affects the growth of output (also known as the multiplier)—is also needed. Multipliers tend to be larger if there is less leakage (for example, only a small part of the stimulus is saved or spent on imports), monetary conditions are accommodative (interest rates do not rise as a consequence of the fiscal expansion and thereby counter its effects), and the country’s fiscal position after the stimulus is viewed as sustainable. Multipliers can be small or even negative if the expansion raises concerns about sustainability in the period immediately ahead or in the longer term, in which case the private sector would likely counteract government intervention by increasing savings or even moving money offshore, rather than investing or consuming. Multipliers also tend to be higher for spending measures than for tax cuts or transfers and lower for small, open economies (in both cases, because of the extent of leakages). As for composition, governments face a trade-off in deciding between targeting stimulus to the poor, where the likelihood of full spending and a strong economic effect is higher; funding capital investments, which may create jobs and help bolster longer-term growth; or providing tax cuts that may encourage firms to take on more workers or buy new capital equipment. In practice, governments have taken a “balanced” approach with measures in all of these areas.\nAs for timing, it often takes awhile to implement spending measures (program or project design, procurement, execution), and once in place, the measures may be in effect longer than needed. However, if the downturn is expected to be prolonged (as was the recent crisis), concerns over lags may be less pressing: some governments stressed the implementation of “shovel-ready” projects that were already vetted and ready to go. For all these reasons, stimulus measures should be timely, targeted, and temporary—quickly reversed once conditions improve.\nSimilarly, the responsiveness and scope of stabilizers can be enhanced—for instance, by a more progressive tax system that taxes high-income households at a higher rate than lower-income households. Transfer payments can also be explicitly linked to economic conditions (for instance, unemployment rates or other labor market triggers). In some countries, fiscal rules aim to limit the growth of spending during boom times, when revenue growth—particularly from natural resources—is high and constraints seem less binding. Elsewhere, formal review or expiration (“sunset”) mechanisms for programs help to ensure that new initiatives do not outlive their initial purpose. Finally, medium-term frameworks with comprehensive coverage and assessment of revenues, expenditures, assets and liabilities, and risks help improve policymaking over the business cycle.\nBig deficits and rising public debt\nFiscal deficits and public debt ratios (the ratio of debt to GDP) have expanded sharply in many countries because of the effects of the crisis on GDP and tax revenues as well as the cost of the fiscal response to the crisis. Support and guarantees to financial and industrial sectors have added to concerns about the financial health of governments. Many countries can afford to run moderate fiscal deficits for extended periods, with domestic and international financial markets and international and bilateral partners convinced of their ability to meet present and future obligations. Deficits that grow too large and linger too long may, however, undermine that confidence. Aware of these risks in the present crisis, the IMF in late 2008 and early 2009 called on governments to establish a four-pronged fiscal policy strategy to help ensure solvency: stimulus should not have permanent effects on deficits; medium-term frameworks should include commitment to fiscal correction once conditions improve; structural reforms should be identified and implemented to enhance growth; and countries facing medium- and long-term demographic pressures should firmly commit to clear strategies for health care and pension reform. Even as the worse effects of the crisis recede, fiscal challenges remain significant, particularly in advanced economies in Europe and North America and this strategy remains as valid as ever.\nOpinions expressed in articles and other materials are those of the authors; they do not necessarily reflect IMF policy.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        What is the national debt?\nThe national debt is the total amount of outstanding borrowing by the U.S. Federal Government accumulated over the nation’s history.\nKey Takeaways\nThe national debt is composed of distinct types of debt, similar to an individual whose debt may consist of a mortgage, car loan, and credit cards. The different types of debt include non-marketable or marketable securities and whether it is debt held by the public or debt held by the government itself (known as intragovernmental).\nThe U.S. has carried debt since its inception. Debts incurred during the American Revolutionary War amounted to $75 million, primarily borrowed from domestic investors and the French Government for war materials.\nThe national debt enables the federal government to pay for important programs and services for the American public.\nThe National Debt Explained\n| Revenue | Spending | Deficit | ||\n| Year 1 | $400 | $500 | -$100 | |\n| Year 2 | $600 | $800 | -$200 | |\n| -$300 | Debt | |||\nFunding Programs & Services\nThe federal government needs to borrow money to pay its bills when its ongoing spending activities and investments cannot be funded by federal revenues alone. Decreases in federal revenue are largely due to either a decrease in tax rates or individuals or corporations making less money. The national debt enables the federal government to pay for important programs and services even if it does not have funds immediately available, often due to a decrease in revenue. Decreases in federal revenue coupled with increased government spending further increases the deficit.\nConsistent with the purpose of the federal government established by the U.S. Constitution, money is spent on programs and services to ensure the well-being of U.S. residents. The Constitution’s preamble states that the purpose of the federal government is “…to establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.” Uninterrupted funding of programs and services is critical to residents’ health, welfare, and security.\nIn accordance with the 2014 DATA Act, federal agencies are required to submit financial data on a quarterly and/or monthly basis to USAspending.gov. Anyone can visit USAspending for a breakdown of what the federal government spends each year and how it spends that money. Visitors can follow the money from the Congressional appropriations to the federal agencies and down to local communities and businesses.\nThe Growing National Debt\nThe U.S. has carried debt since its inception. Debts incurred during the American Revolutionary War amounted to over $75 million by January 1, 1791. Over the next 45 years, the debt continued to grow until 1835 when it notably shrank due to the sale of federally-owned lands and cuts to the federal budget. Shortly thereafter, an economic depression caused the debt to again grow into the millions. The debt grew over 4,000% through the course of the American Civil War, increasing from $65 million in 1860 to $1 billion in 1863 and almost $3 billion shortly after the conclusion of the war in 1865. The debt grew steadily into the 20th century and was roughly $22 billion after the country financed its involvement in World War I.\nNotable recent events triggering large spikes in the debt include the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, the 2008 Great Recession, and the COVID-19 pandemic. From FY 2019 to FY 2021, spending increased by about 50%, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tax cuts, stimulus programs, increased government spending, and decreased tax revenue caused by widespread unemployment generally account for sharp rises in the national debt.\nComparing a country’s debt to its gross domestic product (GDP) reveals the country’s ability to pay down its debt. This ratio is considered a better indicator of a country’s fiscal situation than just the national debt number because it shows the burden of debt relative to the country’s total economic output and therefore its ability to repay it. The U.S. debt to GDP ratio surpassed 100% in 2013 when both debt and GDP were approximately 16.7 trillion.\nBreaking Down the Debt\nThe national debt is composed of distinct types of debt, similar to an individual whose debt consists of a mortgage, car loan, and credit cards. The national debt can be broken down by whether it is non-marketable or marketable and whether it is debt held by the public or debt held by the government itself (known as intragovernmental). The national debt does not include debts carried by state and local governments, such as debt used to pay state-funded programs; nor does it include debts carried by individuals, such as personal credit card debt or mortgages.\nThe visual below comparing calendar year and displays the difference in growth between debt held by the public and intragovernmental debt. While both types of debt combine to make up the national debt, they have increased by different amounts in the past several years. One of the main causes of the jump in public debt can be attributed to increased funding of programs and services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Intragovernmental debt has not increased by quite as much since it is primarily composed of debt owed on agencies’ excess revenue invested with the Treasury. The revenue of the largest investor in Treasury securities, the Social Security Administration, has not increased significantly in recent years, resulting in this slower intragovernmental holding increase.\nMaintaining the National Debt\nThe federal government is charged interest for the use of lenders’ money, in the same way that lenders charge an individual interest for a car loan or mortgage. How much the government pays in interest depends on the total national debt and the various securities’ interest rates.\nAs of it costs $0 billion to maintain the debt, which is 0% of the total federal spending in fiscal year .\nThe national debt has increased every year over the past ten years. Interest expenses during this period have remained fairly stable due to low interest rates and investors’ judgement that the U.S. Government has a very low risk of default. However, recent increases in interest rates and inflation are now resulting in an increase in interest expense.\nThe Debt Ceiling\nThe debt ceiling, or debt limit, is a restriction imposed by Congress on the amount of outstanding national debt that the federal government can have. The debt ceiling is the amount that the Treasury can borrow to pay the bills that have become due and pay for future investments. Once the debt ceiling is reached, the federal government cannot increase the amount of outstanding debt, losing the ability to pay bills and fund programs and services. However, the Treasury can use extraordinary measures authorized by Congress to temporarily suspend certain intragovernmental debt allowing it to borrow to fund programs or services for a limited amount of time after it has reached the ceiling.\nSince the United States has never defaulted on its obligations, the scope of the negative repercussions related to a default are unknown but would likely have catastrophic repercussions in the United States and in markets across the globe.\nTracking the Debt\nCreated in 2012 and operating under the Department of the Treasury, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service manages all federal payments and collections and provides government-wide accounting and reporting services. A primary function of the Fiscal Service is to account for and report the national debt, as dictated by the U.S. Constitution, which states that “regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.”\nDive Deeper into the Debt\nFor more information about the national debt, please explore more of Fiscal Data and check out the extensive resources listed below.\nhttps://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/static-data/published-reports/frusg/FRUSG_2024.pdf\nhttps://www.gao.gov/americas-fiscal-future/federal-debt\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/publication/56910\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/money_12853.htm\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/publication/56783\nhttps://fiscal.treasury.gov/reports-statements/treasury-bulletin/\nhttps://www.usaspending.gov\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        I. Introduction\nI would like to start by expressing my gratitude to the New York Association for Business Economics for organizing today’s event, and to all of you for being here. It is an honor to receive the William F. Butler Award and to join many distinguished past recipients.\nI note that I am even the second “Janet L.” on the list. The first was Janet L. Norwood, whom I had the pleasure of inducting into the Department of Labor Hall of Honor in 2015 when I was Fed Chair. That Janet served as the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for over a decade, exemplifying the BLS’s reputation for accuracy and integrity and driving improvements in its work and thus in our understanding of the economy. She was responsible, for example, for the launch of the Consumer Expenditure Survey and improvements in the Consumer Price Index, among other innovations.\nI mention this not only to underscore that I am honored to be among prior Award recipients, but also because today I will speak to what has happened in the U.S. economy over the past four years, drawing heavily on key economic data and analytics.\nI will argue that the U.S. economy has done remarkably well in the aftermath of the pandemic. This fact becomes even more apparent when the recovery is placed in the proper context, namely by comparing U.S. economic outcomes to those in other advanced economies, to performance in past recessions, and to what economists forecasted. U.S. outperformance becomes clearer still if one considers an important counterfactual: what likely would have happened under an alternative approach that focused only on inflation and not on unemployment. All policy choices entail tradeoffs, but the Biden Administration made sound decisions that set the economy on a strong course.\nIt’s not my intention to paint an overly rosy picture of Americans’ economic well-being. All too many households have faced growing challenges over decades. These include rising costs of housing and childcare and high debt burdens.[1] Young men in particular have seen their wages stagnate and they’re participating less in the labor force. [2] Such adverse, decades-long trends have left many Americans with the sense that it is difficult to sustain a middle-class life. To address this complex of longer-run structural problems, the Biden Administration has been pursuing a strategy I call modern supply-side economics, an approach that focuses on channeling public and private capital to boost America’s capacity to produce goods and services in an inclusive and sustainable manner.\nUnfortunately, these longer-term challenges cannot be solved overnight. So today, I will also look ahead and emphasize how critical it is for America to sustain recent investments in cutting-edge industries and research and development, while also addressing the significant challenge of fiscal sustainability.\nII. A Historic Economic Recovery\nI’ll begin my evaluation of the recovery by going back four years. President Biden took office at a time of profound fear and uncertainty. Thousands of Americans were dying each day, and the unemployment rate exceeded six percent. America faced the tail risk of an economic crisis that could match that of the Great Depression.\nIn response, the Biden Administration acted quickly and decisively, vaccinating millions to save lives and allow businesses to reopen safely. Pandemic disruptions to supply chains and large sectoral demand shifts led to shortages of many goods and services, pushing up prices. So the Administration worked to unsnarl supply chains by unclogging ports and rapidly increasing the production of some essential goods. These actions helped to restore supply. At the same time, the American Rescue Plan supported demand, including through stimulus checks, monthly child tax credits, and enhanced unemployment insurance. These measures also mitigated hardship and bolstered the financial positions of households and businesses, reducing downside risks.[3] The Administration subsequently navigated additional challenges, including the energy price shock resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a regional banking stress that posed systemic risk, and two debt limit impasses.\nOver time, the supply of goods and services expanded significantly, enabling a combination of strong growth and cooling inflation—namely, a “soft landing.” Supply chains became untangled and the labor force grew, in part due to a significant increase in prime-age labor force participation, which reached historically high levels. Today, economic growth is robust, unemployment remains low, and, after peaking at rates that Americans had not experienced for decades, inflation has now receded to levels that are nearly consistent with the Federal Reserve’s price stability target, although important risks remain.\nThanks to the strength and speed of the overall recovery and the design of the fiscal policies that were implemented, the recovery has also been historically equitable. Unemployment rates fell rapidly, including for Black and Hispanic Americans.[4] The gap between urban and rural unemployment rates narrowed significantly.[5] And, since the onset of the pandemic, real wages have increased for most workers.[6] In 2024, the median American worker could afford the same basket of goods and services as in 2019 with an additional $1,600 left over to spend or save.[7] And it is lower-income workers who have seen the largest gains in real wages.[8] Furthermore, from 2019 to 2022, real median household wealth saw a historic increase to reach its highest-ever level.[9] And it rose more in percentage terms for Black and Hispanic families.[10]\nThe solid recovery in growth and improvement in labor productivity also fueled business dynamism, leading businesses and investors to deploy more capital into the American economy. The number of applications to start new businesses reached record levels,[11] and business sales, adjusted for inflation, expanded by 10 percent above pre-pandemic levels.[12] Small businesses have in fact played a disproportionate role in job creation, contributing more than 70 percent of net private job gains since the fourth quarter of 2019.[13]\nStatistics like these depict the strength of the U.S. economic recovery. But its remarkable nature becomes even more apparent when put in proper context, which is what I will turn to now.\nFirst, consider comparisons to other advanced economies. Virtually all advanced economies experienced a significant spike in inflation. But in the United States, inflation fell earlier than in other G7 economies.[14] At the same time, America enjoyed strong growth. Real GDP now exceeds pre-pandemic levels in all G7 economies. But it grew by more in the United States: by 11.5 percent from the end of 2019 to the third quarter of 2024, followed by 7.3 percent in Canada and 5.6 percent in Italy.[15] This is largely attributable to robust U.S. productivity growth, which far outstripped productivity gains in other G7 economies.[16]\nAt the same time, America quickly achieved and has subsequently maintained a uniquely strong labor market with notable real wage gains. In the period from Q4 of 2019 to Q2 of 2024, the United Kingdom is the only other G7 country that also experienced substantial real wage growth. Real wages grew modestly in Canada, remained essentially unchanged in France, and declined in Germany, Japan, and Italy.[17] The Economist magazine’s mid-October issue perhaps sums it up best, designating the U.S. economy the “envy of the world.”\nComparing this recovery to past ones further underscores the strength of our expansion. While the COVID recession entailed the largest spike in unemployment in living memory, the U.S. unemployment rate declined to its pre-pandemic level in just two years. This contrasts significantly with longer than four years in the 1990, 2001, and 2008 recessions.[18] The historic 37 percent increase in real median household wealth from 2019 to 2022 also stands in marked contrast to the 2007 to 2010 period, when real median household wealth instead fell by 39 percent.[19] And business investment fell less and recovered faster as a share of GDP than in prior recessions, with businesses investing an estimated $625 billion more during this expansion than if investment had followed historical patterns.[20] This historically impressive investment performance reflects domestic and foreign investors’ confidence in the stability and productivity of our economy.\nComparisons to economic forecasts from various points during the past four years also demonstrate the strength of the U.S. recovery. In the fourth quarter of 2021, real GDP exceeded the Blue Chip consensus forecast from October 2020 by more than four percent.[21] The economy then continued performing better than expected. Even in October of 2022, Blue Chip forecasters expected that a recession was more likely than not in 2023, with many prominent forecasters asserting that a recession was a near certainty.[22] As we all know, that recession did not come to pass. In fact, the U.S. economy, remarkably, is expected to be more than 10 percent larger by the end of 2024 than the IMF forecasted in October 2019, before the onset of the pandemic.[23]\nAlongside these three comparisons, we should also consider a counterfactual: how inflation and labor market outcomes would have differed under alternative policy choices. With respect to inflation, it’s true that the prices of many everyday goods soared in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, placing a major strain on many American households. However, as the supply disruptions that drove much of this inflation abated and labor market disruptions subsided, the pace of inflation cooled dramatically. With respect to the labor market, support from the American Rescue Plan substantially offset the income gaps confronting roughly 10 million people[24] who had become unemployed or had left the labor force by the end of 2020. That both averted significant hardship and supported demand, which allowed Americans to get back to work quickly. The rapid decline in unemployment enabled the United States to avoid labor market scarring—the erosion of skills and reduced employability that can result from long periods of unemployment—and thus avoid an associated reduction in future potential output.\nNow, consider the likely consequences of an alternative fiscal response, one solely aimed at preventing the post-pandemic surge in prices without considering the consequences for unemployment. To prevent that inflation surge, fiscal policy would have had to be much tighter. Indeed, a contractionary fiscal policy would likely have been needed to offset the inflationary impact of the pandemic-induced contraction in supply. Such a policy would have withheld critical aid from households and businesses and would likely have led to far lower output and employment. That could have meant millions more people out of work, households without the income to meet their financial obligations, and lackluster consumer spending.\nAn important “what-if” exercise would ask: how much more unemployment would have resulted from a fiscal contraction sufficient to keep inflation at the Fed’s 2 percent target? The answer is “a lot,” although the exact magnitude depends importantly on some key parameter values, particularly the Phillips curve slope, which measures the sensitivity of inflation to a demand-induced contraction in output. Most estimates of the Phillips curve find it to be quite flat. That implies that the employment and output cost of suppressing inflation would have been very substantial. But researchers debate whether such an estimate applied during the pandemic, which was an unusual period characterized by shortages of production capacity in critical sectors and some significant labor market bottlenecks that restrained supply. Some researchers argue for a higher estimate of the Phillips curve slope, and consequently a lower employment and output cost. Such differences notwithstanding, it is widely accepted that some increase in unemployment would have been required to offset the pandemic-induced inflation. Estimates from representative models find that the unemployment rate would have had to rise to 10 to 14 percent to keep inflation at 2 percent throughout 2021 and 2022. That would have meant an additional 9 to 15 million people out of work.[25]\nSuch estimates showcase the critical tradeoff between inflation and jobs that policymakers faced during the pandemic. Strategies designed to fully suppress the post-pandemic inflationary surge would have required an exceptionally, and to my mind an unacceptably, high level of unemployment. The Biden Administration’s fiscal policy choices saved millions of jobs. Even so, inflation fell earlier than in other advanced economies. Over time, supply expanded, helping us achieve a soft landing.\nIII. Looking Forward\nSustaining Productivity-Enhancing Investments\nThe U.S. economy now enjoys solid growth, low inflation, and a strong labor market. But much work is still needed to address the adverse structural trends that make it difficult for so many families to achieve or maintain a middle-class life. Traditional supply-side approaches wrongly assume that policies such as deregulation and tax cuts for the rich will fuel broader economic growth and prosperity. Modern supply-side economics, in contrast, rejects this trickle-down approach. Instead, it aims to expand our economy’s capacity to produce in a manner that is both inclusive and environmentally sound. It seeks to reverse decades-long underinvestment in infrastructure, the labor force, and research and development that have held back productivity growth. And it embraces collaboration between the public and private sectors, including through market-based incentives for critical investments.\nOver the past four years, the Biden Administration, acting on this approach, has made significant investments in infrastructure, R&D, and strategic industries, including semiconductor manufacturing and clean energy. Support to state and local governments during the pandemic has enabled their capital investments as a share of state and local spending to grow more over the past two and a half years than in any period since 1980.[26] This approach is also mobilizing private capital. Since the beginning of the Biden Administration, announced private sector investments in clean energy and manufacturing in the United States have surpassed $1 trillion.[27] Following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act, the pace of factory construction of computer, electronic, and electrical facilities more than doubled, with the increase concentrated in high-tech manufacturing facilities, including those producing semiconductors and electric vehicles.[28] I am glad to have traveled as Treasury Secretary to see these investments firsthand, from a facility producing parts for electric vehicle batteries in Kentucky to a solar cell manufacturing factory in Georgia.\nConsistent with the objectives of modern supply-side economics, such investments are also helping revitalize communities that had not historically benefitted from investment or had been left behind. Almost three-quarters of investments in clean energy since the IRA was passed have been announced in counties with median household incomes below the national average.[29] Eighty-four percent have been announced in counties with college graduation rates below the national average.[30] And Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is disproportionately going to states with lower household incomes.[31]\nThis is a very powerful start, but it is only a start. Economic policymakers must remain focused on driving strong and inclusive long-term growth and addressing climate change, which in turn requires sustaining critical investments in cutting-edge industries, such as the tax credits we have provided to American families and businesses to invest in clean energy. If these incentives are scaled back, it is American communities across the country that will suffer, along with our country’s progress in addressing climate change and in increasing our energy independence in the face of geopolitical risks. We also need to further expand our economy’s capacity to produce through additional supply-side investments, including in housing, childcare, and vocational training.\nAddressing Fiscal Sustainability\nAmerica also needs to ensure that the federal government’s fiscal policy is on a sustainable course. Over the past decade, the federal fiscal outlook has worsened due to significantly higher interest rates and multiple rounds of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Non-defense discretionary spending as a percentage of GDP remains historically low, but government revenues as a share of the economy are significantly lower than expected before the prior Administration’s tax cuts.[32] As a result, the 2024 fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP, at 6.4 percent,[33] is historically high in an economy operating near full employment. And in the decades to come, increased non-discretionary spending for our aging population is poised to put further upward pressure on the deficit.\nThe projected fiscal path under current budgetary policies is simply not sustainable, and the consequences of inaction, or action that exacerbates projected deficits, could be dire. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that extending the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that are scheduled to sunset next year would add around $4 trillion to deficits through 2034.[34] And new Treasury analysis estimates that extending these provisions and reversing additional business raisers enacted in the TCJA, as some have called for, would cost more than $5 trillion through 2035.[35] Such policies could undermine our country’s strength, from the resilience of the Treasury market to the value of the dollar, even provoking a debt crisis in the future. And such misguided economic policymaking would not just affect the economy over the next few years or the next decade. Rather, the burden would fall heavily on the next generation, saddling them with high tax rates and reduced services.\nTo stabilize our fiscal path, President Biden signed deficit reduction laws, particularly the Inflation Reduction Act and the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, that achieved roughly $1 trillion in savings over the next decade.[36] The Administration’s 2025 Budget proposes roughly $3 trillion of additional deficit reduction over the next decade by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share and calls for paying for the extension of tax cuts for those making less than $400,000.[37] Regrettably, Congress failed to act on these proposals.\nAs we look ahead, the government must give more weight to fiscal sustainability concerns when determining both tax and spending priorities. Long-term interest rates are not within the government’s control, but the current, higher interest rate environment necessitates lower primary budget deficits than in the past to ensure fiscal sustainability. This does not mean that critical supply-side investments should be curtailed: given their significant returns, these investments pose little threat to long-term fiscal sustainability. Rather, they are necessary to keep our country on a favorable growth path.\nAnd no country can claim to be serious about fiscal sustainability if it does not invest in a functioning tax collection agency. Achieving fiscal sustainability will require that the government raise additional revenue. The simplest way to boost revenues is by giving the Internal Revenue Service the resources it needs to enforce existing tax law. It is currently estimated that the tax gap—the amount by which actual tax collections fall short of those that are due—stands at more than $7 trillion over the next decade.[38] Adequate funding for the IRS can reduce that gap by ensuring that the wealthiest individuals, large corporations, and complex partnerships pay the taxes they owe under current tax law.\nSuch investments in enforcement more than pay for themselves. Treasury and IRS analysis shows that current investments in technology, data, and high-end enforcement, if extended as our Administration has proposed, could generate $851 billion in additional revenue over the next decade.[39] Such investments also enhance fairness. Small businesses are losing out to big corporations that can avoid paying their tax bills. These businesses deserve a level playing field.\nIV. Conclusion\nAmerica is faced with exceptional challenges in the years ahead. These include climate change, the possibility of future pandemics, and continued global conflict and fragility, all of which threaten to undermine global economic growth. At the same time, rapid technological innovation, including through artificial intelligence, will create both costs and benefits and has the potential to profoundly reshape the economic landscape.\nI believe that the strength of the U.S. economic recovery has put us on solid ground to navigate these challenges and to capture the benefits from the opportunities that are sure to unfold. This was far from inevitable. The U.S. economy is uniquely strong compared to what might have been. In the years to come, it is crucial that sound economic policymaking sustain this momentum to the benefit of millions of Americans.\nThank you again for this honor.\n###\n[1] How does the Well-Being of Young Adults Compare to Their Parents’? | U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n[2] How does the Well-Being of Young Adults Compare to Their Parents’? | U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n[7] A Third Quarter Update to “The Purchasing Power of American Households” | U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n[8] The U.S. Post-Pandemic Recovery in Context | U.S. Department of the Treasury, citing Wheat, Chris, and George Eckerd. “The purchasing power of household incomes: Worker outcomes through July 2024 by income and race.” JPMorgan Chase, September 12, 2024.\n[11] The U.S. Post-Pandemic Recovery in Context | U.S. Department of the Treasury, citing FACT SHEET: A Record 20 Million New Business Applications | The White House.\n[13] Small Business and Entrepreneurship in the Post-COVID Expansion | U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n[16] The U.S. Post-Pandemic Recovery in Context | U.S. Department of the Treasury, citing Pethokoukis, James.

They may contain errors. JUDY WOODRUFF: The announcement from Beijing today captured the attention of scientists, diplomats and lawmakers alike. China and the United States agreed on a fast-track effort to pump less carbon into the atmosphere. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: This is an ambitious goal, but it is an achievable goal. JUDY WOODRUFF: It was an unprecedented announcement from the world's two biggest economies and carbon polluters. President Obama promised that, by 2025, the U.S. will cut carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions by more than a quarter, below the levels of 2005. BARACK OBAMA: It puts us on a path to achieving the deep emissions reductions need by advanced economies that the scientific community says is necessary to prevent the most catastrophic effects of climate change. JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. was already on track to meet an earlier goal of lowering emissions 17 percent by 2020. China, in turn, agreed today to cap emissions by 2030. It was a first for Beijing, although President Xi Jinping referred to it just once. PRESIDENT XI JINPING, China (through interpreter): We published a joint statement about dealing with climate change and together announced our individual action goals for after 2020. JUDY WOODRUFF: It remained unclear exactly how each country will achieve the goals, but the announcement set the stage for negotiations on a new global climate pact next year in Paris.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon lauded the agreement during a visit to Myanmar. BAN KI-MOON, Secretary-General, United Nations: I urge all countries, especially all major economies, to follow China and the United States' lead and announce ambitious post-2020 targets as soon as possible. JUDY WOODRUFF: On the other hand, the head of the U.N.'s panel of climate scientists said the deal will not be enough to avert the worst of global warming.And, in Washington, soon-to-be-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell charged the president's plan will mean higher energy prices and fewer jobs. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, Minority Leader: I was particularly distressed by the deal apparently he's reached with the Chinese on his current trip, which, as I read the agreement, requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years, while these carbon emission regulations are creating havoc in my state and other states around the country. JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. and China also reached agreements on trade and military cooperation this week. But tensions remain over territorial disputes in the South China Sea, as well as cyber-security and human rights.Some of the contention came through at today's rare joint news conference. On pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, President Obama called for freedom of expression and fair elections. But Xi condemned the demonstrations, and warned they're no one else's business. XI JINPING (through interpreter): Hong Kong affairs are exclusively China's internal affairs, and foreign countries shouldn't interfere in those affairs in any form or fashion. JUDY WOODRUFF: At another point, New York Times reporter Mark Landler pressed Xi about restrictions on American news organizations in China. MARK LANDLER, The New York Times: In the spirit of these visa — reciprocal visa arrangements that you have agreed to this week with businesspeople and students, isn't it time to extend that sort of right to foreign correspondents who seek to cover your country? JUDY WOODRUFF: Xi initially ignored the question, even removing the earpiece feeding him translation. Later, he blamed the restrictions on unfavorable coverage of China, and he said the party which started the problem should be the one to resolve it.From Beijing, President Obama flew to Myanmar to meet with leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. We will explore the ins and outs of the climate agreement and of broader U.S.-China relations after the news summary.

What was once expected to be a routine assessment aimed at improving implementation is now likely to become a high-stakes negotiation. The Trump administration is poised to seek additional concessions from Mexico and Canada on long-standing trade disputes, while also leveraging the review to address non-trade issues such as migration, drug trafficking, and continental defense. Both neighbors, already in talks with Washington over tariff relief, are approaching the process with caution. While the review may become a platform for the United States to secure short-term wins, it also presents a rare opportunity to modernize the agreement and strengthen North America’s shared competitiveness. How the three nations navigate this moment will shape the region’s economic future for decades.\nIntroduction\nIn 2020, the USMCA replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which had governed trade between the three partner countries since 1994. The USMCA represents a market of over 500 million people, accounting for 30 percent of global GDP. Since its ratification, significant progress has been made in expanding trade, investment, and jobs across North America. In 2024, goods and services trade within North America totaled an estimated $1.93 trillion, solidifying Mexico and Canada as the United States’ top trading partners.\nIn July 2026, on the sixth anniversary of the USMCA’s implementation, the three countries will hold a joint review to assess the agreement’s performance and determine its future. If all parties agree to renewal, the agreement will remain in force for another 16 years, with a review in 2032. However, other outcomes are possible. The agreement could enter a period of annual reviews if renewal is delayed or denied. Further, one or more countries could withdraw, opening the door to a return to bilateral arrangements or expiration in 2036.\nFor a time, Canada and Mexico anticipated a largely procedural review in 2026. That assumption no longer holds. U.S. President Donald Trump has made tariffs a cornerstone of his reshoring and manufacturing agenda, targeting not only geopolitical rivals but also long-standing trade partners like Mexico and Canada. These tariffs, often imposed for both trade-related and non-trade-related reasons, have already triggered bilateral negotiations. Their ripple effects are likely to shape the 2026 review.\nThe upcoming review will be a defining test for North American cohesion and, hence, global competitiveness. Its outcome will determine whether the region can modernize its trade framework to meet today’s economic and security challenges, or lose 30 years of economic integration at a time of increased global uncertainty, economic fragmentation, and heightened geopolitical confrontation. The stakes are high. The USMCA remains the foundation of North America’s economic strength and a key counterweight to China’s global influence. This brief outlines the mechanics of the 2026 review and explores the range of possible outcomes, the impact of the Trump administration’s reshoring efforts, and the issues that must be addressed both before the review and during the process. The brief concludes with recommendations to strengthen the agreement and ensure that North America remains an engine of prosperity in the decades ahead.\nThe Strategic Stakes\nToday, Mexico and Canada are the United States’ top trading partners. The three countries coproduce everything from automobiles to textiles and share a highly integrated agricultural market. A breakdown in cooperation would reverse this progress and expose each economy to increased external vulnerabilities, especially from China.\nIf the agreement were to break down, North American manufacturing, especially in the automotive sector, would suffer from higher costs and reduced efficiencies. Without preferential market access, goods would face tariffs and regulatory barriers, making them more expensive and less competitive in global markets. This would give an opening to rivals like China, which already competes aggressively in key sectors.\nEnergy cooperation would also take a hit. The USMCA provides protections for cross-border energy investments and facilitates the flow of electricity, natural gas, and refined products—all vital for meeting growing energy demands. The situation is especially urgent as AI, data centers, and advanced manufacturing place unprecedented strain on energy grids across the region. Without the regulatory certainty and investor protections that the USMCA provides, the capital needed to expand and modernize energy infrastructure could dry up, threatening economic resilience.\nAgriculture would also face renewed uncertainty. Integrated supply chains that allow North American farmers to export livestock, grains, fruits, and vegetables across borders would be subject to tariffs, inspections, and inconsistent standards. The result would be higher food prices for consumers and lower margins for producers, ultimately risking the region’s food security. Beyond the economic fallout, a divided, less competitive, less resilient North America would have cascading effects on other shared priorities, including efforts to combat drug trafficking, secure borders, dismantle transnational criminal organizations, and bolster hemispheric defense.\nThe region must resist the temptation to pursue zero-sum strategies that pit partners against each other in search of short-term leverage. Instead, the United States, Mexico, and Canada must identify clear, durable pathways to cement and expand cooperation and secure the region’s competitiveness in a rapidly fragmenting global economy.\nThe USMCA at Five\nTrade and Investment Momentum\nSince the USMCA took effect, intra-regional trade in goods and services has grown by 37 percent, driven largely by growth in industrial supplies and the automotive sector. In 2024, for the second consecutive year, Mexico was the top U.S. trading partner, reaching nearly $930 billion in total trade. Canada followed closely at $903 billion. Both were well ahead of U.S.-China trade flows.\nThe agreement also helped spur a 16 percent rise in foreign direct investment (FDI) across the region, according to data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The same data shows the United States remained the top global destination for FDI, attracting $278 billion in 2024. Canada rose to sixth place at $64 billion, up from tenth in 2019. Mexico, by contrast, ranked eleventh at $36 billion, reflecting both the potential and the constraints of nearshoring under the USMCA. Persistent structural challenges, including corruption, insecurity, weak rule of law, and water scarcity, continue to limit Mexico’s ability to fully capitalize on this trend. That momentum is now at risk. A new wave of U.S. tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods threatens to undermine confidence in the region’s economic model and dampen future investment.\nA More Effective Dispute Settlement System\nOne of the USMCA’s most consequential improvements over NAFTA is its state-to-state dispute settlement system. Under NAFTA, disputes often stalled because one party could block the formation of a panel by refusing to appoint panelists or agree on a roster. The USMCA addresses this flaw through Article 31.8, which creates a standing list of preapproved independent trade experts, ensuring that dispute resolution panels could be formed even when one party is uncooperative.\nNAFTA’s shortcomings are most evident in the decades-long sugar dispute between the United States and Mexico. Despite ongoing violations, the United States declined to form a panel, citing the absence of an agreed-upon roster. This technicality functioned as a veto, leaving Mexico without recourse under the formal dispute mechanism. This issue was ultimately settled through a side agreement, underscoring the limits of NAFTA’s legal framework.\nThe USMCA broke that pattern. In its first five years, four state-to-state disputes moved through the panel process with final rulings issued. The smooth activation of panels and the parties’ willingness to rely on formal mechanisms suggest a stronger collective commitment to enforceable rules under the agreement. A notable exception is the automotive rules of origin dispute: The United States has failed to comply with the panel ruling for more than two-and-a-half years. Meanwhile, other disputes, such as those related to Mexico’s energy policies, have yet to move beyond initial consultations, reflecting political calculations that weigh more heavily than investor certainty.\nAt the same time, the USMCA significantly narrowed the scope of investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). The mechanism was eliminated between the United States and Canada. Between the United States and Mexico, it now applies only in limited cases involving sectors such as oil and gas, power generation, telecommunications, transportation, and infrastructure.\nCanadian investors in Mexico and Mexican investors in Canada can still pursue ISDS claims under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which offers an alternative avenue for covered investments and alleged breaches of investment protections. This remains an option that the USMCA explicitly removes between the two countries.\nLabor Rights Tools: Progress and Limits\nThe USMCA transformed Mexico’s labor compliance landscape in targeted instances through its Rapid-Response Labor Mechanism (RRM), designed to address labor rights violations at specific facilities. Between May 2021 and June 2025, the United States triggered 37 known cases, and one further case was initiated by Canada. Twenty-seven cases were successfully resolved, yielding a resolution rate of nearly 71 percent.\nThousands of Mexican workers in the auto sector (where, 61 percent of RRM cases originate, as of June 2025) have secured wage increases, bonuses, reinstatement after wrongful termination, and government-sponsored training on their rights. These advances underscore the USMCA’s role in reshaping the region’s trade-labor nexus and its potential as a platform for further progress.\nHowever, Mexico’s ability to invoke the RRM against facilities in the United States or Canada remains severely restricted by carve-outs that impose much higher evidentiary and procedural thresholds. This asymmetry has led to criticism that the RRM is not a truly reciprocal tool for upholding labor rights across the region.\nSimilarly, some experts argue that the USMCA’s labor provisions—particularly its new wage thresholds, which are well above Mexico’s average—risk suppressing overall productivity and pushing more workers into Mexico’s informal sector. They warn that few factories can meet these requirements, which may limit access to USMCA tariff preferences and reduce the competitiveness of Mexican manufacturing workers relative to their U.S. and Canadian counterparts.\nAfter five years, while transformative in parts of the manufacturing sector, the USMCA falls short as a broader policy solution to Mexico’s structural labor challenges. It has yet to deliver economy-wide improvements in productivity, labor rights, or wages beyond select manufacturing hubs. Achieving such outcomes will require ambitious domestic policies that narrow Mexico’s formal-informal divide and create stronger incentives for formal employment.\nPresident Trump’s Reindustrialization Drive Through Tariffs\nAlmost immediately upon taking office in January 2025, President Trump pivoted away from the bipartisan effort to create more manufacturing in the United States—particularly through incentives like those in the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act developed under President Joe Biden—and toward policies focused on building a tariff wall around U.S. industry. The Trump administration first used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose a 25 percent tariff on non-USMCA-compliant goods, with the justification that drug and migrant flows from Mexico and Canada (and China) represent a national emergency for the United States. Then, the president placed Section 232 tariffs on global steel and aluminum, first at 25 percent, then at 50 percent. On July 30, 2025, President Trump imposed a 50 percent tariff on imports of semi-finished copper products and copper-intensive derivative products. Canada and Mexico have both felt a disproportionate impact from the steel and aluminum tariffs, as they are the largest and third-largest exporters of steel to the United States, respectively, jointly accounting for 40 percent of U.S. imports. Canada is also largest exporter of aluminum to the United States, accounting for 56 percent of U.S. aluminum imports.\nOn March 26, 2025, President Trump signed a proclamation adjusting the tariff rates on automobiles and auto parts, placing a worldwide 25 percent tariff, including on autos from Mexico and Canada, regardless of USMCA compliance. He made an exception for U.S. content in vehicles imported from Mexico and Canada. On April 2, 2025, he also rolled out a global reciprocal tariff scheme, with a worldwide baseline tariff of 10 percent and even higher percentages for numerous countries, which he subsequently paused for 90 days. Mexico and Canada were exempted from the reciprocal tariff but in July 2025 were threatened with a higher blanket tariff of 30 percent and 35 percent, respectively. That new tariff took effect on August 1 for Canada, while Mexico’s tariff was paused for another 90 days to allow for further negotiations. Carve-outs for USMCA-compliant goods remained in place.\nMexico and Canada also face further uncertainties because of looming Section 232 investigations into timber and lumber, trucks, commercial aircraft and jet engines, and possibly processed critical minerals. The results of these investigations would likely impact Mexican and Canadian industries disproportionately relative to other U.S. trading partners, given that they are among the top exporters of these goods and commodities to the United States.\nAll of these actions weaken investor confidence, jeopardize the region’s hard-won gains, and risk eroding North American competitiveness at a critical moment. Recent judicial decisions, which are being appealed, have also created legal ambiguity over IEEPA authorities, adding further legal and policy uncertainty. Should the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit strike down IEEPA-based tariffs, the administration is likely to shift toward Sections 232, 301, and 338, as well as new nontariff barriers, including restrictions at the sub-federal level, even if such tools take longer to implement than IEEPA tariffs.\nIn addition to building this protectionist wall during the first months of the second Trump administration, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) has grown increasingly skeptical of multilateral enforcement tools. Presidents Biden and Trump both refused to comply with key USMCA panel rulings, including the high-profile decision on automotive rules of origin. Instead, the current administration favors using bilateral tactics that can build pressure on U.S. neighbors to achieve outcomes outside formal dispute channels. This erosion of trust threatens to undermine the USMCA’s institutional credibility.\nThe various rounds of protectionist tariffs have triggered intense bilateral negotiations between the United States and its two North American partners seeking to have the levies dropped or reduced. These negotiations involve trade and nontrade issues, and their successful resolution, or not, will influence the positions the United States and its partners take when the USMCA review process begins in earnest.\nMexico’s Response: Quiet Diplomacy, Tangible Concessions\nFollowing President Trump’s hardline rhetoric and economic coercion of Mexico, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum opted for diplomacy over confrontation. Rather than retaliate, she voiced confidence that Mexico could negotiate “better conditions” and reach a deal to reduce tariffs. Her administration has actively pursued a strategy of de-escalation through swift diplomatic engagement and increased enforcement actions on migration and narcotics. These efforts led to the creation of a permanent U.S.-Mexico working group on security, migration, border management, water, and economic ties. A parallel working group was also established in 2023, focused on FDI coordination, particularly Chinese capital flows into Mexico—a point of growing concern for Washington regarding potential circumvention of U.S. tariffs.\nThe Trump administration has made clear that Mexico’s access to the U.S. market will depend not just on action against fentanyl and illegal migration but also on addressing perceived trade imbalances. President Sheinbaum has acknowledged drug consumption as a shared challenge and continues to call for bilateral cooperation. Still, her government has delivered results: Since she took office in October 2024, fentanyl seizures have surged, including a record bust of 1.1 metric tons in December 2025. According to President Sheinbaum, fentanyl trafficking at the U.S.-Mexico border is down 50 percent. In addition, in February 2025, the Mexican government transferred 29 high-level criminal suspects to U.S. custody; in August 2025, they transferred 26 more suspects.\nOn migration, Sheinbaum stepped up the deployment of Mexican National Guard troops to the border, which has contributed to a dramatic reduction in unauthorized arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border to the lowest rate since the 1960s—the sharpest drop in the twenty-first century. Mexico has also allowed U.S. surveillance drone flights over its territory, acknowledging their role in operations against cartels, and has agreed to coordinated patrols along the border with the U.S. military. Yet President Sheinbaum has drawn a red line at boots on the ground,unequivocally rejecting proposals for U.S. troops to operate inside Mexico, stating, “Sovereignty is not for sale.”\nOn trade, Sheinbaum has publicly condemned the proposed tariffs as “unfair treatment” but has largely refrained from issuing retaliatory tariffs, choosing instead to focus on dialogue and concrete results. This contrasts with Canada’s initial, more direct public acknowledgement of a fundamental shift in the relationship and its imposition of retaliatory tariffs. Mexico’s strategy of de-escalation through verifiable actions and firm diplomatic messaging has, for the moment, avoided the most severe new blanket tariffs on exports to the United States under the USMCA, albeit under continued uncertainty. But Mexico’s strategy carries risk. The United States can always move the goalposts, and without clear benchmarks or concessions in return, Sheinbaum’s quiet diplomacy could be politically costly, especially as the 2026 USMCA review approaches and expectations in Washington continue to rise.\nCanada’s Response: Strategic Reset and a New Security Bargain\nCanada has responded with a sharper tone. In light of U.S. economic coercion and President Trump’s rhetoric around Canada being the “51st state,” recently elected Prime Minister Mark Carney declared, “Our old relationship with the United States, a relationship based on steadily increased integration, is over.” In its place, the prime minister sought to negotiate a new security and economic agreement with the United States. At the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alberta, President Trump and Prime Minister Carney agreed to launch a 30-day countdown to negotiate a new cross-border agreement, which was subsequently extended to August 1.\nThe Trump administration has made it clear to Canada, like Mexico, that access to the U.S. market will depend on the northern neighbor addressing U.S. trade and nontrade concerns. This includes action on the border against illegal migration and the flow of fentanyl and money laundering, but perhaps just as important, it requires shouldering more of the burden for continental defense and an increased commitment to NATO. This is nothing new: 20 years ago, President George W. Bush’s ambassador to Canada, Paul Cellucci, famously said that for the United States, “Security trumps trade.” The difference is the degree to which the Trump administration is willing to go to force Canada to pick up the slack on defense.\nPrime Minister Carney is attempting to negotiate a reduction or elimination of the various tariffs by simultaneously addressing security and defense irritants ahead of any renegotiation of the USMCA. On the trade side of this three-way equation, Carney has already axed Canada’s digital services tax in response to new threats and an abrupt interruption of negotiations. Canadian officials are also discussing softwood lumber quotas with their American counterparts. On the security side, Carney pushed Bill C-2 through Canada’s parliament, which gives increased powers to the country’s security and intelligence services, expands the government’s ability to open and inspect mail, and allows officials to cancel or suspend immigration documents. His predecessor, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, had already announced investments in border surveillance equipment and capacity, including military support for intelligence analysis and logistics, along with additional federal and provincial personnel to police the border. He also established a Canada-U.S. enforcement strike force to combat organized crime and fentanyl trafficking alongside the Integrated Money Laundering Intelligence Partnership.\nOn the defense side, Prime Minister Carney publicly promised President Trump a “step change” in Canada’s defense investments and its partnership with the United States when the two met at the White House on May 6. In addition, Carney committed to spending 2 percent of GDP on defense by March 2026 and 5 percent by 2035. Moreover, he has directed Canada’s Department of National Defense to engage in discussions on Trump’s Golden Dome missile defense plan. Consistent with this, on July 16, 2025, Canada’s minister of national defense removed all restrictions on Canada’s air and missile defense. Negotiations continue, and the prime minister has said that his government is working toward an agreement in a constructive manner. More recently, however, Carney admitted there is little evidence that Canada will secure a trade deal with the United States that does not impose some tariffs. Elimination or further reduction in tariffs will likely be left up to whatever additional concessions Canada (and Mexico) is willing to offer during the USMCA review, such as putting an end to Canada’s supply management system, perhaps a greater opening of Canada’s banking sector, an agreement on softwood lumber, and possibly some deal—or side deal—on greater critical minerals cooperation.\nThe cumulative effect of these political and economic dynamics has been a decline in trust in North America’s institutions, including the USMCA, with tensions increasingly crowding out near-term opportunities for bilateral and trilateral cooperation. Yet global fragmentation and escalating U.S.-China rivalry have made North American stability and deeper economic integration through the USMCA more urgent than ever. The 2026 USMCA review must become a turning point, not a breaking point, for the future of regional integration.\nUnderstanding the 2026 Review Clause: Pathways, Risks, and Leverage\nThe USMCA is designed to last 16 years, expiring on July 1, 2036, unless the parties agree to extend it. Article 34.7 of the agreement requires the United States, Mexico, and Canada to conduct a formal review at the six-year mark. This process requires the three governments, through their Free Trade Commission, to evaluate the agreement’s effectiveness, consider each country’s recommendations, and agree on any necessary actions, including extending the USMCA for another 16 years or letting the agreement expire in 2036. Each country may gather input from its stakeholders, including businesses, unions, nongovernmental organizations, legislators, and local authorities involved in or affected by the USMCA.\nHowever, Article 34.7 leaves critical gaps and does not explicitly establish how the commission will evaluate or prioritize these proposals, nor does it specify criteria for deciding which suggestions will be considered or dismissed. Arguably, the text of the article suggests that the review mechanism is intended to evaluate the agreement’s operational outcomes, not to launch a comprehensive renegotiation of its foundational terms. However, the USMCA text does not establish what ideas qualify as part of the review process versus those that constitute a more substantive renegotiation. This ambiguity creates political space for the review process to become a venue for broader demands rather than a technical assessment of implementation and compliance. The political context suggests this process will likely be a comprehensive renegotiation of key USMCA provisions, such as regional content rules, minimum U.S. content thresholds, and common treatment of China beyond the USMCA’s nonmarket economy clause, which limits free trade negotiations with China.\nMapping Six Possible Pathways for the USMCA\nBarring an early start, the three governments are expected to officially launch the USMCA review on July 1, 2026, following internal consultations and extensive bilateral and trilateral groundwork. The following sections describe six possible outcomes or pathways, each with different implications for North American trade, investment climate, and competitiveness (see Table 2).\nRenewal\nThe three countries agree to extend the USMCA for another 16 years, through 2042, possibly with targeted updates to modernize the agreement without altering its core architecture. Renewal preserves the stability that investors and businesses value. However, it also risks complacency. The parties may delay necessary modernization to address new and important challenges such as integrating AI, securing access to critical minerals, advancing energy independence, managing borders more efficiently, and strengthening supply chain resilience. While Mexico and Canada have both expressed support for a straightforward renewal, this is currently the least likely outcome, given the tariff environment and signals from the United States that it wants significant changes, potentially under threat of withdrawal.\nPainful Extension\nMexico and Canada offer important concessions to the Trump administration to reduce U.S. tariff levels and get buy-in to extend the agreement. The agreement is successfully extended ahead of its 2036 expiration deadline, but Mexico and Canada are no longer treated as equal partners in the relationship. In this suboptimal scenario, the United States forces minimum thresholds for U.S. content in the auto sector, as well as tariff rate quotas (TRQs) on Mexican and Canadian manufacturing and agricultural products. Rules of origin are strengthened, and minimum wage thresholds are increased to reduce the universe of goods that receive preferential tariff treatment under the USMCA. While this scenario reduces uncertainty levels, it will likely raise inflation and unemployment in the three countries, given potential losses in regional productivity and competitiveness. In this moderate-likelihood scenario, the accompanying loss of trust in the United States places strain on opportunities for trilateral cooperation on security, immigration, critical minerals, and border management.\nWithdrawal\nAny party can invoke USMCA Article 34.6 and exit the agreement with six months’ notice, regardless of the review process. While no government has formally signaled an intention to invoke this provision, governments may be tempted to use it as a bargaining chip, reminiscent of Trump’s approach during his first term, which led to NAFTA’s renegotiation in 2018. Withdrawal triggers immediate trade disruption and likely provokes retaliatory measures, compounding economic uncertainty, harming cross-border industries, and raising tensions between parties. Withdrawal also marks a strategic shift away from regional integration, with severe consequences for the region’s competitiveness.\nFallback to Bilateral Deals\nIn the event of failure to sustain the USMCA, the parties may pursue bilateral trade agreements to preserve market access and supply chain ties. Such deals likely offer less coherence and fewer efficiencies associated with a unified regional framework. Trade and investment continue but under more fragmented conditions. Mexico and Canada may maintain preferential access to each other’s markets through the CPTPP, and Canada and the United States may revert to their 1989 trade agreement. All three countries may fall back on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, but the WTO’s weakened dispute settlement system and new U.S. tariffs across multiple sectors will provide little meaningful enforcement and few opportunities to expand trade or job creation. Mexico and the United States may also negotiate a bilateral framework to facilitate trade and investment. However, bilateral deals will likely favor the interests of the United States more heavily over those of its North American counterparts.\nThis pathway imposes unnecessary costs on trade and investments vital to North America’s long-term security, competitiveness, and other goals, including labor and environmental standards. Bilateral fallback deals mean firms will face inconsistent rules of origin, standards, and customs procedures, undermining supply chain integration and eroding the region’s collective leverage in global markets. All three countries would likely face welfare loss under this scenario.\nSerial Annual Reviews\nIf at least one government refuses to agree to an extension during the 2026 review, this will trigger annual reviews beginning in 2027. In this scenario, the agreement stays in force but under a cloud of uncertainty that could persist for up to a decade. Annual reviews damage investor confidence and long-term investment bets on North America, weakening supply chain integration. It is possible that Mexico or Canada, or both, may see annual reviews as preferable to agreeing to new steep demands from the Trump administration (as in the above-mentioned painful extension scenario), hoping that when a new U.S. administration takes office in January 2029, it may have a more favorable view of its North American trade partners. Of course, this approach would have to be calculated against the risk of a severe reaction from the Trump administration.\nExpiration in 2036\nIf the parties fail to resolve their differences through annual reviews over the next 10 years, the USMCA will terminate on July 1, 2036. Expiration dismantles the institutional framework supporting North American trade and investment, and regional trade relations revert to WTO terms or pre-USMCA arrangements. Expiration also unravels the institutional gains of the USMCA and those of NAFTA before it. The return of tariffs and regulatory fragmentation would damage North America’s position in global supply chains and reduce its competitiveness with China, Europe, and other Asian economies. Table 3 shows the timeline of the review process, including the available pathways for the three countries.\nWhat Will Be on the Table: Disputes, Demands, and Deal-Breakers\nThe 2026 USMCA review will be a high-stakes negotiation in which each government will seek to address long-standing grievances, secure new concessions, and defend core economic interests. The following pressure points are poised to dominate the agenda.\nLabor Enforcement\nLabor will remain at the forefront of U.S. priorities. The United States will push for stricter implementation of the USMCA’s minimum wage provisions and seek to expand the use of the RRM in Mexico. U.S. unions, backed by key members of Congress and the USTR, will likely demand faster case resolution, broader application of the RRM beyond the manufacturing sector, and stronger efforts to combat forced labor, not just as a labor issue but also as a tool to limit China’s trade footprint in North America.\nRegional Content Rules\nRules of origin will remain a contentious topic. The United States is expected to revisit demands for higher regional content thresholds in automotives, steel, aluminum, and other key sectors. Proposals could include raising regional value content thresholds for finished vehicles and parts, creating minimum thresholds for U.S. content within broader regional targets, and limiting imports on vehicles and other goods that do not meet higher North American content standards through tariff rate quotas and other measures, including export controls and minimum thresholds for U.S. content to maintain preferential tariff treatment.\nThese demands reflect growing pressure to secure U.S. manufacturing jobs. They also reflect pressures to reduce China’s presence in basic inputs for goods that are assembled in North America, but this could strain supply chains and create friction with both Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Canada. Failure to find common ground on rules of origin during the review could result in new compliance disputes and undermine North American supply chain integration. As one observer noted, “Rules of origin are only as good as our tools to enforce them.” Rather than simply raise thresholds, the three countries should focus on strengthening enforcement to effectively combat transshipped and misclassified goods.\nEnergy Policy\nMexico’s state dominance in oil and electricity will remain a flash point. The United States and Canada will seek assurances that energy prices, electricity generation, and market access are nondiscriminatory—that is, there is no favoritism for Mexican state-owned enterprises (SOEs) PEMEX and CFE at the expense of foreign investors or importers. Both countries have already launched USMCA consultations over Mexico’s policies, alleging breaches of chapters on market access, investment, and SOEs.\nNegotiations may explore tax adjustments or other balancing mechanisms to address price differentials that disadvantage U.S. or Canadian companies, but the complexity of these issues, coupled with Mexico’s nationalist energy policies (now crystallized in the country’s constitutional reforms), will make resolution difficult. Like the rules of origin issue, energy tensions could stall broader review progress and chill investor confidence if not handled creatively.\nDigital Trade\nThe U.S. retreat from its earlier digital trade commitments has opened a new front in the review. Mexico and Canada will likely press the United States to clarify its stance on cross-border data flows, source code protections, and digital services market access. The USMCA’s digital trade provisions (Chapter 19) were cutting-edge when negotiated but no longer fit the fast-paced, data-driven economy of today, particularly with the rise of AI. An updated framework will need to preserve open digital trade among the three partners while addressing concerns over national security, privacy, and competition not present when the USMCA was first negotiated. Digital modernization is critical to safeguard North America’s competitiveness.\nAgriculture\nAgricultural disputes—particularly over corn and seasonal fruit and vegetable competition from Mexico; Canada’s supply management system for milk, poultry, and eggs; and biotechnology—will certainly resurface. The United States will press Mexico to fully honor its commitments on biotech products, including corn for nonhuman consumption. Canada’s supply management protectionism will remain a sore point, with pressure to expand U.S. market access or face penalties. But there are also opportunities, including coordinating data collection and analysis to aid in precision farming, sharing technologies to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change on agriculture, reducing physical and digital bottlenecks in transportation and at border crossings, fostering more trilateral academic and research exchanges on agriculture, and ensuring greater collaboration in both the discovery and deployment phases of innovation.\nCritical Minerals\nThe first Trump administration correctly began reducing the country’s exposure to Chinese critical mineral supply chains, given China’s near-monopolistic control of many minerals. As part of this process, the first Trump administration signed the Canada–United States Joint Action Plan on Critical Minerals. Focus on critical minerals has only accelerated during the second Trump administration, with executive orders on mining and offshore mining, and an agreement with Ukraine. Given Canada’s abundance of critical minerals and the importance of these materials to the U.S. economy, the 25 percent IEEPA tariff has a carve-out for Canadian critical minerals (and energy), taxing those resources at the lower rate of 10 percent.\nMexico is also endowed with important critical minerals. Previous CSIS research has recommended closer U.S.-Canada cooperation on defense-critical minerals and rare earth elements (REEs), including joint refining projects and licensing Canadian REE refining technology. A USMCA chapter on critical minerals would, first and foremost, eliminate tariffs on these essential elements. It could include aligning regulatory frameworks to create a more supportive environment for critical mineral mining and processing, as well as cooperation on stockpiling and joint processing. It could include provisions to guarantee supply in case of external shocks and visas for highly trained mining engineers and other professionals to work seamlessly across North America.\nAdditional Section 232 Investigations\nThere are also additional Section 232 investigations into timber and lumber, copper, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, medium and heavy trucks, processed critical minerals, and commercial aircraft and jet engines, among other sectors. In each of these sectors, Mexico and Canada are either the top or one of the top exporters to the United States. New tariffs could further complicate USMCA negotiations and undercut regional supply chains at a time when deeper integration is most needed.\nThe China Question\nA critical focus of the 2026 review will be how North America responds to China’s growing role in regional supply chains. U.S. officials have clearly signaled their intent to use the review to bring their partners, especially Mexico, more in line with Washington’s approach. Canada has largely mirrored U.S. trade policy by tightening restrictions on Chinese goods, including the imposition of higher tariffs. Mexico, by contrast, has pursued a more nuanced stance. Some Mexican officials are actively courting China to bolster investment flows, while others have promoted import substitution policies designed to reduce dependence on Chinese imports, as reflected in Mexico’s recent hikes in most-favored-nation tariffs on non-preferential trading partners (which disproportionately affect China) and initiatives like Plan México.\nImportantly, the USMCA’s Article 32.10, which limits trade agreements with nonmarket economies such as China, does not address the national security challenges associated with increased Chinese investment. While the United States employs the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to screen inbound investments for security risks and Canada uses mechanisms under its Investment Canada Act, Mexico has yet to establish a comparable national security review framework, despite promising the Biden administration that it would stand up a comparable institution.\nTo close this gap, a trilateral or regionally coordinated investment screening mechanism could help safeguard North America’s security and economic interests. By defining and enforcing shared red lines on sensitive investments, such a system could prove more effective than unilateral tariffs or ad hoc restrictions and better equip the region to meet the strategic challenge posed by China.\nCoalitions and Crosscurrents\nThis negotiation will not be simply two against one; coalitions will shift issue by issue. The United States and Canada will align on agricultural biotechnology, energy, critical minerals, China policy, and the importance of the rule of law. By contrast, Canada and Mexico may find common cause in resisting U.S. demands on automotive rules of origin or extraterritorial labor enforcement. Other issues, such as digital trade or new sectoral provisions, may create different alignments altogether.\nBeyond trade, managing migration, border, and security and defense issues will bleed into the review process. Shifting alliances and conflicting positions on issues will require careful diplomacy and a shared commitment to preserving regional stability and competitiveness. The core challenge will be to balance national interests with the collective imperative of sustaining a cohesive, resilient, and globally competitive North American economic bloc.\nKeeping Sights High: Options to Deepen Cooperation Under the USMCA\nThe 2026 USMCA review should not be seen as a threat to North American integration, but rather as an opportunity to modernize and strengthen the agreement. To secure the region’s economic and strategic interests, the three countries should focus on cooperative solutions that reinforce North America’s competitiveness, resilience, and cohesion. The parties may wish to consider the following actions during the review:\n- Launch a regional supply chain security mechanism. The three countries should create a permanent platform dedicated to supply chain security and transparency. Such a mechanism would map regional supply chains to identify vulnerabilities, especially regarding critical goods and inputs. Policymakers should establish joint standards for traceability and origin verification, helping prevent transshipment, misclassification of goods, and forced labor, particularly from nonmarket economies like China. The parties should align security protocols, including FDI screening, to better protect sensitive industries. This outcome would be complex but achievable, providing North America with the tools to defend its economic security.\n- Harmonize infrastructure and border management. To enhance the efficiency of cross-border trade, the parties should coordinate customs practices by expanding joint inspections and preclearance programs at key border crossings. They should align infrastructure investments (e.g., ports, rail, highways, and energy connections) to ensure that physical and digital infrastructure supports seamless commerce. They also should develop common protocols for managing future crises (e.g., pandemics and natural disasters) that could disrupt trade flows.\n- Modernize the USMCA with new side letters and additional commitments. The 2026 review should serve as a platform to update and strengthen North America’s trade framework. Rather than reopen the core text, which could prove politically difficult, especially given the absence of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) in the United States, the parties should consider adopting side letters or other binding instruments to address new priorities without triggering full legislative approval processes. Key areas for modernization include the following:\n- Artificial intelligence: The partners should define shared principles for AI governance, including transparency, ethics, and interoperability standards, with flexibility to update as technologies evolve.\n- Digital trade: The parties should revise Chapter 19 of the agreement to address cross-border data flows, AI, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies, preserving an open and secure digital economy in North America. This area will require careful work by all three parties.\n- Critical minerals: While much of this area will involve bilateral coordination, a trilateral framework could set common principles for sourcing, environmental standards, and shared strategic reserves to reduce dependence on external suppliers, build a regional supply chain, and insulate against price shocks. As mentioned, policymakers could also consider creating a new USMCA chapter on critical minerals.\n- Energy: North America needs a more structured and strategic approach to energy cooperation. The three countries should establish a North American Energy Business Council, a permanent mechanism that brings together industry leaders, policymakers, and technical experts to share best practices, identify priority projects, and coordinate investment. In parallel, energy should be formally integrated into the North American Competitiveness Committee (NACC), as established under the USMCA. Doing so would align regulatory priorities, streamline cross-border infrastructure planning, and support the development of a sustainable, integrated regional energy market. An annual North American energy summit, held alongside NACC meetings, could also be explored.\nOther areas for continued dialogue include emerging technology threats and the evolution of criminal groups seeking to integrate themselves into legitimate cross-border commerce.\nStronger Together\nThe USMCA review is not just a procedural step; it is a defining test of whether North America can remain competitive, cohesive, and resilient in an era of global uncertainty. By leveraging side letters, strengthening enforcement of new and existing commitments, and targeting areas for modernization, the region can achieve the flexibility needed to deepen integration, secure supply chains, and position North America as a global leader without reopening contentious legislative battles.\nFailure to modernize and preserve the USMCA would risk a return to uncertainty, fragmentation, and reduced competitiveness that the region simply cannot afford. By embracing cooperation, the United States, Mexico, and Canada can demonstrate that North America is not only stronger together but also ready to lead in a new era.\nDiego Marroquín Bitar is a fellow with the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.

Observed and anticipated increases in greenhouse gas emissions from China and other countries don’t let Americans off the hook for reducing emissions. From a purely physical perspective, any reduction in emissions helps minimize future temperature increases. From the perspective of fairness, the United States has released more heat-trapping gases to date than either China or India, the world’s two most populous countries. Carbon dioxide is a long-lived greenhouse gas that can linger in Earth’s atmosphere for thousands of years. Consequently, the United States bears more responsibility for the amount of warming that has occurred so far and will persist for millennia.\nThe global carbon budget\nThe United States, along with close to 200 other countries, is a party to the 2015 Paris Agreement. The agreement aims to limit “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C [3.6 ˚F] above pre-industrial levels.” Participating nations also agree to try “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C [2.7 ˚F] above pre-industrial levels.”\nTo meet these goals, humans can emit only so much more carbon dioxide, whether through fossil fuel burning, cement production, or land use change. Just as a household working with limited financial resources must adhere to a financial budget, nations trying to limit further warming must collectively adhere to a carbon budget.\nIn Climate Change: Physical Science Basis—part of its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)—the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released estimates of the allowable carbon emissions from the start of 2020. To have a 50 percent chance of capping global warming at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the group estimated that humanity should limit emissions to no more than 500 billion metric tons. For a 50 percent chance of capping global warming at 2.0°C above pre-industrial levels, humans should limit emissions to 1,350 billion metric tons. To raise the odds of hitting those targets, we would have to emit even less.\nUnfortunately, most of the estimated global carbon budget for the 1.5°C target has been spent. The AR6 concluded that humans had already burned through about four-fifths of the budget. In November 2022, the Global Carbon Project published updated estimates of the allowable carbon emissions to limit further warming. Taking into account the continued emissions since the IPCC AR6 publication, the Global Carbon Project estimated that maintaining a 50 percent chance of meeting the 1.5°C target meant limiting future emissions to 380 billion metric tons. Maintaining a 50 percent chance of meeting the 2°C target meant limiting future emissions to 1,230 billion metric tons.\nSome countries have spent much more of the budget than others.\nBig spenders\nThe Industrial Revolution began in the mid-eighteenth century, and global carbon dioxide emissions began rising measurably about a century later. Western Europe industrialized early, as did parts of the United States and Canada. Further boosting carbon emissions throughout the nineteenth century, waves of European settlers cleared forest for farmland in the United States and Canada.\nBy comparison, China and India have been relative latecomers to industrialization, although China is ramping up quickly. Even so, both countries have remained behind the United States in per person emissions and total cumulative emissions. In fact, at China’s 2021 rate of 11.47 gigatons per year, it would take roughly 15 years to match the U.S. historical contribution. At India’s 2021 rate of 2.71 gigatons per year, it would take about 135 years to catch up to the United States.\nIn 1973, U.S. per capita carbon dioxide emissions were 20 times those of China’s and 66 times those of India’s. By the year 2000, when many U.S. policymakers and consumers were aware of the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, U.S. per person emissions had dropped to just over 21 metric tons per year, while China’s and India’s had risen to 2.9 and 0.9 respectively. That meant U.S. per person emissions were seven times those of China’s and 23 times those of India’s. Since then, the United States' per person emission rate has continued to drop, but the country's 2021 per person carbon dioxide emissions were still nearly twice as large as China's and nearly 8 times as large as India's. (Explore these and other comparisons through the interactive charts and maps at the excellent Our World in Data: CO2 emissions site.)\nFurthermore, national emissions are not wholly independent of each other. Much of China’s rising emissions are related to manufacturing, with many of the resulting products increasingly purchased by American consumers. The United States imported $450.4 billion worth of goods from China in 2020 alone, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. (Our World in Data allows users to view emissions adjusted by production and consumption of imported and exported goods.)\nHow much of the carbon budget does the United States have left?\nIf we agree to the premise that each country is entitled to use up a chunk of the remaining carbon budget that’s proportional to its population, the United States has nothing left to spend. In fact, the United States has overspent, according to a new analysis by Scientific American.\nThe study tallied historical emissions by country, divided each nation’s carbon budget by world population to arrive at a per person carbon budget, then multiplied the per person budget by national population. By this measure, the United States has overspent its carbon budget by roughly 346 billion metric tons. Scientific American found that Russia, the European Union, and the world’s highest per person emitters at present (Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait) have also exceeded their carbon budgets.\nThe United States’ big population partially contributes to national carbon overspending, but keep in mind that China and India each have roughly four times the U.S. population. As of 2021, according to Our World in Data, the United States population was 337 million while China’s was 1.43 billion and India’s was 1.41 billion.\nIn short, the United States bears a greater share of the responsibility for current conditions—on both a national and per-person level.\nAny reduction in emissions is beneficial\nRising emissions from China and India could eventually overshadow total U.S. emissions, and could easily push global warming past the 1.5°C goal, and even past the 2°C goal. This looming possibility might make U.S. emission reductions seem pointless, but they are not. If heat-trapping emissions continue, where they originate won’t matter nearly as much as how big they are and how long they continue.\nThe smaller the increase in average global temperatures over the next several decades, the better off humanity and other life on Earth will be. A temperature increase of 2.5°C is better than 3°C, which is better than 3.5°C, and so on. Even though the United States no longer leads the world in total annual carbon dioxide emissions, it was still, as of 2021, releasing about 5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, which was about 13.49 percent of the total global emissions—more than twice that of all 28 countries in the European Union combined. Those emissions will continue to drive global warming.

Our projections primarily reflect current–law spending requirements and tax provisions, while relying on our independent assessment of the outlook for California’s economy, demographics, revenues, and expenditures. The report aims to assist the Legislature with its fiscal planning as it begins to consider revisions to the 2010–11 budget and adoption of the 2011–12 budget. The basis of our estimates is described in the nearby box.\nBasis for Our Estimates\nOur revenue and expenditure forecasts are based primarily on the requirements of current law, including constitutional provisions (such as the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee for school funding), statutory requirements, and currently authorized federal funding. In other cases, the estimates incorporate effects of projected changes in caseloads, federal requirements, and other factors affecting program costs. The estimates are not predictions of what the Legislature and the Governor will adopt as policies and funding levels in future budgets. Instead, our estimates are intended to be a reasonable baseline of what would happen if current–law policies continue to operate in the future. We intend the forecast to provide a meaningful starting point for legislative deliberations involving the state’s budget so that corrective actions can be taken.\nNo COLAs or Inflation Adjustments Assumed. In line with the Legislature’s policy in recent years, we generally have not made annual cost–of–living adjustments (COLAs) or price increase adjustments over our forecast period. (Health programs are an exception since the costs of current–law benefits are subject to inflationary increases.) In particular, in the 2009–10 budget package the Legislature added to state law a provision stating that most programs, including universities, the courts, and various social services programs, would no longer receive “automatic” COLAs and inflation adjustments. The impact of not adjusting for COLAs and inflation means that the purchasing power of current state expenditures will be eroded by inflation over the forecast period and the state will not be able to maintain a “current services” budget. Should the Legislature choose to provide these adjustments in future years, we estimate that the state’s annual budget problems would be even greater than those indicated in our forecast—by about $400 million in 2011–12 and, if inflation adjustments were provided each year during the forecast, by as much as $3 billion in 2015–16. If the Legislature were to approve additional state employee pay or benefit increases (beyond those included in recent labor agreements), that also would increase costs above those indicated in our forecast.\nImpact of Future Ballot Measures Not Considered. In keeping with our use of current law as the basis for our forecast, our projections do not consider any future impact of measures scheduled for future statewide elections—the $11 billion water bond and the budget reserve and spending measure passed as part of the 2010–11 budget package. We do, however, incorporate our preliminary estimates of the fiscal effects of propositions that were passed on November 2, 2010.\nState Victories in Court Cases Assumed. Our forecast generally assumes that the state eventually prevails in active, budget–related court cases. (By active cases, we mean open cases at the trial or appellate court level.) The state faces an array of active cases, including ones related to the budgeted shift of redevelopment funds and various health and social services reductions. The state also is appealing a three–judge panel’s order to reduce the prison population to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n|\nFigure 1 shows our estimate of the condition of the General Fund through the end of 2011–12 assuming no corrective action. The 2010–11 fiscal year would end with a $6 billion deficit. In 2011–12, expenditures would exceed revenues by $19 billion and leave the state with a year–end deficit of over $25 billion. Accordingly, we estimate that the Legislature and the new Governor will have to address a budget problem of $25 billion between now and the time that they agree to a 2011–12 state budget plan.\nFigure 1\nLAO Projection of General Fund Condition if No Corrective Actions Are Taken\n(In Millions)\n|\n|\n2009–10\n|\n2010–11\n|\n2011–12\n|\n|\nPrior–year fund balance\n|\n–$5,375\n|\n–$5,371\n|\n–$4,591\n|\n|\nRevenues and transfers\n|\n87,041\n|\n93,284\n|\n83,530\n|\n|\nExpenditures\n|\n87,037\n|\n92,505\n|\n102,756\n|\n|\nEnding fund balance\n|\n–$5,371\n|\n–$4,591\n|\n–$23,817\n|\n|\nEncumbrances\n|\n1,537\n|\n1,537\n|\n1,537\n|\n|\nReservea\n|\n–$6,908\n|\n–$6,128\n|\n–$25,354\n|\n2010–11 to End in Deficit\nProjected 2010–11 Year–End Deficit of $6 Billion\n$3.5 Billion of New Funding or Flexibility Not Yet Approv ed by U.S. Government. At the time the Governor signed the 2010–11 budget package in October 2010, the administration estimated that the General Fund would have a $1.3 billion reserve at the end of 2010–11. A key assumption in that calculation was that the state would receive around $4 billion in federal funding (or additional flexibility in operating state–federal programs like Medi–Cal) that had not yet been approved by the federal government. Recently, the federal government approved a waiver affecting Medi–Cal and other health programs that provides annual General Fund savings that is initially estimated to total around $500 million per year. Our forecast assumes that the state fails to secure the remaining $3.5 billion of additional federal funding or flexibility incorporated into the 2010–11 budget package. Accordingly, based on that assumption alone, our projections show a General Fund deficit at the end of 2010–11.\nA Net $3 Billion of Other Budget Solutions Likely at Risk. In addition to the inability to secure federal funding, we assume the state will be unable to achieve the following 2009–10 and/or 2010–11 budget solutions counted on in the 2010–11 budget package:\n- Prisons and Medical Care Receiver. We expect that expenses of the prison medical care Receiver will exceed budgeted amounts by about $780 million and that other prison expenses will surpass budgeted totals by $185 million.\n- Employee Compensation. Recent collective bargaining agreements and other personnel actions are projected to achieve over $400 million less in savings than assumed in the 2010–11 budget. In addition, in 2009–10, the state enacted a one–day payroll delay to achieve one–time savings of about $1 billion. Estimates now indicate the delay achieved savings of $800 million.\n- Medi–Cal. Around $400 million of budgeted savings are estimated to be unachievable in Medi–Cal due to (1) the late passage of the 2010–11 budget and (2) our projection that the program will be unable to achieve an unallocated budget reduction of $323 million.\n- In–Home Supportive Services (IHSS) Program. As part of the 2010–11 budget package, a variety of solutions were estimated to reduce IHSS costs by $300 million. We estimate that only about one–half of this savings will materialize. In addition, $45 million of budgeted savings from previously enacted anti–fraud activities will not be achieved.\n- Lower Property Tax Estimate Affects General Fund Education Spending. Our forecast assumes lower local property tax revenues than the 2010–11 budget package. General Fund spending on Proposition 98, therefore, is over $400 million higher in our forecast for 2009–10 and 2010–11 combined.\n- Information Technology Savings. The budget package assumed the administration would reduce departmental budgets by $130 million in 2009–10 and $140 million in 2010–11 to capture savings from recent efficiencies implemented in information technology programs. Our forecast assumes that much of this savings does not flow to the General Fund’s bottom line.\n2009–10 and 2010–11 Revenue Projection Down $447 Million. The 2010–11 budget package essentially relied on our office’s May 2010 revenue forecast for 2009–10 and 2010–11, which was $1.4 billion higher than the administration’s. Our current projection has General Fund revenues $447 million below the budget package forecast for 2009–10 and 2010–11 combined.\nProposition 22 Reduces General Fund Solutions by Nearly $800 Million. There is some uncertainty about what Propositions 22 and 26 mean for state finance in the short term, as discussed in the nearby box. Our forecast, however, assumes that Proposition 22 prevents the state from achieving nearly $800 million in budgeted 2010–11 solutions—about $400 million in now–prohibited borrowing from the Highway Users Tax Account and $400 million in now–prohibited use of transportation funds to pay bond debt service.\nEffects of November 2010 Ballot Measures on Our Forecast\nThree major budget–related measures were approved by voters at the November 2 general election. Proposition 25 changes the vote threshold needed to send a budget bill to the Governor from two–thirds to a simple majority of each house of the Legislature. This may help make it easier for the Legislature to pass an on–time budget each year. At the same time, voters approved Propositions 22 and 26, which restrict the Legislature’s ability to use certain local funds to help balance the budget and raise the vote threshold for passing certain fees from a simple majority to two–thirds, respectively.\nOur Assumptions Concerning Propositions 22 and 26. We assume that Proposition 22 prevents the state from borrowing certain transportation special funds for the General Fund, as was assumed in the Legislature’s 2010–11 budget plan. We also assume that loans from such special funds prior to November 3 (the effective date of the measure) are not affected by Proposition 22. Accordingly, in our forecast, about $400 million of not–yet–executed loans from the Highway Users Tax Account are assumed to be prohibited by Proposition 22. This worsens the condition of the General Fund in 2010–11 by a like amount. The budgeted use of certain transportation funding to offset General Fund debt–service costs also is assumed to be impermissible in 2010–11, thereby hurting the General Fund’s bottom line by another $400 million.\nIn 2011–12, we assume that Proposition 26 fully reverses the “fuel tax swap” adopted by the Legislature earlier this year, beginning November 2011 (one year after voter approval). Accordingly, state sales taxes on gasoline resume (thereby increasing General Fund revenues), excise taxes on gasoline decline, and the General Fund’s payments for transportation programs resume pursuant to Proposition 42 (2002). A timing lag in Proposition 42 payments means that the net effect of these measures is near zero for 2011–12. The ongoing effect of Propositions 22 and 26—approaching $1 billion or more annually—does not hit the General Fund until 2012–13 in our forecast.\nSome Uncertainty. Propositions 22 and 26 are complex measures. It is possible that some of the fiscal effects we describe above would not materialize until a stakeholder successfully sues the state in court to force these budgetary changes. Accordingly, our forecast presents a preliminary point of view about their effects on the budget. The actual effect may be different in any given fiscal year.\n|\n$6.1 Billion General Fund Deficit Forecast for 2010–11. As shown in Figure 1, given all of these expenditure and revenue issues, we forecast that 2010–11 will end with a General Fund deficit of $6.1 billion, absent any corrective action by the Legislature. Various cash management actions—including payment delays approved by the Legislature and borrowing from both investors and state special funds—will facilitate continued General Fund operations despite the forecasted deficit, as described in the nearby box.\nCash Management\nBackground. As we described in our January 2009 report, California’s Cash Flow Crisis, the state suffers from a basic cash flow problem, even in good years. Most revenues are received during the second half of the fiscal year (January to June), while most expenses are paid in the first half of the fiscal year (July to December). In order to meet payments in the early part of the year, the state obtains short–term borrowing that is paid back within the fiscal year, referred to as revenue anticipation notes (RANs). The state also relies on a pool of “borrowable resources”—balances in state special funds—that can be borrowed for cash flow purposes.\nBillions of Dollars of Payments Delayed in 2010–11. The Legislature enacted two sets of cash payment delays for the 2010–11 fiscal year in order to assist with cash management. The first was enacted in special session legislation and allowed for delays of up to $5 billion of scheduled payments to schools, universities, and local governments at almost any given time within the fiscal year. The second set of delays was enacted in the October budget package and allowed for an additional $4.7 billion of payments to be delayed in October and November in order to avoid the issuance of registered warrants (IOUs) and facilitate the issuance of a 2010–11 RAN. The Controller also used his executive authority to delay other payments in October, such as tax refunds. These various payment delays will be repaid within the 2010–11 fiscal year.\nPayment Delays Will Be Needed for 2011–12. With a few exceptions, there are no statutory provisions for intrayear payment delays in the 2011–12 fiscal year. Given our forecast for the significant deficit at the end of 2010–11 and the accumulated deficit in the General Fund, the state will likely require significant external cash flow borrowing again in 2011–12. In addition, to avoid the issuance of IOUs at certain points in the year, payment delays similar to those approved in 2010–11 likely will be needed. Local governments, schools, and community colleges previously have indicated that early adoption of payment delays helps them execute their own annual cash borrowings.\nCurbing the Deficit Would Reduce Cash Pressures in Future Years. Many temporary or one–time budget solutions—such as borrowing from special funds—increase cash pressures by reducing overall borrowable resources. If the Legislature acts to eliminate operating shortfalls in the coming years, we would expect cash pressures, and hence the need for payment delays, to decline. While removing the payment delays will not have a significant impact on the state’s budget situation, it should reduce the external borrowing costs of local entities and provide more certainty in fiscal planning efforts of schools and community colleges. Reducing cash pressures can also reduce the state’s need for external borrowing, thus reducing the state’s borrowing costs.\n|\nMajor New Budget Problem in 2011–12\nWith the “Carry–In” Deficit, a $25 Billion Problem to Address. The vast majority of the roughly $20 billion of budget solutions enacted as part of the 2010–11 budget process were one–time or temporary in nature. At the same time, by the end of 2010–11 about $8 billion of temporary tax increases expire, and about $4.5 billion of federal stimulus funding used to reduce General Fund expenses will be exhausted. For these reasons, the state will be left with a large operating shortfall (the difference between annual General Fund revenues and expenditures) problem in 2011–12 totaling $19.2 billion. In addition, the Legislature must address the 2010–11 year–end deficit at or before the time it enacts the 2011–12 budget package. Accordingly, the total budget problem that the state must address between now and passage of the 2011–12 budget totals $25.4 billion in our forecast, as shown in Figure 1.\nKey Considerations Regarding the 2011–12 Budget\nSharp Reduction in K–14 Programmatic Spending Already Reflected in Our Forecast. Because of the expiration of temporary tax increases and other factors, General Fund tax revenues are forecast to decline significantly in 2011–12, which drives down the Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantee in our projections. The Proposition 98 minimum guarantee is forecasted to decline from $49.7 billion in 2010–11 (when the Legislature suspended Proposition 98) to $47.5 billion in 2011–12. The General Fund’s share of Proposition 98 funding is forecast to decline as well—from $36.2 billion in 2010–11 to $34.2 billion in 2011–12.\nAt the same time, it is expected that schools will have spent most of the billions of dollars of recent, one–time federal stimulus and jobs funding approved by Congress. Accordingly, it may be very difficult for the Legislature to achieve additional Proposition 98 savings as part of its 2011–12 budget package. In other words, if the Legislature funds schools at the forecasted minimum guarantee in 2011–12, it would mean billions of dollars in programmatic cuts to education but not contribute a single dollar to closing the $25 billion budget problem.\nState Faces Ongoing Constraints on Reducing Health Programs. Our forecast reflects sharp General Fund increases in Medi–Cal, the state’s second–largest General Fund program, that are required under current law and as a result of the expiration of federal economic stimulus funding. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) of 2009 provided an enhanced federal match in state support for Medi–Cal that will be phased out as of the end of 2010–11. The state’s receipt of billions of dollars in federal assistance under ARRA, however, was on the condition that it maintain the eligibility standards, methodologies, and procedures that were previously in place for Medi–Cal. These constraints originally were to expire along with the provision of ARRA funding. However, provisions in the federal health care reform law essentially extended these maintenance–of–effort requirements for Medi–Cal and also applied them to the Healthy Families Program. This essentially takes off the table many options to scale back these programs that could result in several hundreds of millions of dollars in state General Fund savings annually.\nIn other areas, such as California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs), the expiration of federal economic stimulus funding (known as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Emergency Contingency Fund, or TANF ECF) does open up additional options for state savings. The high 80 percent federal matching rate available under TANF ECF for increased CalWORKs grant costs above the state’s base costs in 2007 had been a deterrent to cutting General Fund support for CalWORKs cash assistance, but it is no longer in effect.\nRevenue Uncertainty. As we discuss in Chapter 2, there are a lot of challenges with forecasting economic activity and revenues in California following the unprecedented recession that ended in 2009. One of the key challenges is forecasting capital gains. This is always difficult, but is even more so this year given the huge unrealized stock and housing capital losses of recent years and uncertainties about federal tax policy with the pending expiration of various tax cuts. Action or inaction by Congress on the expiring tax cuts in the coming weeks could affect taxpayer behavior and the resulting timing of hundreds of millions of dollars in state revenues related to capital gains.\nOf perhaps even greater concern is uncertainty about the federal estate tax. Currently, our forecast—like the 2010–11 budget package—assumes $2.7 billion of estate tax revenues for the General Fund in 2010–11 and 2011–12 combined based on current law. There has, however, been significant speculation that Congress will change estate tax law to eliminate the state’s ability to generate any of these revenues. Should Congress do this, the budget problem for 2011–12 would increase by $2.7 billion above the level indicated in our forecast.\nLingering Budget Problem of $20 Billion For Years to Come\nRoughly $20 Billion Annual Problem Forecast Through 2015–16. As shown in Figure 2, our forecast of General Fund revenues and expenditures shows an annual budget problem of around $20 billion through 2015–16. With the econsomic recovery remaining very weak and the lack of many permanent budget solutions in the 2010–11 budget package, the ongoing structural deficit has not changed much since our forecast one year ago. The annual operating shortfall peaks at $22.4 billion in 2012–13, when the state must repay its $2 billion Proposition 1A loan related to local property tax revenues. Thereafter, revenues grow a bit faster than expenditures as the state’s economic recovery becomes stronger. By 2015–16, the annual budget problem is $19.4 billion.\nProjections Likely Understate the State’s Fiscal Woes. We believe that our projections probably understate the magnitude of the state’s fiscal problems during the forecast period. First, our forecast generally assumes no cost–of–living adjustments or inflationary increases in departmental budgets. Second, by including only current–law expenditures, our forecast does not include funding to address a number of large liabilities that pose a risk to future state finances, as discussed below.\nMassive Liabilities Growing. Unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities in pension and retiree health funds for state employees, teachers, and university employees now total $136 billion. (Possible upcoming actions by the state’s two largest pension systems to lower their assumed annual rates of investment return would expand this number.) The California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) estimates that it needs billions of dollars more per year in contributions—not included in our forecast—to retire its unfunded liabilities within about 30 years and continue operations past the 2040s. Similarly, there are no funds assumed in our forecast to begin retiring the University of California Retirement Plan’s (UCRP) growing unfunded liabilities. State retiree health liabilities continue to grow, driving upward the associated General Fund expenditures. The Legislature took action earlier this year to modify state pension programs, providing some budget relief now and greater relief in the future. The unfunded liabilities of state retirement systems, however, loom over the state’s budget prospects. Left unaddressed in the near term, costs to service CalSTRS, UCRP, and retiree health liabilities will only grow, burdening future Californians more and more and requiring even harder decisions about taxes and services. The state should look for ways to address these problems soon, to avoid passing these huge obligations to future Californians.\nMultiyear Approach To Balance the Budget...Beginning Now\nCurrent Budget Problems Hinder Ability to Plan for the Long Term. As discussed throughout this report, California faces immense short–term budget problems and perhaps even more troubling longer–term fiscal challenges. Without immediate action to begin tackling the structural deficit for the long term, the state may not be able in the foreseeable future to move beyond its current stumble from one terrible budget problem to the next. As such, it will continue to be difficult for the state to address fundamental public sector goals—such as rebuilding aging infrastructure, addressing massive retirement liabilities, maintaining service levels of high–priority government programs, and improving the state’s tax system.\nNot Possible to Solve the Whole Problem in One Year. In a state as complex as California, with an economy as weak as the one we have right now, it is not possible to solve this $20 billion ongoing budget problem all at once. The solutions necessary to address the whole problem are probably not obtainable in the current environment. Instead, this problem will take several years to solve. Sound financial planning requires that the state’s leaders agree now to a broad framework for a multiyear approach to tackling the stubborn budget problem.\nMultiyear Approach Requires Real Budget Solutions. The current fiscal year is the third consecutive one that will end with a General Fund deficit. Key contributors to year–end deficits have been enacted budget solutions that have not been achieved. For example, earlier in this chapter we discussed a net $3 billion of 2009–10 and 2010–11 expenditure solutions that are unlikely to be achieved. Year–end deficits have to be “carried in” to the next fiscal year and make the task of balancing the next year’s budget much more difficult. To make progress over several years in tackling the ongoing deficit, the Legislature should minimize the use of risky budget solutions that contribute to year–end deficits. Instead, budget solutions need to be real—by which, we mean those that have a high probability of achieving budgeted savings. The Legislature can maximize the probability of achieving solutions by passing budgets on time (preferably early) and, in the case of spending reductions, providing specific direction and authority to the administration in well–crafted legislation on how reductions are to be realized.\nRevenues Need to Be Part of the Mix. Just as the Legislature will have to prioritize its spending commitments in order to address the ongoing deficit, it will need to examine the revenue side of the ledger. There are several specific revenue policy areas that the Legislature should consider, such as:\n- Tax Expenditure Programs. Through tax expenditure programs—special credits, deductions, and exemptions—the state provides subsidies to certain groups or individuals in ways that often have not been shown to be cost–effective. Their modification or elimination raises revenues without having to increase marginal tax rates.\n- Increasing Charges for Program Beneficiaries. The Legislature should also look to increasing charges in those cases where the costs of state programs currently supported by the General Fund can appropriately be shifted to specific beneficiaries.\n- Extending Certain Temporary Tax Increases. The Legislature may also have to revisit some of the temporary tax increases that are set to expire by the end of 2010–11. We think the best candidates for extension would be the vehicle license fee, where a good policy case can be made to tax vehicles at a rate similar to all other property, and the dependent exemption credit, where the current level is more consistent with the practice of almost all other states.\n- Reconsider the Optional Single Sales Factor. The Legislature may wish to reexamine some corporate tax provisions, such as the existing option of multistate companies to switch annually between the new “single sales factor” method of profit apportionment and the state’s traditional method of apportionment for these companies. Making the single sales factor apportionment mandatory, instead of optional, for multistate companies could increase General Fund revenues and help the state’s competitiveness. (For more information, see our May 2010 report, Reconsidering the Optional Single Sales Factor.)\nBoth Permanent and Temporary Budget Solutions Are Needed in 2011–12. The basic framework we suggest for policy makers to balance the 2011–12 budget would involve a mix of:\n- Permanent, real and ongoing expenditure reductions and revenue increases.\n- Temporary budget solutions, such as short–term revenue or expenditure changes, asset sales, special fund loans and transfers, extended state employee furloughs or personal leave programs, and delays in lower–priority bond–financed infrastructure projects.\nGiven our forecast of a $25 billion budget problem in 2011–12, we suggest that the Legislature and the new Governor target $10 billion of permanent budget solutions in 2011–12 and $15 billion of temporary budget solutions. This would be a “down payment” on the multiyear approach to ending California’s structural deficit.\nIn a Multiyear Approach, More Permanent Solutions Each Year. Figure 3 graphically illustrates—in very simplified form—how a multiyear budget–balancing approach would work, assuming the accuracy of our budget deficit projections, for each fiscal year:\n- 2012–13. By taking $10 billion of permanent budget actions in 2011–12, the size of the 2012–13 budget problem we forecast might be reduced from $22 billion to $12 billion. In 2012–13, the Legislature could address the budget problem with about $3 billion of new additional permanent actions (or the growth in savings from previously adopted solutions) and $9 billion of temporary actions.\n- 2013–14. Adding together the effects of the permanent budget–balancing actions in 2011–12 and 2012–13, the budget problem we forecast for 2013–14 could be reduced from $20 billion to around $7 billion. The Legislature could address this problem with $3 billion of new additional permanent actions and around $4 billion of temporary actions.\n- 2014–15. The prior permanent budget actions would reduce the 2014–15 budget problem from $20 billion to about $4 billion. Roughly another $3 billion of new, permanent budget actions could be adopted, along with $1 billion of temporary solutions.\n- 2015–16. In this simplified scenario, there would no longer be a structural deficit facing the state in 2015–16 due to the accumulated effects of the permanent budget actions passed in the previous four years.\nNaturally, the real work of balancing the budget would not be this simple. This scenario assumes that our revenue and expenditure forecast assumptions are correct, ignores the interaction between any increased revenues and Proposition 98 funding requirements, and assumes that no temporary budget–balancing actions—such as borrowing—increase costs (and deficits) in later years. The basic concept we offer, however, is that the Legislature can earnestly “chip away” at the budget problem, but only by beginning to enact permanent and real solutions to reduce spending and increase revenues.\nThe solutions needed to balance the budget will mean unavoidably painful sacrifice by today’s Californians. The benefit of this sacrifice would be putting the state on a sound fiscal footing. That sound footing may allow future Californians to live in a place where the annual state budget process is a chance to improve government’s ability to serve its residents.\nChapter 2\nEconomy, Revenues, and Demographics\nThe Economic Outlook\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research has determined that the national recession that began in December 2007 ended in June 2009. It was the longest recession since World War II and the most severe downturn since the Great Depression The 2007–2009 recession was precipitated by the implosion of overheated housing markets in California and throughout the United States, the resulting balance sheet deterioration of financial firms and households, and the near collapse of world credit markets.\nCalifornia’s recession started even earlier than the nation’s and was deeper. Unemployment in the state—under 5 percent as recently as 2006—has topped 12 percent for over a year now, as 1.4 million jobs have disappeared. In 2009, personal income in California dropped 2.4 percent—the first annual decline since 1933.\nSlow Recovery Expected to Continue. The latest evidence suggests that the state and national economies continue their very slow recovery from this staggering economic drop–off. Our economic forecast—summarized in Figure 1—generally reflects the current consensus that the state and national economies will continue to recover slowly and sluggishly in the coming years.\nFigure 1\nThe LAO’s Economic Forecast\n(November 2010)\n|\n|\nActual\n|\nEstimated\n|\n|\nForecast\n|\n|\n|\n2009\n|\n2010\n|\n|\n2011\n|\n2012\n|\n2013\n|\n2014\n|\n2015\n|\n2016\n|\n|\nUnited States\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nPercent change in:\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nReal Gross Domestic Product\n|\n–2.6%\n|\n2.6%\n|\n|\n2.2%\n|\n3.1%\n|\n2.9%\n|\n2.8%\n|\n3.1%\n|\n2.8%\n|\n|\nPersonal Income\n|\n–1.7\n|\n2.8\n|\n|\n3.2\n|\n3.9\n|\n4.3\n|\n5.5\n|\n5.4\n|\n5.7\n|\n|\nWage and Salary Employment\n|\n–4.3\n|\n–0.5\n|\n|\n0.9\n|\n2.2\n|\n2.2\n|\n1.5\n|\n1.4\n|\n1.2\n|\n|\nConsumer Price Index\n|\n–0.3\n|\n1.6\n|\n|\n1.6\n|\n1.9\n|\n2.0\n|\n2.1\n|\n2.1\n|\n2.1\n|\n|\nUnemployment Rate (percent)\n|\n9.3\n|\n9.7\n|\n|\n9.6\n|\n9.1\n|\n8.3\n|\n7.9\n|\n7.3\n|\n6.9\n|\n|\nHousing Permits (thousands)\n|\n554\n|\n596\n|\n|\n789\n|\n1,243\n|\n1,465\n|\n1,565\n|\n1,689\n|\n1,686\n|\n|\nCalifornia\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nPercent change in:\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nPersonal Income\n|\n–2.4\n|\n2.8\n|\n|\n3.5\n|\n4.3\n|\n4.8\n|\n5.7\n|\n5.9\n|\n5.7\n|\n|\nWage and Salary Employment\n|\n–6.0\n|\n–1.7\n|\n|\n0.7\n|\n2.2\n|\n2.4\n|\n1.8\n|\n2.0\n|\n1.3\n|\n|\nConsumer Price Index\n|\n–0.4\n|\n1.6\n|\n|\n1.6\n|\n1.9\n|\n2.0\n|\n2.1\n|\n2.1\n|\n2.1\n|\n|\nUnemployment Rate (percent)\n|\n11.4\n|\n12.5\n|\n|\n11.9\n|\n10.5\n|\n9.1\n|\n8.2\n|\n7.1\n|\n6.6\n|\n|\nHousing Permits (thousands)\n|\n34\n|\n42\n|\n|\n67\n|\n79\n|\n99\n|\n113\n|\n121\n|\n121\n|\nThe U.S. Economy\nSlower Recovery Than Previously Expected. Our recent economic forecasts already assumed a slow recovery, compared to past economic rebounds. Following the deep 1981–82 recession, for example, the U.S. economy bounced right back—with real gross domestic product (GDP) growing 4.5 percent in 1983 and 7.2 percent in 1984. Our updated forecast, by contrast, assumes that real GDP growth will be 2.6 percent in 2010, 2.2 percent in 2011, and no higher than 3.1 percent in any of the years between now and 2016. (Figure 2 summarizes our forecasts of quarterly changes in GDP.) Unemployment—now 9.6 percent nationally—is forecast to remain above 9 percent through 2012. Our forecasts of U.S. economic growth in 2011 and 2012 are somewhat lower than our forecasts from the past year.\nWhat Is Causing the Slow Recovery? The slow recovery results from a combination of (1) excess inventories of residential and commercial real estate, (2) severely depressed economic confidence among both individuals and firms, and (3) for many consumers, a considerably weakened financial capacity to spend and invest. Consumers are attempting to restore their personal finances amidst the weak labor markets and diminished housing wealth. Credit remains very tight. While businesses have been spending more in recent quarters to address equipment, software, and other needs they deferred during the recession, they remain very reluctant to hire. The construction industry remains flat on its back—with few immediate prospects—due to the massive fall in residential and commercial real estate markets. While massive fiscal stimulus from the federal government helped cushion the fall, the 2009 stimulus program spending will taper off in the coming quarters, and the likelihood that Congress will enact additional fiscal stimulus appears remote. The Federal Reserve continues to take actions to stimulate the economy, but, with interest rates already at very low levels, its ability to achieve much in this regard is limited.\n“Double–Dip” Recession Not Likely. While our economic and revenue forecasts reflect very modest assumptions about near–term growth, they are by no means a worst–case scenario. A minority of economic commentators have suggested that a double–dip recession—another period of diminished economic output—is possible due to the coming declines of federal economic stimulus, continued weakness in consumer spending, turmoil in the world’s sovereign debt and currency markets, and other factors. Our forecast reflects the consensus view that a double–dip recession will not occur. While employment, personal income, output, and housing permit growth, among other measures, are very weak by historical standards during a recovery, they are not shrinking. Similarly, while we expect low inflation through 2015–16, we do not forecast a period of deflation in the U.S. economy. In large part, our economic outlook reflects the view that some key economic measures (such as construction activity) have fallen so far that there is little room to fall even more.\nThe California Economy\nEmployment Losses Subsiding. While U.S. employment has dropped about 5 percent since 2007, employment in California has declined 9 percent (1.4 million jobs). In 2010, however, the level of job losses in the state has been subsiding—a trend we expect to continue. We forecast that California will begin to experience a net increase in employment again in early 2011, causing unemployment to creep below 12 percent later in the calendar year. We expect employment in the state to grow by only about 100,000 jobs during 2011—a slower level of job growth for the year than in any of our recent forecasts. In 2012, we project slow employment growth in the state, a trend that should keep unemployment at or above 10 percent for much of that year. Growth in later years also remains fairly sluggish, as shown in Figure 3. Total employment in California does not return to its 2007 pre–recession levels in our forecast until 2016.\nHousing Weakness Casts Formidable Shadow Over Economy. The main cause of the economic implosion of recent years has been the housing market. For now, at least, the collapse of California’s residential housing sector appears to have ended. As depicted in Figure 4, however, our forecast for California housing prices shows a very weak recovery—with minimal average gains in prices through 2016. While house prices now are more affordable—particularly in light of low mortgage interest rates—credit remains very tight. A large (but difficult to measure) “hidden inventory” of homes in default or facing foreclosure heavily influences our forecast. While residential building permits are up in 2010, they are still below 2008 levels—which, at the time, was the worst year in recent memory. Our forecast, as shown in Figure 1, expects housing permits to continue to grow slowly. Commercial building also continues to be exceptionally weak. For all of these reasons, California’s construction sector—having endured a crushing 40 percent employment decline since 2007—is not on track to regain its pre–recession strength in the foreseeable future.\nPersonal Income Poised to Rise With Job Growth. As job growth resumes, personal income in the state rebounds in our forecast—first, fairly slowly in 2011 and 2012, and then with some increasing strength thereafter. By 2014, we expect annual personal income growth for California in the 5.7 percent to 5.9 percent range—a level consistent with what we would consider a healthy growth rate for the state in the long run. Gradually climbing interest rates contribute to much stronger growth in dividends, interest, and rent income in the later years of our forecast. Government benefits also grow in the later years of our forecast, buoyed by growth in the aging “baby boom” population and, to some extent, the implementation of federal health care reform. All of these factors should help households in California continue to repair their finances, boost consumer confidence, and contribute to several years of increased consumption.\nRevenue Projections\nCalifornia’s General Fund is supported by revenues from a variety of taxes, fees, licenses, interest earnings, loans, and transfers from other state funds. About 90 percent of the total, however, is derived from the state’s “big three” taxes—the personal income tax (PIT), the sales and use tax (SUT), and the corporate income and franchise tax (CT). A summary of our revenue projections is shown in Figure 5.\nFigure 5\nLAO General Fund Revenue Forecast\n(Dollars in Millions)\n|\nRevenue Source\n|\n2009–10\n|\n2010–11\n|\n2011–12\n|\n2012–13\n|\n2013–14\n|\n2014–15\n|\n2015–16\n|\n|\nPersonal income tax\n|\n$44,575\n|\n$46,731\n|\n$44,252\n|\n$47,909\n|\n$50,868\n|\n$54,072\n|\n$57,507\n|\n|\nSales and use tax\n|\n26,741\n|\n27,310\n|\n25,370\n|\n27,725\n|\n29,137\n|\n30,397\n|\n31,622\n|\n|\nCorporation tax\n|\n9,500\n|\n10,418\n|\n8,567\n|\n8,125\n|\n8,531\n|\n9,255\n|\n9,963\n|\n|\nSubtotal, “Big Three”\n|\n($80,816)\n|\n($84,460)\n|\n($78,189)\n|\n($83,760)\n|\n($88,536)\n|\n($93,724)\n|\n($99,092)\n|\n|\nPercent change\n|\n5.4%\n|\n4.5%\n|\n–7.4%\n|\n7.1%\n|\n5.7%\n|\n5.9%\n|\n5.7%\n|\n|\nInsurance tax\n|\n$2,020\n|\n$2,033\n|\n$2,060\n|\n$2,093\n|\n$2,129\n|\n$2,168\n|\n$2,223\n|\n|\nVehicle license fee\n|\n1,380\n|\n1,428\n|\n159\n|\n34\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n|\nEstate tax\n|\n—\n|\n850\n|\n1,838\n|\n1,988\n|\n2,150\n|\n2,325\n|\n2,515\n|\n|\nSales of fixed assets\n|\n—\n|\n1,286\n|\n1\n|\n1\n|\n1\n|\n7\n|\n7\n|\n|\nOther revenues\n|\n2,378\n|\n2,205\n|\n2,136\n|\n1,861\n|\n2,072\n|\n2,233\n|\n2,342\n|\n|\nNet transfers and loans\n|\n447\n|\n1,021\n|\n–853\n|\n–1,014\n|\n–180\n|\n21\n|\n18\n|\n|\nTotal Revenues and Transfers\n|\n$87,041\n|\n$93,283\n|\n$83,530\n|\n$88,723\n|\n$94,708\n|\n$100,478\n|\n$106,197\n|\n|\nPercent change\n|\n5.2%\n|\n7.2%\n|\n–10.5%\n|\n6.2%\n|\n6.7%\n|\n6.1%\n|\n5.7%\n|\nFigure 6 shows the differences between our forecasts of 2009–10 and 2010–11 revenues, as compared with those assumed in the 2010–11 budget package. For 2009–10 and 2010–11 combined, we now project that the big three and other revenues will be $447 million below the budget package assumptions. In addition, due to our assumption that passage of Proposition 22 will prevent the borrowing of some transportation funds, our net transfer and loans forecast is $378 million lower. In total, for 2009–10 and 2010–11 combined, our revenue and transfer forecast is $826 million below that assumed in the 2010–11 budget package.\nFigure 6\nNovember 2010 LAO Revenue Estimates Compared With 2010–11 Budget Package\n(General Fund, In Millions)\n|\nRevenue Source\n|\n2009–10\n|\n|\n2010–11\n|\n|\nLAO November Forecast\n|\nBudget Package\n|\nDifference\n|\nLAO November Forecast\n|\nBudget Package\n|\nDifference\n|\n|\nPersonal income tax\n|\n$44,575\n|\n$44,820\n|\n–$245\n|\n|\n$46,731\n|\n$47,127\n|\n–$396\n|\n|\nSales and use tax\n|\n26,741\n|\n26,618\n|\n123\n|\n|\n27,310\n|\n27,044\n|\n266\n|\n|\nCorporation tax\n|\n9,500\n|\n9,275\n|\n225\n|\n|\n10,418\n|\n10,897\n|\n–479\n|\n|\nSubtotal, “Big Three”\n|\n($80,816)\n|\n($80,713)\n|\n($103)\n|\n($84,460)\n|\n($85,068)\n|\n(–$608)\n|\n|\nOther revenues\n|\n$5,778\n|\n$5,760\n|\n$18\n|\n|\n$7,802\n|\n$7,762\n|\n$40\n|\n|\nNet transfers and loans\n|\n447\n|\n447\n|\n—\n|\n|\n1,021\n|\n1,399\n|\n–378\n|\n|\nTotal Revenues and Transfers\n|\n$87,041\n|\n$86,920\n|\n$121\n|\n$93,283\n|\n$94,230\n|\n–$947\n|\nPersonal Income Tax\nEnd of Temporary Tax Increases Affects 2011–12 Forecast. We estimate that PIT revenue will increase from its 2009–10 level of $44.6 billion to $46.7 billion in 2010–11. It will then drop off to $44.3 billion in 2011–12 as the temporary 0.25 percentage point rate increase and dependent credit reduction enacted in February 2009 expire at the end of calendar year 2010. These temporary tax increases contribute over $2 billion to PIT revenues in 2010–11. We project PIT collections to increase steadily in the out years as the economy continues to recover, but we do not expect collections to exceed their 2007–08 level of $54.2 billion until 2015–16.\nPIT Forecast Marked by Capital Gains, Federal Tax Uncertainties. Capital gains are important for PIT projections because these gains are concentrated among taxpayers who pay the highest marginal PIT tax rates. As Figure 7 shows, capital gains fluctuate wildly relative to personal income depending on the state of asset markets, and this always makes them difficult to forecast. They peaked at $120 billion in tax year 2000 at the height of the dot–com bubble but fell to $33 billion in 2002. Similarly, capital gains peaked at $132 billion at the height of the housing bubble in 2007, only to fall to $56 billion in 2008. We estimate that capital gains fell further to $34 billion in 2009. Our forecast reflects modest future growth in capital gains through 2016 due to improving stock prices and slowly increasing real estate values. If our forecast is off, this could have a significant effect on PIT collections and General Fund revenues. For example, for each $10 billion increase in capital gains, General Fund revenues increase by approximately $800 million.\nCurrently, there are two big variables that makes us particularly uncertain about capital gains. First, there is a large stock of unused losses. Taxpayers racked up far more capital losses than they could claim on returns in 2008 and probably again in 2009. Accordingly, we expect that these unused losses will hinder revenue growth for many years as taxpayers use 2008 and 2009 losses to offset future gains.\nSecond, there is significant tax policy uncertainty at the federal level regarding congressional action on expiring tax cuts. In 2001 and 2003, lower tax rates, including capital gains tax rates, were adopted, and these federal tax rate reductions are to expire this year. Our forecast assumes that this higher federal tax rate on capital gains returns to its higher level in 2011. This would cause some taxpayers to take gains in 2010 that otherwise would be taken in 2011. The actions Congress takes could affect the timing of these capital gain receipts and other economic and revenue variables in different ways. It seems as though the federal tax picture will be somewhat clearer by the time the new Governor releases his budget proposal in January.\nSales and Use Tax\nEnd of Temporary Tax Increase and Proposition 26 Affect 2011–12 Forecast. In 2010–11, we expect SUT receipts of $27.3 billion, a 2.1 percent increase over the prior year. The 1 percent temporary SUT rate increase adopted in 2009—which contributes $4.7 billion of SUT revenue in 2010–11—will expire on June 30, 2011. For 2011–12, SUT revenues are projected to fall to $25.7 billion, reflecting the net effect of this rate drop, projected growth in the SUT taxable sales base of nearly 7 percent, and our assumption that voter approval of Proposition 26 on November 2, 2010 will undo the “fuel tax swap” adopted earlier this year. Under the terms of that measure, the gasoline sales tax is reinstated in November 2011, thereby also increasing General Fund spending on transportation. After 2011–12, taxable sales are expected to grow by 4 percent to 7 percent annually.\nTaxable Sales Bottomed Out Last Year and Now Are Recovering. The main determinant of SUT receipts is taxable sales. About two–thirds of taxable sales result from retail spending by consumers, including a significant portion on light vehicles and trucks. Other important categories of taxable sales are the purchase of building materials involved in new construction and business–to–business transactions, where a business is the item’s final consumer. Taxable sales in California appear to have hit bottom in the second half of 2009, and are bouncing back.\nAs shown in Figure 8, overall consumer spending remains low relative to the levels of recent decades, when viewed as a percentage of personal income. It appears there has been a long–term trend toward lower taxable sales, relative to personal income, which has been influenced by: (1) the major recessions of the early 1990s and 2007–2009; (2) a trend toward more consumption of nontaxable services and other products (such as those purchased online, for which the collection of sales and use taxes is more difficult); and (3) increased household savings, particularly in the last few years.\nCorporate Tax\nCorporate Tax Forecast to Bottom Out in 2012–13 Before Rebounding. The CT receipts for 2009–10 are estimated to have totaled $9.5 billion, virtually unchanged from the previous fiscal year. Due to the slow recovery and policy changes enacted by the Legislature, we project CT receipts will fall sharply in 2011–12 and 2012–13. The tax bottoms out in 2012–13 at around $8 billion before rebounding back to around $10 billion by 2015–16.\nCorporate Profit Rebound Does Not Necessarily Translate Into Higher Revenues. The main factor underlying CT receipts is the level of corporate profits that California taxes. California’s corporate profits, in turn, reflect the economic conditions facing Californians, as well as national and international economic conditions. At times, higher profits do not fully translate into higher CT receipts because these higher profits also make it possible for businesses to use more deductions and credits. Precise data on California taxable profits for 2009 and 2010 are not yet available, but our forecast assumes that corporate profits hit bottom in 2008–09 and rebounded rapidly in 2009–10. Profits in the final years of our forecast grow at about 5 percent each year.\nPolicy Changes Reduce Long–Term Revenues. Policy changes made over the past few years have significant impacts on corporate tax receipts over the forecast period. As shown in Figure 9, increases of CT receipts due to policy changes negated what otherwise would have been a significant reduction in CT receipts in 2009–10. Recent tax policy changes also will boost receipts in 2010–11 by increasing collections by a net amount of around $1 billion. For the remainder of the forecast period, however, these same policy changes diminish CT receipts by between $1 billion and $2 billion each year. The major policy changes affecting the forecast include:\n- Changes in Multistate Business Taxation. The elective single sales factor—the new option for businesses to annually choose which method is used to determine California taxable income—and associated tax law changes are estimated to reduce General Fund CT revenues by up to $1 billion per year within a few years.\n- Revenue Accelerations. The Legislature has enacted several measures over the last couple of years that will allow the state to collect revenues earlier and delay the use of tax deductions or credits. The accelerations include the suspensions, for 2008 through 2011, of larger businesses’ use of net operating loss deductions. Recently enacted penalties on corporate taxpayers who are found to have significantly underpaid their taxes also serve to accelerate CT collections. This occurs as businesses try to avoid the penalties by paying upfront some of the tax they might have been forced to pay later following an audit. In addition, legislation limited the amount of tax credits a corporation could use in 2008 and 2009 to 50 percent of its tax liability for those years. This boosted near–term receipts but leads to increased use of those credits in 2010 and beyond. These changes, collectively, are estimated to bring in around $1.2 billion in 2010–11 but have the effect of decreasing CT revenues after 2011–12.\n- Expanded Credit Use. Recent legislation also affected the use of tax credits. Changes in this area include the creation of new temporary tax credits for qualified employment and film production. Also, credits are now easier to use under a law that allows transfers of certain credits between companies that are treated as parts of a single unit for tax purposes. These changes reduce revenues by up to $500 million per year throughout the forecast period.\nOther Revenues and Transfers\nEstate Tax Highly Uncertain and Could Swell 2011–12 Problem by $2.7 Billion. Above, we discussed how congressional action in the coming months could affect capital gains and PIT receipts. In addition, congressional action or inaction on estate taxes could significantly affect the state’s ability to receive any of the $850 million of current–law estate tax receipts we project for 2010–11 (a half–year of receipts), as well as around $2 billion of annual receipts in each subsequent year of the forecast. As we discussed in prior reports, a 2002 federal law phased out estate taxes so that, by 2010, the estate tax was eliminated entirely. In 2011, this provision sunsets so that estate tax laws revert back to 2001 law—which means that tax rates would return to 2001 levels and the state pickup tax is restored. This pickup tax reduces federal estate taxes by the amount of state taxes levied on each estate, up to a certain level. As a result, many states—including California—set state tax levels at the maximum exemption level under federal law. There have been considerable efforts in recent years to change this current federal law to permanently limit both the federal and state estate tax. If Congress were to act to change the federal law, it appears there is a good chance the pickup tax exemption would not be restored. In this event, the 2011–12 budget problem would increase by $2.7 billion (recognizing the effects of both the half–year projected estate tax receipts of $850 million in 2010–11 and the first full year of receipts projected to be $1.8 billion in 2011–12). Later budget problems would grow by up to $2 billion per year above our forecast. (These amounts do not account for any Proposition 98 interactions.)\nFixed Asset Sales Slightly Above Enacted Budget Forecast in 2010–11. Assuming that recently announced sales of state office buildings and the Orange County Fairgrounds proceed as planned, our forecast projects $1.3 billion of one–time General Fund revenue in 2010–11. This total is about $100 million higher than assumed in the 2010–11 budget package.\nEnd of Temporary Vehicle License Fee (VLF) Increase Affects 2011–12 Forecast. The temporary VLF increase enacted as part of the 2009–10 budget package expires at the end of 2010–11. This temporary increase generates $1.4 billion of revenue for the General Fund in 2010–11. Thereafter, the General Fund VLF rate declines again to zero in our forecast, although small amounts of VLF payments trickle in during subsequent fiscal years due to late payments. Figure 10 summarizes the VLF and other revenues that the state has received from the temporary tax package.\nFigure 10\nEstimated Revenues From Temporary Tax Increases Enacted as Part of the 2009–10 Budget Package\n(In Billions)\n|\n|\n2008–09\n|\n2009–10\n|\n2010–11\n|\n|\nSales and use tax—1 percentage point increase\n|\n$1.1\n|\n$4.4\n|\n$4.7\n|\n|\nPersonal income tax—dependent credit decrease\n|\n0.1\n|\n1.2\n|\n1.1\n|\n|\nPersonal income tax—0.25 percentage point increase\n|\n0.8\n|\n1.8\n|\n1.0\n|\n|\nVehicle license fee—0.5 percentage point increase\n|\n0.2\n|\n1.4\n|\n1.4\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n$2.2\n|\n$8.7\n|\n$8.3\n|\nSpecial Fund Loans Dominate the General Fund Transfers Forecast. In addition to tax, fee, and other revenues, the General Fund receives transfers from the state’s special funds and transfers money out to those same special funds. During the forecast period, the state’s transfers are to be dominated by loans received from special funds (the major component of the $1.4 billion of net transfers assumed in the budget package for 2010–11) and loan principal repayments back to special funds ($853 million of projected net transfers out in 2011–12, $1 billion in 2012–13, and $180 million in 2013–14). Our forecast assumes that approval of Proposition 22 on November 2, 2010 eliminates the possibility of the state borrowing $378 million of funds from transportation accounts assumed in the 2010–11 budget package. This reduces net transfers and loans in 2010–11 to $1 billion in our projections.\nDemographic Projections\nDepartment of Finance (DOF) Population Estimates Differ From Census Estimates. The DOF estimates that California’s July 1, 2009 population was 38.5 million and that the state’s population increased by 1 percent (or greater) in each year between 2001 and 2008 and by 0.93 percent in 2009. By contrast, the Census Bureau—in its annual estimates released prior to next year’s release of 2010 Census data—believed that California’s July 1, 2009 population was 37.0 million. The Census estimates differ from DOF’s because they assume that California’s net annual population growth rate has been somewhat under 1 percent in several years during the past decade. Data from the 2010 Census to be released in March 2011 should help resolve this demographic dispute.\nEconomic Downturn Probably Has Resulted in Fewer Newcomers. Relatively poor economic performance in California can make it less attractive for residents of other state and countries to migrate here. Based on historical experience, our population model suggests that the recent trend of Californians leaving the state probably is accelerating and will continue to do so through 2011. At the same time, the economic downturn will depress net international migration into California for the next several years. Births increase slowly as women continue to delay childbirth until later ages. Accordingly, as shown in Figure 11, our office estimates that total annual population growth in California will be 0.55 percent in 2010 and projects that population growth will be under 1 percent annually through 2015.\nFigure 11\nLAO’s California Demographic Forecasta\n(In Thousands)\n|\n|\n2009a\n|\n2010\n|\n|\n2011\n|\n2012\n|\n2013\n|\n2014\n|\n2015\n|\n2016\n|\n|\nTotals (July 1st)\n|\n38,488\n|\n38,699\n|\n|\n38,863\n|\n39,137\n|\n39,453\n|\n39,803\n|\n40,191\n|\n40,643\n|\n|\nPercent change\n|\n0.93%\n|\n0.55%\n|\n|\n0.43%\n|\n0.70%\n|\n0.81%\n|\n0.89%\n|\n0.98%\n|\n1.12%\n|\n|\nChange in population:\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nBirths\n|\n553\n|\n548\n|\n|\n527\n|\n526\n|\n534\n|\n542\n|\n549\n|\n557\n|\n|\nDeaths\n|\n–237\n|\n–236\n|\n|\n–241\n|\n–245\n|\n–249\n|\n–253\n|\n–257\n|\n–261\n|\n|\nNet domestic migration\n|\n–173\n|\n–190\n|\n|\n–225\n|\n–121\n|\n–98\n|\n–85\n|\n–54\n|\n–12\n|\n|\nNet foreign migration\n|\n210\n|\n89\n|\n|\n104\n|\n114\n|\n130\n|\n145\n|\n152\n|\n167\n|\n|\nNet Change\n|\n353\n|\n211\n|\n|\n165\n|\n274\n|\n316\n|\n349\n|\n389\n|\n451\n|\nBaby Boomers Will Swell Over–65 Population. Baby boomers born immediately after the end of World War II began to reach the age of 65 earlier this year. As this huge population cohort continues to reach this age, this group will swell in the coming years. We project the over–65 population generally will grow over 4 percent per year throughout our forecast period.\nModest Growth for K–12 and College–Age Population Groups. Our forecast assumes the K–12 population grows by 0.2 percent or less through 2013–14 before increasing slightly more rapidly. The 18–24 college age group is projected to increase very modestly through 2013 before beginning to decline thereafter. During the forecast period, this college–aged group largely consists of the offspring of the relatively small “Generation X”—those born in the two decades after the baby boom.\nChapter 3\nExpenditure Projections\nIn this chapter, we discuss our General Fund expenditure estimates for 2009–10 and 2010–11, as well as our projections for 2011–12 through 2015–16. Figure 1 shows our forecast for major General Fund spending categories for all of these years. Below, we first discuss projected general budgetary trends and then discuss in more detail our expenditure projections for individual major program areas.\nFigure 1\nProjected General Fund Spending for Major Programs\n(Dollars in Millions)\n|\n|\nEstimates\n|\n|\nForecast\n|\nAverage Annual\nGrowth From\n2011–12 to\n2015–16\n|\n|\n2009–10\n|\n2010–11\n|\n2011–12\n|\n2012–13\n|\n2013–14\n|\n2014–15\n|\n2015–16\n|\n|\nEducation\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nK–14–Proposition 98\n|\n$35,669\n|\n$36,209\n|\n|\n$34,184\n|\n$36,733\n|\n$38,847\n|\n$41,058\n|\n$43,270\n|\n6.1%\n|\n|\nProposition 98 QEIA and Settle–Up\n|\n300a\n|\n—a\n|\n|\n750\n|\n750\n|\n750\n|\n750\n|\n472\n|\n–10.9\n|\n|\nCSU\n|\n2,288\n|\n2,433\n|\n|\n2,646\n|\n2,646\n|\n2,646\n|\n2,646\n|\n2,646\n|\n—\n|\n|\nUC\n|\n2,449\n|\n2,711\n|\n|\n2,815\n|\n2,815\n|\n2,815\n|\n2,815\n|\n2,815\n|\n—\n|\n|\nStudent Aid Commission\n|\n1,019\n|\n1,079\n|\n|\n1,258\n|\n1,334\n|\n1,413\n|\n1,499\n|\n1,609\n|\n6.4\n|\n|\nHealth and Social Services\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nMedi–Cal\n|\n10,136\n|\n12,595\n|\n|\n17,642\n|\n18,831\n|\n20,291\n|\n22,101\n|\n23,976\n|\n8.0\n|\n|\nCalWORKs\n|\n1,995\n|\n2,143\n|\n|\n3,041\n|\n3,140\n|\n3,130\n|\n2,960\n|\n2,676\n|\n–3.1\n|\n|\nSSI/SSP\n|\n2,951\n|\n2,954\n|\n|\n3,033\n|\n3,116\n|\n3,200\n|\n3,287\n|\n3,379\n|\n2.7\n|\n|\nIHSS\n|\n1,488\n|\n1,419\n|\n|\n1,732\n|\n1,835\n|\n1,903\n|\n1,973\n|\n2,045\n|\n4.2\n|\n|\nDevelopmental Services\n|\n2,420\n|\n2,541\n|\n|\n3,124\n|\n3,292\n|\n3,473\n|\n3,671\n|\n3,885\n|\n5.6\n|\n|\nMental Health\n|\n1,666\n|\n1,837\n|\n|\n2,142\n|\n2,193\n|\n2,247\n|\n2,305\n|\n2,367\n|\n2.5\n|\n|\nOther major programsb\n|\n3,185\n|\n2,823\n|\n|\n3,327\n|\n3,460\n|\n3,518\n|\n3,457\n|\n3,751\n|\n3.1\n|\n|\nCorrections and Rehabilitation\n|\n7,718\n|\n9,281\n|\n|\n9,034\n|\n9,124\n|\n9,371\n|\n9,546\n|\n9,792\n|\n2.0\n|\n|\nJudiciary\n|\n419\n|\n1,649\n|\n|\n2,016\n|\n2,013\n|\n2,012\n|\n2,012\n|\n2,012\n|\n—\n|\n|\nProposition 1A Loan Costs\n|\n15\n|\n91\n|\n|\n91\n|\n1,986\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n|\nInfrastructure Debt Servicec\n|\n5,383\n|\n5,752\n|\n|\n6,926\n|\n7,239\n|\n8,378\n|\n8,848\n|\n8,705\n|\n5.9\n|\n|\nOther Programs/Costs\n|\n7,934\n|\n6,988\n|\n|\n8,995\n|\n10,658\n|\n11,155\n|\n11,755\n|\n12,230\n|\n8.0\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n5.2%\n|\n|\nPercent Change\n|\n|\n6.3%\n|\n|\n11.1%\n|\n8.2%\n|\n3.6%\n|\n4.8%\n|\n4.1%\n|\n|\nGeneral Fund Budget Trends\n2010–11 Outlook\nGeneral Fund expenditures in 2010–11 are billions of dollars below their normal levels due to one–time or temporary actions, including (1) billions of dollars in federal stimulus funds received, (2) suspension of Proposition 98, and (3) funding shifts to non–General Fund sources. However, General Fund expenditures are forecast to increase from $87 billion in 2009–10 to $92.5 billion in 2010–11—an increase of 6.3 percent. This is much more than the budgeted increase of 0.2 percent that was expected when the budget was passed in October—due principally to our projection that a significant amount (around $3.5 billion) of assumed federal funds will not be secured. In addition, we project that several major programs—such as the prison system, In–Home Supportive Services (IHSS), and employee compensation—will be unable to achieve the full amount of budgeted reductions.\nExpenditure Growth During the Forecast Period\nSharp Growth in 2011–12 as One–Time Savings Measures Expire. In 2011–12, our forecast shows General Fund spending climbing by 11 percent. This is principally the result of billions of dollars of one–time saving measures expiring. For example, Medi–Cal expenditures will increase by about $5 billion—the majority of this is due to expiring federal funds.\nLower Growth Projected After 2011–12. Our forecast shows General Fund spending growing by 8.2 percent in 2012–13, 3.6 percent in 2013–14, 4.8 percent in 2014–15, and 4.1 percent in 2015–16. As shown in Figure 1, this equates to an average annual growth rate of 5.2 percent between 2011–12 and 2015–16—slightly higher than the forecasted rate of personal income growth in the state during that period. The period is characterized by consistently high rates of growth in two areas that represent over half of the General Fund budget in 2015–16: (1) Proposition 98 spending for K–14 education, and (2) Medi–Cal. Although Proposition 98 spending for K–14 education is forecasted to drop in 2011–12, spending over the following years averages 6 percent annual growth as the economy continues its expected recovery. The largest growth in our forecast (8 percent) occurs in Medi–Cal due to growth in caseload and health care costs and, in the last two years of the forecast, the impact of federal health care reform. The remainder of the budget is forecast to grow at a modest 3.5 percent over the forecast period. This modest growth is due in part to the stated legislative policy of having no automatic cost–of–living adjustments (COLAs) or inflation adjustment for programs (as discussed in Chapter 1). For instance, our forecast shows no growth in General Fund appropriations to the universities or the courts after 2011–12.\nProposition 98—K–14 Education\nState budgeting for K–14 education is governed largely by Proposition 98, passed by the voters in 1988. The measure, later modified by Proposition 111 in 1990, establishes a minimum funding requirement, commonly referred to as the “minimum guarantee,” for K–14 education. Both state General Fund and local property tax revenues apply toward meeting the minimum guarantee. Proposition 98 monies support child care, preschool, K–12 education, and the California Community Colleges—accounting for about 70 percent of total funding for these programs. (K–14 education funding also comes from the federal government, other state sources, and various local sources.)\nCalculating the Minimum Guarantee. The Proposition 98 minimum guarantee is determined by one of three tests set forth in the Constitution. These tests are based on several inputs, including changes in K–12 average daily attendance, per capita personal income, and per capita General Fund revenue. Though the calculation of the minimum guarantee is formula driven, a supermajority of the Legislature can override the formulas and provide less funding than the formulas require. This happened in 2010–11, with the Legislature suspending Proposition 98 and providing less funding than otherwise required. As a result of the suspension, the state created an out–year Proposition 98 obligation referred to as a “maintenance factor.” When growth in state General Fund revenues is healthier (as determined by a specific formula set forth in the Constitution), the state is required to provide additional funding (make a maintenance factor payment) to build up K–14 funding to the level it otherwise would have been absent the earlier reduction. In essence, the maintenance factor allows the state to attain near–term savings without affecting the long–run level of K–14 support.\nProposition 98 Forecast\nMinimum Guarantee Drops in 2011–12 Before Rebounding. The top part of Figure 2 shows our projections of the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee throughout the forecast period. For 2011–12, we project the minimum guarantee will be about $2 billion lower than the 2010–11 spending level due to the expiration of tax increases that temporarily raised tax revenues in 2009–10 and 2010–11. For the rest of the forecast period, we project steady increases in the minimum guarantee of $2 billion to $3 billion each year. Local property tax revenues modestly grow each year of the forecast period. In the last year of the forecast period, we project the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee and local property tax revenues would finally be higher than their pre–recession levels.\nFigure 2\nProposition 98 Forecast\n(Dollars in Millions)\n|\n|\n2010–11\n|\n2011–12\n|\n2012–13\n|\n2013–14\n|\n2014–15\n|\n2015–16\n|\n|\nMinimum Guarantee\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nGeneral Fund\n|\n$36,465\n|\n$34,184\n|\n$36,733\n|\n$38,847\n|\n$41,058\n|\n$43,270\n|\n|\nLocal property tax\n|\n13,193\n|\n13,272\n|\n13,598\n|\n14,014\n|\n14,559\n|\n15,231\n|\n|\nTotals\n|\n$49,658a\n|\n$47,456\n|\n$50,331\n|\n$52,861\n|\n$55,617\n|\n$58,501\n|\n|\nPercent change\n|\n|\n–4.4%\n|\n6.1%\n|\n5.0%\n|\n5.2%\n|\n5.2%\n|\n|\nProposition 98 “Test”\n|\n2\n|\n1\n|\n2\n|\n2\n|\n2\n|\n1\n|\n|\nProposition 98 Obligations\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nMaintenance Factor Created/Paid (+/–)\n|\n$475\n|\n$3,929\n|\n–$1,229\n|\n–$463\n|\n–$392\n|\n–$611\n|\n|\nOutstanding Maintenance Factor\n|\n9,489\n|\n13,749\n|\n12,996\n|\n13,067\n|\n13,259\n|\n13,189\n|\n|\nKey Factors\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nK–12 average daily attendance\n|\n–0.12%\n|\n0.14%\n|\n0.20%\n|\n0.17%\n|\n0.33%\n|\n0.50%\n|\n|\nCCC full–time equivalent students\n|\n1.40\n|\n1.00\n|\n1.00\n|\n1.00\n|\n1.00\n|\n1.00\n|\n|\nPer capita personal income (Test 2)\n|\n0.62\n|\n3.33\n|\n3.26\n|\n3.93\n|\n4.13\n|\n3.57\n|\n|\nPer capita General Fund (Test 3)\n|\n5.92\n|\n–7.31\n|\n6.54\n|\n5.42\n|\n5.42\n|\n5.12\n|\n|\nK–14 COLA\n|\n–0.39\n|\n1.78\n|\n1.34\n|\n1.76\n|\n2.23\n|\n2.37\n|\n|\nYear–to–Year Change\n|\n|\n–$1,946\n|\n$2,875\n|\n$2,530\n|\n$2,756\n|\n$2,884\n|\n|\nLess Baseline Costs\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nK–14 COLA\n|\n|\n–$864\n|\n–$663\n|\n–$883\n|\n–$1,144\n|\n–$1,252\n|\n|\nK–14 attendance\n|\n|\n–101\n|\n–124\n|\n–116\n|\n–206\n|\n–305\n|\n|\nBackfill of one–time actions\n|\n|\n–2,272\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n—\n|\n|\nFunds Available/Shortfall (+/–)\n|\n|\n–$5,184\n|\n$2,088\n|\n$1,531\n|\n$1,406\n|\n$1,326\n|\nMaintenance Factor Obligation Grows in 2011–12, Remains Large Throughout Period. Figure 2 also shows both how much maintenance factor is created or paid in each year of the forecast period and the total amount of outstanding maintenance factor. As shown in the figure, we estimate the state will have an outstanding maintenance factor obligation of $9.5 billion at the end of 2010–11. Using the same maintenance factor assumptions as used to build the last three Proposition 98 budgets, $4 billion in new maintenance factor would be created in 2011–12—resulting in a total outstanding obligation of about $14 billion. During the remainder of the forecast period, the state would make relatively small maintenance factor payments each year. Because maintenance factor obligations grow (akin to an inflationary adjustment) and the required payments are small, we project the state would end the forecast period still having an outstanding maintenance factor obligation of more than $13 billion.\nBaseline Costs Much Higher Than Available Resources in 2011–12, Can Be Covered Thereafter. The bottom part of Figure 2 compares our projection of the year–to–year change in the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee with the amount needed to fund annual increases in baseline costs. As shown in the figure, the minimum guarantee would fall $5.2 billion short of fully funding baseline K–14 costs in 2011–12. (This shortfall would be a few hundred million dollars higher if the Legislature chooses to restore the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids [CalWORKs] Stage 3 child care program vetoed by the Governor this year.) That is, if the state funded at the minimum guarantee level in 2011–12, school districts and community college districts would face significant programmatic reductions. As shown in the figure, this is due to the decline in Proposition 98 funding in 2011–12 coupled with the cost of backfilling for the loss of one–time 2010–11 budget solutions. These reductions would occur at the same time as school districts exhaust one–time revenues from the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 and the Education Jobs and Medicaid Assistance Act of 2010. In every subsequent year of the forecast period, the minimum guarantee funding level would be sufficient to cover growth and COLA and still have $1 billion to $2 billion to restore prior budget reductions. By 2015–16, the minimum guarantee would grow to sufficient levels that all growth and COLA costs could be paid and any reductions made in 2011–12 could be restored. Funding would be insufficient, however, to restore reductions made in 2008–09, 2009–10, and 2010–11.\nSettle–Up Assumed to Be Paid in Installments Throughout Forecast Period. For 2009–10, the state provided $1.8 billion less than the minimum guarantee—creating a “settle–up” obligation of that amount. Additionally, for 2010–11, we assume a new $256 million settle–up obligation is created as a result of the Governor’s veto of Stage 3 child care funding (consistent with the administration’s intent). The 2010–11 budget contained a $300 million first payment toward retiring the 2009–10 settle–up obligation. Consistent with this action, we assume the state continues to make $300 million annual payments throughout the forecast period—fully retiring the settle–up obligations in the last year of the forecast.\nMajor Proposition 98 Issues\nWe believe the Legislature should be mindful of several major issues as it begins to develop a Proposition 98 budget strategy for the coming fiscal year.\nUnresolved Maintenance Factor Issues Quickly Reemerge. As we discussed in our Analysis of the 2010–11 Budget: Proposition 98 and K–12 Education, conflicting interpretations of the constitutional provisions of Proposition 98 led to uncertainty over the amount of maintenance factor owed at the close of 2008–09. Specifically, disagreement existed regarding whether a maintenance factor was created when Test 1 applied and was lower than Test 2. The 2009–10 Budget Act resolved the issue by declaring that a maintenance factor obligation was created in 2008–09. Current law, however, does not clarify how this situation should be addressed in future years. In our forecast, this particular scenario reemerges in 2011–12, with the state potentially creating a maintenance factor obligation of $4 billion in 2011–12. (As indicated above, our forecast assumes a maintenance factor is created.) Differences of opinion also exist with regards to how maintenance factor payments should be calculated (either on top of the Test 2 level or the Test 1 level, if higher). This particular scenario reemerges in 2012–13, with an impact of about $900 million. (Our forecast assumes the lower Proposition 98 estimate, consistent with the manner in which the minimum guarantee was calculated in the 2009–10 and 2010–11 budgets.)\nPotential Reductions on Horizon Suggest Rethinking Recent Deferrals. Given the potentially sizeable drop in the minimum guarantee next year (absent legislative action to add new revenues), one action the Legislature could take early in the upcoming budget cycle is eliminating the $1.8 billion in K–14 payments deferred until July 2011. (As part of the 2010–11 budget package, the state authorized 2010–11 spending using funds borrowed from 2011–12.) With the projected drop in the 2011–12 minimum guarantee, the recent payment deferrals would translate into K–14 cuts almost double the level otherwise needed in 2011–12. Given most districts have been cautious in increasing 2010–11 program support as a result of the recent deferrals and some districts have been unable to access cash sufficient to support new spending paid for by the new deferrals, many districts would not be significantly impacted in 2010–11 if the new deferral payments were eliminated. In essence, rather than encouraging school districts to hire new staff for half of the 2010–11 school year merely to have the new staff and even more existing staff laid off next year, the state would be encouraging school districts to retain their existing staff levels and plan for fewer layoffs next year. Such action would help minimize the funding cliff that could result next year.\nRelying on More Deferrals Increasingly Problematic. Including the recent deferrals, 17 percent of K–14 program support is paid using funds borrowed from the next fiscal year. In monetary terms, the first $8.2 billion in Proposition 98 funds the state provides each year is paying for K–14 services that local educational agencies already have provided. Though districts are assumed to front the cash to support programs until the state makes payment, some local educational agencies (particularly small districts, districts with negative budget certifications, and charter schools) have had notable difficulty and/or have not been able to front the cash. As a result, for these agencies deferrals increasingly are translating into de facto cuts. For most districts, big and small, cash management has become an increasingly significant issue, with Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Teams reporting that the bulk of its district support is now devoted to cash flow management. These issues also are affecting the number of districts with negative or at–risk budget certifications, with 123 school districts in 2007–08 identified as having these certifications compared with 174 districts in 2009–10. Negative certifications in particular can make district borrowing significantly, if not prohibitively, more expensive. For all these reasons, the Legislature may want to avoid adopting new inter–year deferrals as part of its 2011–12 budget strategy as well as monitor district health to determine if more districts could need an emergency state loan in 2011–12.\nHelp Districts by Maximizing Flexibility and Sending Signals Early. Though the state might not be able to provide monetary relief to distressed districts, the Legislature can help school districts and CCC districts in various ways. Among the most notable ways are by retaining existing flexibility provisions, extending some of those provisions, and exploring new types of flexibility. Over the last couple of years, districts have reported relying heavily on these flexibility provisions to meet critical local needs and balance their budgets. In general, these flexibility measure expire at the end of 2012–13; yet, under state law, districts currently need to project costs through 2013–14 for budgeting purposes. Thus, another way the Legislature could help districts is by beginning to think about what flexibility rules it wants in place come 2013–14. The Legislature might want to consider fundamental school finance reform that could take a couple years to develop. Starting these conversations now will better position both the state and districts for whatever transition might happen in 2013–14.\nHigher Education\nIn addition to the community colleges (which are discussed above as part of the Proposition 98 forecast), the state’s public higher education entities include the University of California (UC), the California State University (CSU), the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC), and the California Postsecondary Education Commission.\nUC and CSU Expenditures\nOur forecast assumes the universities’ annual operating costs will be roughly even at about $5.5 billion over the course of the forecast period. This reflects our overall forecast approach of not providing automatic COLAs. This amount is somewhat higher than state spending in 2010–11, which takes advantage of one–time federal stimulus funds that offset state costs. We discuss the stimulus funds in more detail below.\n“Tidal Wave II” Is Over. Beginning in the 1990s, sustained growth in the traditional college–age population created ongoing enrollment pressures in higher education. This demographic bulge has been popularly known as Tidal Wave II (following a larger demographic surge in the 1960s). While there was some disagreement over the magnitude of Tidal Wave II, by all accounts the demographic growth has plateaued and the college–age population will actually be declining in the latter years of the forecast. Already the annual number of high school graduates has begun to shrink.\nEnrollment demand at the universities results not just from the size of their eligibility pools, but also on the percentage of eligible individuals who seek admission. We are unable to project changes in this latter factor. We assume, however, that the shrinking eligibility pool would generally cancel out the effect of a modest increase in the demand rate. For this reason, we assume no increase in university enrollment during the forecast period.\nFees Projected to Continue Rising. A significant portion of core operating costs at the universities is covered by student fees. The state has no expressed policy for annual adjustments to these fees, which are set by the universities’ governing boards. In recent years, the universities have generally raised fees at double–digit rates in order to compensate for limited state funding. This pattern, as well as statements by the universities, suggests that student fees will continue to increase for the next few years. Any fee increases could be used to cover new costs—such as inflation and expansion of institution–based financial aid programs—that are not accounted for in our General Fund forecast. Expanded federal, state, and institutional student aid programs will offset a significant proportion of fee increases, particularly for lower–income students.\nFederal Funds Provided One–Time Budget Solution. The Governor’s 2010–11 budget proposal included $305 million in General Fund augmentations to restore prior–year cuts of the same amount at UC and CSU. The Legislature instead approved General Fund augmentations of $199 million, and appropriated $106.6 million for each university system in one–time federal stimulus funding. Our forecast assumes that this federal funding is replaced with base General Fund support starting in 2011–12.\nUC Restarting Contributions to Retirement Program. For close to two decades, neither the state nor UC employees have made contributions to the UC Retirement Program (UCRP). This is because, until recently, UCRP investments were sufficient to cover the retirement cost obligations for UC employees. This is no longer the case, and UC has re–instituted employee payroll contributions toward the UCRP. Meanwhile, as part of the 2009–10 budget package, the Legislature adopted statutory language declaring its intent that no new General Fund augmentations would be made toward UCRP costs. In the 2010–11 budget package, the Legislature deleted that language. A new budget provision directing UC to provide a long–term plan for renewed funding of UCRP, including a proposal for state contributions, was vetoed by the Governor.\nBecause there is no statutory formula or adopted plan governing state support for UCRP, we did not include General Fund costs for UCRP during the forecast period. Based on discussions with UC, however, we estimate that their proposal could call for state General Fund contributions exceeding $400 million annually by the end of the forecast period.\nKey Choices Facing Legislature. Given that state General Fund resources are likely to continue to be severely constrained for the next several years, the Legislature faces key questions with regard to the higher education budget.\n- How Much Should Students Pay? As noted above, the universities are likely to be increasing student fees at double–digit annual rates for at least the next several years. Not only does this affect the cost of education for students, it also increases state costs for the Cal Grant financial aid programs. The Legislature may wish to provide direction to the universities with regard to the share of education cost that non–needy students should be expected to pay.\n- How Should the Universities Reduce Operating Costs? In a reversal of earlier budget reductions, the universities in 2010–11 are receiving more total funding per student than they were before the current recession began. Given the likelihood of continuing state budget constraints for the next several years, it may be necessary for the universities to reduce their per–student costs. The Legislature may wish to express expectations with regard to cost–saving opportunities related to student–faculty ratios, student remediation rates, articulation of course sequences, student assessment and placement, caps on the number of course units a student may take at subsidized rates, use of summer session, expansion of distance education and other alternative modes of instruction, and other considerations.\n- How Should the State Address UCRP Costs? As discussed above, UC’s current plans to restart UCRP contributions envision a corresponding increase in UC’s General Fund support, reaching several hundred million dollars per year by the end of the forecast period. This constitutes one of the largest single General Fund augmentation requests the Legislature is likely to be considering in the near future. Until UC finalizes a detailed plan, we are unable to advise the Legislature on UC’s estimated state contribution. Besides the magnitude of any augmentation, the Legislature will also have to consider how state support would be adjusted in future years, including potential increases or decreases in UCRP normal costs and unfunded liabilities. For example, annual state contributions to UCRP could be tied to other public retirement systems (such as the California Public Employees Retirement System [CalPERS]). Alternatively, the state’s contribution to UCRP could take the form of a base increase to UC’s operating budget. The UC would then be expected to manage its retirement costs out of its regular General Fund appropriations as it does for most other ongoing support costs.\nCSAC\nCal Grant Programs. Most of the state’s direct General Fund support for student financial aid is directed through the Cal Grant programs, which provide fee coverage and subsistence grants to eligible students. These costs increase with expanded program participation and fee increases. Based on these factors, we project that Cal Grant costs will increase from $1.1 billion in 2010–11 to $1.6 billion at the end of the forecast period.\nHealth\nCalifornia’s major health programs provide health coverage and additional services for various groups of eligible persons—primarily poor families and children as well as seniors and persons with disabilities. The federal Medicaid program, known as Medi–Cal in California, is the largest state health program both in terms of funding and number of persons served. In addition, the state supports various public health programs, community services and state–operated facilities for the mentally ill and developmentally disabled, and health care insurance for children through the Healthy Families Program (HFP).\nPhase–Out of Enhanced Federal Match. One factor that increases state costs for some health programs over the forecast period is the phase–out of the enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) originally provided under ARRA and extended through June of 2011 by further congressional actions. Historically, the state and federal government share most Medi–Cal costs on a roughly equal basis. However, ARRA temporarily increased the federal share for California to almost 62 percent beginning in October 2008 and continuing through December 2010. Between January and June of 2011, the enhanced federal match will be phased out and the state’s share of most Medi–Cal costs will return to a roughly equal basis in July 2011. When the enhanced FMAP ends, it will reduce federal funding for programs in the departments of Health Care Services, Developmental Services, and Mental Health, among others. Our forecast assumes that the reductions in federal funding will be backfilled with General Fund spending. Notably, this has the effect of increasing the year–over–year percentage growth in General Fund spending for these programs in 2011–12 compared to 2010–11.\nImpact of Federal Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA, also referred to as federal health care reform, is far–reaching legislation that will change how millions of Californians access health care coverage. Among many other provisions, the new federal law expands federal funding and eligibility for the Medi–Cal Program and mandates that individuals obtain private or public health coverage. Some key provisions will not take effect until 2014. The scope of ACA is so broad that it will be years before all of its provisions will be fully implemented and its overall ramifications fully understood. Over the next few years, the federal government will promulgate regulations that will clarify ACA and give more detailed guidance on how many of its provisions are to be implemented. Our fiscal forecast includes some significant budgetary adjustments to account for the implementation of ACA. However, our estimates of these adjustments are preliminary in nature and may change significantly in the future as more details emerge regarding ACA implementation.\nWaiver Renewal Approved by Federal Authorities. The Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) submitted a Medi–Cal waiver request to the federal centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). At the time this forecast was prepared, the waiver application had just been approved by CMS. As a result of an expected increase in federal funds of up to $500 million annually through 2014–15, we have reduced overall General Fund spending by comparable amounts. (These savings, which will accrue to various state departments, have not been allocated to specific health programs.)\nMedi–Cal\nOverall Spending Trends. We estimate that the General Fund spending for Medi–Cal local assistance administered by DHCS in the current year will amount to almost $12.6 billion. This is about $396 million, or 3.2 percent, more than appropriated in the 2010–11 Budget Act. We project that General Fund support will grow to $17.6 billion in 2011–12, a 40 percent increase from current–year expenditures. The biggest factors contributing to this year–over–year spending growth are: (1) changes in the FMAP discussed above that result in the need for the state to backfill lost federal funds with General Fund; (2) increases in caseload, utilization of services, and rising costs for those services; (3) erosion of budget savings; and (4) expiration of one–time solutions assumed in the 2010–11 budget plan. We project that spending will reach about $24 billion by the end of the forecast period in 2015–16.\nKey Program Cost–Drivers. A significant forecast factor is our assumption that the cost per person of Medi–Cal health services will grow at an average annual rate of about 5.5 percent. We also project that the overall Medi–Cal caseload will grow nearly 4 percent annually commensurate with increases in the state population, policy changes, and other underlying trends. Due to the recent passage of ACA, as described above, Medi–Cal caseload will increase significantly beginning in January 2014. The federal government will cover the costs for those individuals who are considered newly eligible under ACA during the forecast period. The state will share costs for any increase in caseload in existing eligibility categories that results from persons enrolling in Medi–Cal in response to the individual coverage mandate created under ACA. We note that, due to ACA, our estimates related to caseload growth and other economic factors contain a significantly greater degree of uncertainty than in the last few years.\nErosion of Assumed Budget Savings. Due to implementation delays resulting from the passage of a late budget, we estimate that certain budget solutions will achieve less in savings than assumed in the 2010–11 spending plan. We also assume that none of an unspecified $323 million budget reduction in Medi–Cal will be achieved.\nExpiration of One–Time Savings Measures. We estimate that Medi–Cal spending will increase significantly in 2011–12 due to the expiration of several one–time savings measures included in the 2010–11 budget plan. These savings include: (1) about $3 billion from the receipt of additional federal funds; (2) $560 million in hospital provider fee funds allocated for children’s health coverage; and (3) about $380 million in payment deferrals for institutional providers, managed care plans, and provider repayments to the federal government. The forecast assumes that these one–time savings measures will be backfilled with General Fund spending in 2011–12.\nHealthy Families\nWe estimate that $123 million from the General Fund will be spent for support of HFP in 2010–11. An expected one–time contribution of $81 million from the California Children and Families Commission, $193 million from a temporary tax on Medi–Cal managed care plans, and reimbursements from other sources, is projected to bring total state support for the program in 2010–11 to $405 million. Due to the expiration of these one–time funding sources that offset General Fund support, we estimate that General Fund spending for HFP will grow to $425 million in 2011–12 and continue growing until 2014–15, but decline significantly in 2015–16 due to the impact of ACA.\nRecent Caseload Trends Are Flat, but Growth Is Projected to Resume. Ever since enrollment dipped due to a temporary program closure in fall 2009, caseload in the HFP has remained relatively flat. We project that caseload will begin climbing again in 2011, and will continue to grow throughout the forecast period consistent with past annual caseload growth rates of approximately 5 percent.\nOther Cost–Drivers. Our forecast assumes increased costs for provision of health care due to general growth in medical costs. In addition, the forecast includes local assistance cost increases associated with program changes required by the U.S. Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA). The state may also incur further costs throughout the forecast period due to additional CHIPRA requirements for substance abuse, mental health, and dental benefits. These costs are not included in the forecast, due to uncertainty at this time regarding the cost implications of complying with these requirements.\nACA Provision Will Lower General Fund Costs in Out–Years. The ACA specifies that the federal matching rate for HFP will increase from 65 percent to 88 percent beginning October 1, 2015. If not for this enhanced match, we would project HFP General Fund costs of $570 million for 2015–16, the last year of our forecast period. Instead, we project that the enhanced federal match in 2015–16 will reduce HFP General Fund costs to $289 million.\nDevelopmental Services\nWe estimate that the General Fund spending for developmental services in 2010–11 will total $2.5 billion. We project that General Fund support will grow to more than $3.1 billion in 2011–12, a 23 percent increase from current–year expenditures. This year–over–year projected growth is largely due to the phase out of the enhanced FMAP rate provided under ARRA and the expiration of temporary provider payment reductions that were implemented as a cost–cutting measure.\nWe project that General Fund support will grow to almost $3.9 billion by the end of the forecast period in 2015–16. This projected growth is largely due to increased caseload, utilization of services, and rising costs for community services provided in regional centers. Our forecast assumes that regional center caseloads will grow at an annual average rate of 3.6 percent, and that costs overall will grow at an average annual rate of about 7 percent.\nSocial Services\nCalifornia’s major social services programs provide a variety of benefits to its citizens. These include income maintenance for the aged, blind, or disabled; cash assistance and welfare–to–work services for low–income families with children; protecting children from abuse and neglect; providing home–care workers who assist the aged and disabled in remaining in their own homes; and subsidized child care for families with incomes under 75 percent of the state median. Although state departments oversee the management of these programs, the actual delivery of many services at the local level is carried out by county welfare and child support departments. Most social services programs are supported by a mix of state, federal, and county funds. (In the nearby box, we also discuss the rising General Fund costs of the federal–state unemployment insurance program.)\nGeneral Fund Impact of the Unemployment Insurance Insolvency\nThe Unemployment Insurance (UI) program is a federal–state program that provides weekly UI payments to eligible workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. The UI program is financed by unemployment tax contributions paid by employers for each covered worker.\nInsolvency. As we discussed in our recent report, California’s Other Budget Deficit: The Unemployment Insurance Fund Insolvency, the UI fund is currently insolvent and ended 2009 with a deficit of $6.2 billion. Based on earlier Employment Development Department (EDD) estimates, this report indicated that the deficit could reach $20 billion by the end of 2011. In its most recent fund forecast, EDD estimates that the fund will have a deficit of $10 billion at the end of 2010, rising to $13.4 billion in 2011 and $16 billion by the end of 2012.\nFederal Loans. Because of the insolvency, EDD obtains federal loans on a quarterly basis to cover projected fund deficits. To date, the state has borrowed about $8.7 billion, permitting California to make benefit payments to UI claimants without interruption. Federal loans lasting more than one year generally will accumulate interest charges of about 5 percent per year on the outstanding balance.\nTemporary Federal Relief. The federal economic stimulus package enacted in 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, relieves states from making interest payments for UI loans through December 31, 2010. After December 2010, the state must resume making interest payments. The EDD estimates that the interest amount due in September 2011, for nine months of interest accruing from January 2011 through September 2011, will be about $360 million.\nAddressing the Insolvency. To restore solvency, the state must increase employer taxes, reduce benefits, or do some combination of the two. Our report on the insolvency discusses the advantages and disadvantages of potential solutions to this difficult problem.\nBudget Forecast. Absent corrective action, the UI fund will remain insolvent for the foreseeable future, and interest costs will continue to grow significantly. We estimate that these costs will reach about $700 million by the final year of our forecast, 2015–16. Under federal law, these interest charges cannot be paid from the UI fund. Our forecast assumes that these interest payments become a General Fund cost beginning in 2011–12.\n|\nMajor Current–Year Adjustments. The 2010–11 budget provided $8.7 billion from the General Fund to support social services programs and departments. We now estimate that General Fund costs for social services will be $9.3 billion. Most of this increase is attributable to backfilling for assumed federal funds which have not been approved by Congress and anticipated delays in realizing savings from certain recently adopted budget solutions.\nOverall Spending Trends in Social Services. Based on current law requirements, we project that General Fund spending will increase from a revised $9.3 billion in 2010–11 to approximately $10.7 billion in 2011–12 and $11 billion in 2012–13. For the final year three years of the forecast, we project that spending will remain relatively flat, reaching $11.1 billion in 2015–16. The $1.4 billion increase in 2011–12 is mostly attributable to the General Fund cost of backfilling temporary federal funds from the ARRA (discussed earlier in the “Health” section) and the expiration of certain short–term solutions adopted in the past two budget cycles. The relatively slow growth in the out–years of the forecast is because caseload growth in IHSS and Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Program (SSI/SSP) is offset by caseload declines in CalWORKs and Foster Care.\nCosts of Providing COLAs. Current law suspends COLAs for social services programs. If the Legislature elected annually to provide the discretionary California Necessities Index COLAs for social services benefits, however, total General Fund costs in 2015–16 would be about $550 million higher than we have projected. This approach would result in additional costs of approximately $350 million in CalWORKs, $160 million in SSI/SSP, and $40 million in Foster Care. Similarly, if the Legislature elected to provide the counties, which administer most of these programs, with annual inflationary adjustments, total annual General Fund costs in 2015–16 would increase by about $410 million.\nCalWORKs\nOverall Spending Trends. For 2010–11, the state budget provided $1.7 billion from the General Fund for CalWORKs. The budget assumed that Congress would reauthorize the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Emergency Contingency Fund (ECF) and provide California with about $400 million to offset General Fund costs. However, the TANF ECF expired on September 30, 2010. Because Congress has not yet acted to continue the program, our forecast assumes a General Fund backfill of about $400 million. From a revised base of $2.1 billion in 2010–11, we project that spending will increase by about $900 million in 2011–12, peak at about of $3.1 billion in 2012–13, and then decline to about $2.7 billion by the end of the forecast period.\nOur projection of a $1 billion increase in spending over the next two years is largely attributable to: (1) a General Fund backfill to replace a one–time savings from the accelerated receipt of TANF block grant funds in 2010–11, (2) caseload growth, (3) the fixed federal TANF block grant, which does not adjust for caseload increases, and (4) backfilling of TANF ECF funds. We explain these changes in more detail below. Last year, the Legislature made additional substantial short– and long–term policy changes in the CalWORKs program, as discussed below. Their fiscal effects are also reflected in the forecast.\nReplacing One–Time Savings From Accelerated Receipt of Federal Funds. The 2010–11 budget assumes that California will take advantage of existing federal rules which allow states to draw down an extra 10 percent of their TANF block grant during the final quarter of the state fiscal year. On a one–time basis, this will result in increased federal funding of $366 million and corresponding General Fund savings. In 2011–12, the forecast provides a General Fund backfill of $366 million to replace the federal funding.\nCaseload Costs Affected Mainly by Economic Conditions. The forecast reflects some significant assumptions about how the CalWORKs caseload and the state’s economy will change during the next five years. During 2008–09 and 2009–10, the caseload increased by about 8 percent and 10 percent, respectively, as the state suffered a severe recession. The rate of caseload growth appears to have peaked toward the end of calendar 2009 and the latest data through July 2010 indicate that the caseload has only grown by 2.3 percent over the last seven months. The latest data are consistent with the budget forecast of 4.7 percent caseload growth during 2010–11. We are forecasting growth of 4.5 percent in 2011–12 and 2.6 percent in 2012–13. After that, we expect the caseload to flatten, with a gradual decline in 2014–15 as the economy improves.\nState, Rather Than Federal Government, Bears Caseload Costs. Although General Fund support for CalWORKs is only $2.1 billion in 2010–11, total program costs, including federal funds, are approximately $6 billion. Each 1 percent increase in caseload results in state costs of about $60 million per year, because the TANF block grant is fixed.\nAdditional Backfill for TANF ECF. Because federal support for CalWORKs from the TANF ECF ended in September 2010, the forecast assumes a backfill of about $400 million from the General Fund in 2010–11, with an additional $115 million in 2011–12.\nCost of Restoring Funds for Short–Term Policy Changes. For 2009–10 and 2010–11, the Legislature (1) exempted families with very young children or families with two or more preschool children from work participation requirements and (2) reduced associated county block grants for employment services and child care by $375 million. Our forecast reflects complete restoration of these reductions in 2011–12.\nSavings From Long–Term Changes. Commencing in 2011–12, the Legislature created a system of (1) shortened time limits for most families on aid, (2) increased sanctions, and (3) new county service obligations for families affected by these new policies. The net impact of these changes is very hard to estimate, but our forecast assumes net savings of about $200 million beginning in 2011–12 and growing to $250 million in 2012–13.\nSSI/SSP\nState expenditures for SSI/SSP are estimated to be about $3 billion in 2010–11 and 2011–12. We project that General Fund support for SSI/SSP will increase by about $85 million each year, reaching about $3.4 billion by 2015–16.\nCosts Primarily Driven by Caseload Growth. The spending increases that we project in SSI/SSP are primarily due to expected caseload growth of about 2.3 percent annually. In our forecast, the primary driver of the caseload increase is the anticipated growth in the aging population. As discussed earlier, the Legislature eliminated automatic COLAs for many programs, including SSI/SSP. Thus, COLA costs are not included in this forecast, contributing to the relatively slow spending growth in SSI/SSP.\nIHSS\nFor 2010–11, we estimate that General Fund spending for IHSS will be about $1.4 billion, which is roughly $200 million above the budget appropriation. For 2011–12, we estimate General Fund costs will reach about $1.7 billion. We project that General Fund support for IHSS will increase to just over $2 billion in 2015–16. Most of the growth in spending occurs within the first two years of the forecast period, followed by more modest growth in the out–years. The $600 million in spending growth over the forecast period is primarily due to (1) the General Fund backfill of lost additional federal funds, (2) caseload growth, and (3) the expiration of a temporary budget reduction. Below, we first discuss the changes in 2010–11, and then turn to a discussion of the major IHSS program cost drivers in the out–years.\nNew Budget Solutions and Estimated Erosion in 2010–11. As noted above, our forecast assumes that IHSS program costs will be $200 million more than appropriated in 2010–11. As part of the 2010–11 budget plan for IHSS, the Legislature adopted (1) a provider tax and supplemental payment which will draw down additional federal funds, (2) a 3.6 percent reduction to authorized service hours, and (3) a caseload savings relative to prior estimates. Together, this package of solutions was estimated to save $300 million in 2010–11. For 2010–11, our review suggests that this package will only save about $155 million and that a portion of the savings ($45 million) from previously enacted anti–fraud activities will not be achieved. We discuss these adjustments below.\n- Delayed Implementation. For both the provider tax and the 3.6 percent reduction in service hours, our forecast assumes later implementation than was assumed in the 2010–11 budget plan. This delay is likely because of the time required for recipient notification and automation system changes.\n- Increased Utilization of Authorized Hours. In addition to our assumption related to delayed implementation, our forecast assumes further erosion of the savings associated with the 3.6 percent reduction in authorized service hours. Because not all recipients currently utilize all of their authorized hours, the approved reduction in authorized hours will not save 3.6 percent of program costs for all recipients.\n- Interaction of Savings Estimates for Caseload and Anti–Fraud Activities. Due to technical interactions related to the assumed savings from anti–fraud activities and caseload savings, our forecast assumes less combined savings from these two factors than was included in the 2010–11 budget.\nBackfill for Loss of Federal Funds in 2011–12. Because federal relief initially provided pursuant to the ARRA (discussed above in the “Health” section) ends in June 2011, the forecast provides a General Fund backfill of $298 million in 2011–12.\nIHSS Caseload Growth. Our forecast assumes the IHSS caseload will grow at 3.3 percent per year throughout the forecast period, which is lower than in past years. This is based on recent data which reflect a slowing in the growth of the caseload. This lower caseload growth could be attributed to a combination of factors related to recent program changes.\nTwo–Year 3.6 Percent Service Hour Reduction and Current Law Suspension. As noted above, 2010–11 budget legislation temporarily reduced authorized hours for IHSS recipients by 3.6 percent through June 2012. As explained in our January 2010 report, How the Special Session Actions Would Affect Social Services, a federal judge has issued injunctions preventing implementation of service hours and wage reductions enacted in 2009–10. During the time the new 3.6 percent reduction is in place, budget legislation suspends the 2009–10 reductions to allow for current court challenges to be resolved. Given the uncertainty of the current litigation, our forecast assumes no savings from these 2009–10 reductions.\nJudiciary and Criminal Justice\nThe major state judiciary and criminal justice programs include support for two departments in the executive branch—the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) and the Department of Justice—as well as expenditures for the state court system.\nCDCR\nOur forecast assumes that General Fund spending for the support of CDCR operations will increase from $9.3 billion in 2010–11 to $9.8 billion in 2015–16. This projection reflects additional costs to staff and operate new prison facilities that are expected to be constructed during the forecast period. As discussed below, we estimate that state spending on corrections will be almost $1 billion higher than the budgeted amount for 2010–11, primarily due to planned savings that largely will not be realized.\nPolicy Changes Needed to Fully Achieve Budget Savings. The 2010–11 budget assumed $820 million in savings in the federal Receiver’s inmate medical services program by releasing certain infirm inmates early from prison and placing them on parole based on their medical status and from other unspecified operational and policy changes. However, our forecast assumes that most of these savings will not be realized in the current year. This is primarily due to the absence of a complete plan as to how the Receiver will achieve all of the assumed savings. Moreover, our forecast also assumes that a separate $219 million population–related reduction in the 2010–11 budget will not be fully achieved as planned, due to the fact that sufficient statutory changes to allow for a significant reduction in correctional populations were not adopted as part of the budget.\nOngoing Operating Costs Projected to Increase. Chapter 7, Statutes of 2007 (AB 900, Solorio), authorizes the construction of tens of thousands of additional prison beds. Our projections assume that about 16,300 additional beds will be constructed pursuant to AB 900 during the forecast period, resulting in an estimated $800 million in additional General Fund expenditures to staff and operate the new facilities. As the new facilities are built, the Legislature will need to make policy and budgetary decisions regarding the level of programming and staffing to be provided at these facilities, which will determine the actual increase in operational costs. Given the likely magnitude of these eventual costs, as well as a federal court order to significantly reduce the state’s inmate population (see nearby box for more detailed information), the Legislature may wish to reconsider the need for some of the projects authorized under AB 900.\nFederal Court Order to Reduce Inmate Population Not Reflected in Projections\nOn January 12, 2010, a federal three–judge panel issued a ruling requiring the state to reduce the inmate population in its prisons to 137.5 percent of design capacity—a reduction of roughly 40,000 inmates—within two years. However, the court stayed implementation of this court ruling pending the state’s appeal of the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The January 12 ruling does not specify the particular inmate population reduction measures that the state must implement. However, the court did require the administration to submit an inmate population reduction plan on November 19, 2009, and indicated in its January 12 ruling that the administration could implement the measures identified in the plan. This plan included certain changes that were adopted as part of the 2009–10 budget (such as increasing the credits that inmates can earn to reduce their stay in prison), as well as certain changes that the Governor proposed for 2010–11 but were rejected by the Legislature (such as requiring that certain felons be incarcerated in county jail in lieu of state prison).\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the state’s appeal on November 30, 2010. Given that the ruling is still under appeal, our forecast does not reflect the savings that could result from such a massive population reduction. However, if the court were to uphold the three–judge panel’s ruling and the state inmate population were to be reduced 137.5 percent of design capacity, we estimate that state spending could decline beginning in 2011–12 in the range of about several hundreds of millions of dollars annually relative to our baseline forecast for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\n|\nProviding Inflationary Adjustments Would Further Increase Spending. As discussed earlier in this report, our forecast assumes no price adjustments for CDCR’s operating expenses and equipment. If the Legislature were to provide such adjustments each year, we estimate that the department’s expenditures would increase by about $350 million annually by the end of the forecast period, relative to our baseline projections. (This estimate does not include adjustments for employee compensation increases, which are discussed later in this chapter.)\nJudicial Branch\nGeneral Fund spending for the support of the judicial branch is projected to remain relatively flat at roughly $2 billion from 2011–12 through 2015–16. This amount is, however, higher than the amount the state will spend in 2010–11. As part of the 2010–11 budget package, a one–time shift of redevelopment funding will offset $350 million in General Fund costs for the trial courts in the current year. Our forecast assumes that the General Fund will replace the $350 million in 2011–12 and future years.\nProviding Inflationary Adjustments Would Further Increase Spending. As discussed earlier in this report, our forecast assumes no inflationary adjustments to the operating budget of trial courts. If the Legislature were to provide such adjustments, we estimate that operating expenditures for trial courts would increase by roughly $540 million annually by the end of the forecast period, relative to our baseline projections.\nOther Programs\nEmployee Compensation\nThe 2010–11 Budget Act assumes $1.4 billion in General Fund savings from various actions affecting state employee pay and benefit costs, including: a 12–month personal leave program (PLP) and increased employee pension contribution rates for most executive branch employees; a three day per month furlough program for employees in the six bargaining units with expired contracts; and an executive order directing departments to reduce workforce costs by 5 percent.\nShort–Term Net Personnel Savings. Our forecast assumes $1 billion in net employee compensation savings in 2010–11. We expect that difficulties associated with the implementation of the workforce cost reduction and other factors will result in over $300 million of the projected budget act savings not being realized.\nNo Net Savings in Out–Years. In our forecast, we estimate state costs to pay (1) salary increases beginning 2012 or 2013 for employees at their top step (pursuant to memoranda of understanding for the 15 bargaining units with ratified contracts) and (2) employee healthcare premiums (forecast to increase by 7.7 percent annually). By the end of the forecast period, these costs will more than offset the state’s ongoing savings from the increased employee pension contribution rates and workforce cap. In addition, we estimate that state savings from the unpaid leave programs will end by mid–2011–12 because the PLP expires after 12 months, and the administration currently does not have authority to extend furloughs beyond 2010–11. Consistent with current labor agreements and law, our forecast assumes no other salary increase through 2015–16, other than the ones described above.\nUncertainties. Many factors make it difficult to project future state employee compensation costs. New labor agreements with employee bargaining units could affect state savings under the unpaid leave programs. Similarly, actions by the Governor and/or Legislature to extend the leave programs or make other changes to employee compensation (beyond the top step pay increases included in the current bargaining agreements) could increase or decrease annual General Fund costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars each year.\nPublic Employee Retirement Costs\nOur forecast reflects current–law increases in the state’s annual payments to four major public employee retirement programs: pension programs for state and CSU employees, the teachers’ pension program, state and CSU retiree health benefit programs, and pension programs for judges. (The teachers’ pension program is administered by the California State Teachers’ Retirement System [CalSTRS], and the other three programs are administered by CalPERS.) The state’s required contributions to CalPERS for state and CSU pensions are forecasted to be about $3.6 billion (all funds) in 2010–11, growing to $3.9 billion in 2015–16. (This figure reflects estimated savings due to recent collective bargaining agreements that increase some employees’ pension contributions.) The General Fund pays just under 60 percent of these costs. The state’s required payments to CalSTRS—paid entirely from the General Fund—are estimated to be $1.3 billion in 2010–11 and grow to over $1.5 billion in 2015–16. The state’s “pay–as–you–go” retiree health benefit contributions to CalPERS are forecast to grow from $1.4 billion in 2010–11 to over $2 billion in 2015–16.\nState Payroll, Investment Return Assumptions, and Stock Values Drive CalPERS Costs. Our forecast includes fairly modest growth projections for the state’s CalPERS contributions. This is in contrast to consistent warnings from the system in recent years that state contribution rates are on track to increase significantly over time—due to the need to cover added liabilities resulting from the system’s 2008–09 investment declines and recent demographic experience of the system. There are several reasons for our projections:\n- Our assumption that state employees receive no salary increases except for the one step increase included in many of the labor agreements recently passed by the Legislature. (The CalPERS actuarial assumptions, by contrast, assume steady, regular, annual pay growth.)\n- Our assumption that investment returns will hit CalPERS’ current actuarial investment rate target—7.75 percent per year—each and every year and that other current actuarial assumptions will be met.\n- Our assumption that the current actuarial investment rate target will not change, despite indications from system officials that it might as soon as next year.\nEach of these key assumptions serves to contain growth of the state’s CalPERS contributions. If one or more of them were changed, the state’s contributions could be hundreds of millions of dollars higher than indicated in our forecast by 2015–16.\nAdditional Contributions to CalSTRS Assumed. Typically, the state pays about 4.5 percent of prior–year teacher payroll to CalSTRS. The CalSTRS also receives payments from school districts and teachers to cover its pension program costs. Under state law, the General Fund must contribute additional funds each year when certain unfunded liabilities emerge. Our forecast assumes that the system’s 2010 actuarial valuation—to be completed in 2011—will show that such unfunded liabilities emerge as the system recognizes more of its investment losses from 2008–09. In our forecast, these added contributions total $106 million in 2011–12 and grow to $392 million by 2012–13. (These added contributions are very small compared to the amount of funding the system would require to eliminate its unfunded liabilities over the next three decades.) In addition, our forecast assumes that in 2012–13 the state will finish paying off its court–ordered payments to compensate CalSTRS for the state’s decision to withhold a $500 million required contribution in 2003–04. Currently, the state pays $57 million per year related to the court order.\nUnfunded Liabilities Will Persist. The state’s retirement programs are projected to have significant—and growing—unfunded liabilities through the forecast period. Because our forecast includes only current–law pension contribution requirements, it does not include funding sufficient to begin to reduce CalSTRS’ unfunded liabilities, and it includes no resources to assist UC in restoring its pension program to a sound funding position. It also includes no funding to begin to pay down large unfunded liabilities for state, UC, and CSU retiree health costs. If the state does not initiate benefit decreases and/or contribution increases very soon, the extra costs needed to retire these huge unfunded liabilities over the next few decades will spiral upward.\nState–Mandated Local Programs (Non–Education)\nOver the last several years, the Legislature has taken various actions to reduce or defer costs for state mandates on local governments (cities, counties, and special districts). These actions include permanently repealing mandates, suspending statutory requirements to implement mandates, and deferring payments towards retiring the state’s backlog of mandate claims (over $1 billion). In signing the 2010–11 budget, the Governor eliminated funding for two mandates (AB 3632 and Background Checks) and asserted that local government responsibility for implementing these mandates was suspended for 2010–11.\nMandate Costs Escalate Sharply. Our forecast assumes that the Legislature continues to suspend all mandates that it suspended in 2011–12. Because state law does not appear to authorize the Governor to suspend mandates, we assume that local governments continue to implement the AB 3632 and Background Checks mandates during 2010–11 (and throughout the forecast period) and that the state reimburses local governments for these mandated costs. Our forecast also assumes that the state makes annual payments to retire the backlog of mandate claims, as specified in current law. Under these assumptions, state costs for mandates would increase from $80 million in 2010–11 to over $500 million annually throughout the forecast period.\nDebt Service on Infrastructure Bonds\nThe state uses General Fund revenues to pay debt–service costs for principal and interest payments on two types of bonds primarily used to fund infrastructure—voter–approved general obligation bonds and lease–revenue bonds approved by the Legislature. We estimate that General Fund costs for debt service on these bonds will be $6 billion in 2010–11 and $7.2 billion in 2011–12. General Fund debt service is projected to grow at 8.4 percent annually between 2010–11 and 2015–16. Annual General Fund costs are about $1 billion higher each year due to the recent passage of Proposition 22 and 26 which restricted the use of transportation funds to pay bond costs. The relatively high pace of debt–service growth is due in part to the increase in bond sales from the large general obligation bond authorizations in 2006 and 2008, as well as the growing issuance of AB 900 lease–revenue bonds for the prison system. Our forecast is based on the planned sale of bonds that already have been authorized, but does not include any proposed bonds—such as the water bonds now scheduled for the 2012 ballot. Our forecast also assumes a minor reduction in debt–service costs—approximately 1 percent of total General Fund debt–service costs over the forecast period—due to the planned sale–leaseback of 11 state office properties. Because the sale proceeds will be used to retire the outstanding debt on those buildings, the scheduled debt–service payments are eliminated. (This reduction in General Fund debt–service costs, however, is more than offset by the cost of leasing those facilities back from the new owners.)\nDebt–Service Ratio (DSR) Expected to Rise. The DSR for general obligation and lease–revenue bonds—that is, the ratio of annual General Fund debt–service costs to annual General Fund revenues and transfers—is often used as one indicator of the state’s debt burden. There is no one “right” level for the DSR. The higher it is and more rapidly it rises, however, the more closely bond raters, financial analysts, and investors tend to look at the state’s debt practices, and the more debt–service expenses limit the use of revenues for other programs. Figure 3 shows what California’s DSR has been in the recent past and our DSR projections for the forecast period.\nThe DSR we are projecting—slightly above 9 percent at its peak—is considerably higher than it has been in the past. This reflects the sharp, recent fall–off in General Fund revenues, the planned sale of the large bonds approved since 2006, and the voters’ recent approval of Propositions 22 and 26. To the extent additional bonds are authorized and sold in future years beyond those already approved, the state’s debt–service costs and DSR would be higher than projected in Figure 3.\n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        TRENTON, New Jersey - Jan. 11 - Following is the prepared text of Gov. Chris Christie's (R) 2011 state of the state address:\nLieutenant Governor Guadagno, Madam Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the Legislature, People of New Jersey: It is my constitutional duty to report to you each year on the State of our State. And today, it is my privilege to report to you that the State of our State is improving — getting better every day. Why do I say that?\nState spending is down 9% in one year. The budget has been balanced. State taxes are lower — for the first time in a decade. The unemployment rate has begun to drop — and today is below, not above, the national average. Companies are beginning to take a second look at New Jersey. Together, we have begun to do something no one thought was possible: we are turning our State around. Without a doubt, there is much work still to be done. But we cannot turn back now. Make no mistake: New Jersey is coming back.\nThink of where we were just one year ago: The FY ‘10 budget was over $2 billion in deficit — with the year more than half gone and our options shrinking fast. The state was actually in danger of running out of cash — within weeks of not being able to meet payroll. We faced a deficit for FY ‘11 that was projected to be $11 billion — equal to 37% of the budget — the largest deficit, in proportional terms, in the country. Property taxes had risen 70% in the prior 10 years. Independent analysts concluded we had the highest overall tax burden in America. Unemployment was at 10% — the highest in a generation, the highest in the region, and above the national average. Wealth, and jobs, and people were leaving our State. The New Jersey we love — the New Jersey of our youth — was in danger of slipping away.\nSome were beginning to write off New Jersey, doubting we could change what the newspapers called our “old, hide-bound ways.” Back then, the state’s largest newspaper opined: “taxes are too high as it is…” Another paper put it simply: “New Jersey must change course.” The Day of Reckoning had arrived — and arrived with a vengeance. We had a clear choice: To continue our reckless ways, or change course and choose a new, difficult path— one that would require real political courage from all those who embraced the change.\nWell, we did change course — decisively. Today, step by step, we are putting ourselves on a better, more sustainable path — and pushing ahead on the road to growth. Step one was to turn Trenton upside down — to reverse the pattern of increased spending and taxing; to upend the culture of burying problems instead of facing them.\nYou see, the right answer is to face big problems now ... Or face bigger ones tomorrow. I believe in a culture of truth. It hasn’t always been easy — because some of the truths in front of us were not pleasant. At the same time, everyone knew that the old direction was driving our State off a cliff — into the abyss of no growth, high unemployment, and a fleeing population. But we did begin by turning the mindset of Trenton around, and today, with your help, New Jersey’s comeback has begun.\nThe last year may have seemed like a long and winding road, but together, we have actually changed direction quickly. Look what has happened in just 12 months. Within three weeks of taking office, we took immediate action to prevent a financial crisis and stabilize the state’s finances. We balanced that FY ‘10 budget by holding back what spending could be stopped, and averted New Jersey’s cash crisis.\nWe enacted the first steps in reforming our system of pensions and benefits — saving state and local taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. We enacted legislation to head off the looming crisis in our unemployment insurance system — preventing a tax increase of as much as $700 per employee for many employers. We made a down payment — with unanimous support in the legislature, by the way — on an education reform package which created a permanent interdistrict public school choice program. And we approved 6 new charter schools in New Jersey — a small first step, but with many more to come soon\nWe passed an FY ‘11 budget which restored some sense of fiscal sanity — it required spending cuts from every department of state government — but we closed that $11 billion budget gap — without raising taxes. Most importantly, we took action on the problem which the people of New Jersey have been crying out for us to solve — the growth of their property taxes. We capped that growth at 2% per year. Then, we made the cap real by limiting interest arbitration awards to 2% as well. And in one year, New Jersey has gone from being a basket case to being a national model.\nThose same newspapers who thought we were in deep trouble are now telling a different story. One said, we have taken “the first step in a very new direction.” Another now says: “New Jersey is setting a national example.” So make no mistake: other states are watching what we do here. Will we turn back, because the road is too hard? Or will we press on, because the future is too important? New Jersey is getting recognized for taking on the tough issues that politicians have refused to touch. We are showing other states that sometimes, to create real change, you’ve got to go all in and show a little Jersey attitude.\nAnd this month, new governors are taking office across the country — Republicans and Democrats— many using New Jersey as the example of how they want to lead. The stakes are high. For example, one state — Illinois — has chosen a very different path. They are in the throes of debating a 75% increase in income tax rates. Is that what we want for New Jersey? No. New Jersey intends to remain the leader, not only in turning around the national trend of out-of-control spending and taxes, but in finding the path to growth.\nSo on every one of these topics, we have more and bigger things to do. We need to balance the budget, again. We need to put the unemployment insurance fund on a long-term sustainable path. We need much bigger and bolder education reform and steps to save our pension system. And we need to enact the entire tool kit which will help us stem the growth of property taxes. So have no doubt: we are not turning back — not on my watch.\nBut before I turn to the future, to the task ahead, I want to make two comments. First, who would’ve thunk it? If I, or the Senate President, or the Speaker, had told you a year ago that, by December, we would have a 2% hard cap on property taxes and a 2% hard cap on interest arbitration awards, you would have told us we were crazy. Yet here we are, with both caps in law. What happened? People stood up for their principles on the one hand, but listened to the people who sent us here on the other. This is the model for the way forward. We must fight hard for what we believe in, but in the end, we must do the people’s work.\nMy second comment is to say, to this Legislature, and to the public watching or listening today, “thank you.” We haven’t always agreed, and we haven’t always gotten exactly what we’ve wanted, but we have achieved compromise— and the people of New Jersey are better off as a result. One year ago, at my inauguration, I invited the Senate President and the Speaker to engage in a symbolic handshake of cooperation— a commitment to worry less about who is getting credit and more about doing something worth getting credit for. Today, I want to thank them both for using this last year of action to help begin to restore the public’s faith in Bi-partisan government.\nThe change we are working to achieve for New Jersey is transformational. So far, we have changed the terms of the debate: You know a lot has changed when the people of the State vote down a record number of school budgets— even though 70% of the money in school elections was spent by the teachers’ unions, advocating even higher spending. You know the debate has changed when my friends across the aisle propose legislation highlighting the need for tax cuts to stimulate economic growth. A year ago, they were advocating tax increases. You know our direction has changed when the teacher’s union starts talking about tenure reform. And you know the world has changed when we can come together and actually begin to reform the pension and benefit system— in a nearly unanimous vote.\nSo there can be no question... The debate in Trenton has changed. We have turned Trenton upside down. But now, we must take the next step. We must make even bigger changes in the year ahead if New Jersey is to be a place where families choose to live and work, and can afford to live and work. It is traditional in State of the State messages to provide a long list of initiatives for the year ahead. To touch on the plan for every department of State government. Today, I am going to break with that tradition. I want to highlight not the small things, but the major challenges that our state has ignored for too long, and that we must confront now. For New Jersey: it’s time to do the big things.\nFor this year, the biggest things fall in three categories: One: we must stick to the course of fiscal discipline. Two: we must fix our pension and health benefit systems in order to save them. And three: we must reform our schools to make them the best in the nation. On these three, what is at stake is no less than the future of New Jersey.\nYou see, we are in a global competition, and we are in a competition among states. If we cannot shed regulations, reduce spending, and hold the line on taxes, we cannot attract and create the jobs our citizens so desperately need. If we cannot make the promises of our pension system more realistic, there will be no pensions for those who have earned them. And if we cannot repair our schools, our people will not be ready for the jobs of the future. So our work is far from finished. And here is where we must go in 2011— on the big things, the things that really matter.\nFirst, we must continue the process of getting our fiscal house in order. We achieved balance in fiscal year 2011, but our long-term deficit problem is far from solved. It took years— indeed decades— to build up, so it cannot be solved in one year. So let’s be clear. We can’t continue to spend money we don’t have. We can’t print money, and we can’t run deficits. So we have to continue to make some very tough decisions about what we can afford— and what we can’t.\nNext month, I will present to you my budget for fiscal year 2012. I will guarantee you this: It will be balanced, and it will not raise taxes. In order for that to be true, we need to better control our Medicaid and health care costs. We need to continue to examine the amount and structure of municipal and school aid programs. And we need every department of state government to start from the bottom up and plan not what they want to cut from last year— but only what they absolutely must fund this year.\nWhen I talk of controlling spending, I am doing it for a reason. I am not proposing to cut spending just for cutting’s sake. I am fighting this fight because we have to be truthful about what we can’t afford—whether it is health and pension benefits which are out of line with the rest of the country, or a tunnel which we can’t pay for. I am asking for shared sacrifice so that when we leave here, New Jersey will be more fiscally sound than when we got here. I am asking for shared sacrifice in cutting what we don’t need so that we can invest in what we absolutely do need.\nLast week, former Governor Kean submitted the report of his commission on higher education, in which he made clear that our system of colleges and universities is essential to our economic growth. Governor Kean was right and I thank him for his commission’s report. I also last week outlined needed plans for continuing to invest in New Jersey’s transportation infrastructure— which we need to be world-class for both jobs and competitiveness. But if we are to fund these investments in the future, we have to control the costs in other programs. We need to make cuts in programs that have been shown not to work in order to make investments that will build a more productive tomorrow.\nSome people say that getting spending under control and reforming the budget is the third rail of politics. Well, I am here to tell you that I am not afraid to touch it— because its been said, opportunity expands in proportion to one’s courage. So I ask you to join me in cutting the popular in order to fund the necessary. And I will go further than that. It is one thing to just say no to higher taxes after decades of tax increases— 115 in the last 10 years alone. If New Jersey is to be a home for growth, we need to reform the taxes we place on business and individuals and begin to roll them back. So we need comprehensive tax reform -- and by that I mean changes that are considered together, not in a piecemeal approach. In my budget next month, I will propose the initial installment of such a package. But let's be clear: we will not put in place tax cuts that we can’t pay for. Any economic incentive package that I will sign will be enacted in the context, and only in the context, of a balanced budget.\nThe second big issue we must tackle this year is our antiquated and unsustainable pension and benefit system. This cloud hangs over us — and almost every state in the union. It is one of the reasons New Jerseyans pay the highest property taxes in America. Nearly 75% — 3 out of every 4 dollars — of our State’s municipal and county budgets are driven by personnel and labor costs. Without reform, pension and health care benefit costs will increase by more than 40% over the next four years. Without reform, the unfunded liability of our pension system will grow, from $54 billion today to a staggering $183 billion within 30 years. Without reform, the required annual pension contribution by the state will grow to over $13 billion annually over that same time period.\nJust to put that in perspective, that is more than New Jersey spends each year on its entire system of public education. The choice is clear — reform today, or risk disaster tomorrow. Without reform, the beneficiaries of the system face a high risk of catastrophe which would place all of their benefits at risk. So again, I am not proposing pension and benefit reforms just to be tight-fisted. I am proposing pension reform for the police officers who have served — and contributed — for years, but who may find nothing when they retire a decade from now. I am proposing pension reform for the firefighters who every day put their lives in danger to serve the public— and who have the right to expect that when the time comes, the public will serve them. I am proposing pension reform for the teachers who put in the extra hours every day to help their students. We now must put in the extra hours to ensure the system is solvent for them. The pension and benefit reforms I have put forward are simple, straightforward, and sensible.\nWe must modestly raise the retirement age in an era of longer life expectancy. We must curb the effect of COLAs in a time of low or no inflation. And we must ensure a modest but acceptable contribution from employees toward their own retirement system. Finally, if we can make real reform a reality, the State must also begin to make its pension contributions. Without reform, the problem we face is simple: Benefits are too rich, and contributions are too small, and the system is on a path to bankruptcy.\nA recent independent study found that the pension funds of 11 States will be out of money by 2020, just 9 years from today. New Jersey is one of those states. That is an unacceptable outcome. So to every beneficiary of the system: I am fighting for your pension. And to the members of the legislature, I say: Please join me in doing so. Now as part of our negotiation on interest arbitration, the Leadership of the Legislature promised to take up this necessary package of pension and benefit reforms. Now is the time for us to finish what we started last March. We should pass this package now. If you do, I will immediately sign it into law.\nThe third critical action item for this year — perhaps the biggest thing of all for the future of our State — is education reform. We cannot ask children and families stuck in chronically failing public schools to wait any longer. It is not acceptable that a child who is neglected in a New Jersey school must accept it because of their zip code. We must give parents and children a choice to attend better schools. Why do I say this? Let me tell you a story. A few years ago, I visited the Robert Treat Academy in Newark. Like those in many charter schools, the slots in this charter school — because it has been so successful, and because we do not have enough charter schools — are limited. So the slots were allocated by lottery. Near the end of my visit, I asked a mother of one of the students how she felt on the night her son was in the lottery. The way she framed the issue was simple, and in so many ways tragic. Whether her son was chosen for this lottery, she said, meant the difference between him going to college — or going to jail.\nOver 100,000 students are trapped in nearly 200 failing schools. This awful situation is unacceptable in New Jersey. We made some progress this year, with the interdistrict choice bill, with the expansion of charter schools, and with Mark Zuckerberg’s landmark $100 million gift to Newark. I thank Mark Zuckerberg, and I look forward to continuing my work with Mayor Cory Booker to reform Newark’s schools. But we need to tell those children, and those families, trapped in poor schools that we are coming— and that before this Legislature goes home we will give them more help toward improvement, more hope, and more choice.\nOur commitment to these principles is why I have asked, and I am honored to have, my friend, former D.C. Schools Chancellor, Michelle Rhee in this chamber today. No one in America has been more clear that we must change our public education system — from one that caters to the feelings of adults to one that prepares our children for the challenges of the 21st century. Michelle, thanks for coming today, and count New Jersey among those who are finally putting our students first. We must expand the charter school program beyond the six we approved this year and the 73 operating in New Jersey. That is a top priority.\nI am ready to work with you, the members of the Legislature, to attract the best charter school operators in America to New Jersey; to increase our authorizing capacity so they can start charter schools here; to implement the interdistrict school choice law we passed last year; and to send help now to children in failing schools by passing the bi-partisan opportunity scholarship act, without any further delay. Overall, statewide per pupil spending in New Jersey is the highest in the nation, at over $17,600 per student. But our results in terms of achievement are not number one, and they are not uniformly excellent or even acceptable. In multiple categories, and at multiple grade levels, the gap between at-risk students and those not at risk has not changed little in years — and it is way too high.\nWe must end the myth that more money equals better achievement. It is a failed legal theory— and we can no longer waste our children’s time or the public’s money waiting for it to finally work. The time for real reform is now. Here is what we must do: We must empower principals. We must reform poor-performing public schools or close them. We must cut out-of-classroom costs and focus our efforts on teachers and children. I propose that we reward the best teachers, based on merit, at the individual teacher level. I demand that layoffs, when they occur, be based on a merit system and not merely on seniority. I am committed to improving the measurement and evaluation of teachers, and I have an expert task force of teachers, principals, and administrators working on that issue right now. And perhaps the most important step in that process is to give schools more power to remove underperforming teachers.\nThe time for a national conversation on tenure is long past due. Teaching can no longer be the only profession where you have no rewards for excellence and no consequences for failure to perform. Let New Jersey lead the way again. The time to eliminate teacher tenure is now.\nNow, let’s be frank. The issues I have highlighted today are difficult. The process of cutting the budget; of being realistic about pension and health benefits; and of reforming our schools will get harder before the results make them seem easy. No doubt, in the months ahead, we will have to fight. Some might even say that I have been too ready for a fight— that my approach has been too tough and too combative. That's for a reason. It is because the fight is important. It is vital. The reality is I’ll fight when it matters. It matters because I have seen what so many New Jersey families are dealing with each day. For them this is not about politics — it is about their life. I fight when the issues are big— when it matters the most.\nSometimes that means we won’t agree. Sometimes you will oppose my proposals, and I will oppose yours. Sometimes I will veto a bill. But when I do so, it will because I genuinely believe it's in the best interest of the people of New Jersey.\n150 years ago, after his election and before his inauguration, Abraham Lincoln spoke here in this building — in the Statehouse in Trenton. On that day, speaking to a Legislature controlled by the other party, Lincoln noted: “... It may be necessary to put the foot down firmly. And if I do my duty, and do right, you will sustain me, will you not? Received, as I am, by the members of a Legislature the majority of whom do not agree with me in political sentiments, I trust that I may have their assistance in piloting the ship of State through this voyage, surrounded by perils as it is; for, if it should suffer attack now, there will be no pilot ever needed for another voyage.”\nOur challenges are different today, but our resolve must be the same. Because then as now, what is at stake is our future. 22 years ago today, another American leader spoke to his people. Famously, he was about big things— he focused on a major change in the direction of the country. It was president Ronald Reagan, one of my personal heroes, and on this day in 1989 he gave his farewell address to the Nation. He talked about America standing for freedom, not for the first time, but rediscovering it. That is what is going on in New Jersey. We don’t have to re-invent our state. We have a diverse and highly-educated workforce, a phenomenal base of infrastructure, and a state with physical beauty and tremendous talent. Today, we in New Jersey must rediscover our strengths— and put them to work for our people.\nReagan also pointed out in that speech that once you begin a great movement, there is no telling where it will end. In the last year, we have begun a new movement in New Jersey. A movement back to our roots. Back to economic dynamism and growth. Back to pride in our State. We cannot say today where it will lead and all that will come of it. But we know that the path of change is better than the path of stagnation that we were on.\nI was determined when I took the oath of this office to give the people an honest assessment of our problems. To tell them the truth, even if it was difficult and my proposed solutions were unpopular. And to this day, I ask that I be measured by that standard— I will always do what I said I was going to do. I may not offer the easiest course, but I will be direct in saying which course I believe to be the best. Our Nation, and our State, face major challenges ahead. But those of us entrusted to serve the public have the chance to stand up and fight for what really needs to be done at this critical time. So today, we cannot turn back. We owe it to the people of New Jersey to press on; to fight hard when it really matters; and to work every day to create real hope for a brighter future. For just as president Reagan spoke of America as a “shining city on a hill,” I believe New Jersey can once again be a beacon— a national leader in everything from economic growth to education, and a wonderful place to prosper, run a business, and raise a family. And my commitment to you today is to fight alongside each and every one of you to make it so.\nThank you, God bless New Jersey, and God bless the United States of America.\n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}
{"custom_id": "4_extracted-4993.json", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/chat/completions", "body": {"model": "gpt-5", "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an expert in detecting and analyzing fake news. Evaluate the credibility of the given statement and assign one of the following ratings:\n    • TRUE: The statement is entirely accurate and aligns with established facts or widely accepted knowledge. There are no significant errors, omissions, or misleading elements, and the information is consistent with reputable sources.\n    • mostly-true: The statement is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not substantially affect the core truth. These small details may be misleading or incomplete, but they don't change the overall message.\n    • half-true: The statement contains both true and false elements. Key parts are misleading, incomplete, or exaggerated in ways that distort the full picture. Important details that would provide a more accurate understanding are missing.\n    • barely-true: The statement is largely inaccurate, with the main claim being false or heavily exaggerated. However, a small portion of the truth exists, often peripheral or unrelated to the central claim. This truth does not substantially alter the misleading nature of the statement.\n    • FALSE: The statement is fundamentally incorrect. The core claim is unsupported by facts. While there may be some minor truths, they do not substantiate the central message, and the statement is misleading or factually inaccurate based on credible evidence.\n    • pants-fire: The statement is outright false and likely intended to deceive or manipulate the audience. It is unsupported by any credible evidence, facts, or reasoning, and its purpose is often to provoke or spread misinformation.\n\n    Use the following format for your evaluation:\n    Example 1:\n    Statement: \"The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It's never below zero.\"\n    Speaker: Donald Trump\n    Context: Presidential announcement speech\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Bureau of Economic Research, the gross domestic product has been below zero 42 times over 68 years, which contradicts the claim of it “never” happening. The statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 2:\n    Statement: \"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015.\"\n    Speaker: Facebook posts\n    Context: Social media posting\n    Label: Pants-Fire\n    Justification: The claim was based on a satirical article from a parody website, widely shared on social media. The information is entirely false, so the statement is rated \"pants-fire.\"\n\n    Example 3:\n    Statement: \"Under the health care law, everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\"\n    Speaker: Nancy Pelosi\n    Context: On 'Meet the Press'\n    Label: False\n    Justification: While a study cited by Pelosi suggested some people would pay less, the term \"everybody\" was misleading as not all individuals would benefit in the same way. Some people would actually pay more. Thus, the statement is rated \"False.\"\n\n    Your Task: Evaluate the provided statement, speaker, and context. Assign the appropriate credibility rating based on the scale above, and provide a clear justification using facts and evidence.\n\n    Output format (json):\n    You must respond with a single json object. The json object must have exactly the following keys:\n    - \"statement\": repeat the input statement text.\n    - \"speaker\": the speaker name.\n    - \"context\": the context text.\n    - \"label\": one of the six labels: \"TRUE\", \"mostly-true\", \"half-true\", \"barely-true\", \"FALSE\", or \"pants-fire\".\n    - \"justification\": a short explanation that cites evidence from the search results.\n\n    Return only this json object and nothing else.\n\n    The field \"Search Results\" below contains text snippets extracted from the top Google Search results related to the statement. These snippets are partial web page texts returned by search. Use them as factual evidence to support your evaluation. If fewer than three snippets are provided, use whatever is available.\n\n    \tStatement: Wisconsin election officials to accept Mickey Mouse, Hitler signatures on recall petitions.\n        Subject(s): elections,legal-issues\n        Speaker: maciver-institute\n        Speaker's Job Title: Think tank\n        State Info: Wisconsin\n        Party Affiliation: independent\n        Barely-True: 1\n        False: 0\n        Half-True: 0\n        Mostly-True: 1\n        Pants-Fire: 1\n        Context: a video\n        Search Results:\n        [URL1_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL1_TEXT_END]\n        [URL2_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL2_TEXT_END]\n        [URL3_TEXT_BEGIN]\n        \n        [URL3_TEXT_END]\n"}]}}
